Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Operator : Welcome to the Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com, in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call to discuss our first quarter results. Joining me on the call is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President, Finance, and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; and Mike Van De Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We will begin with opening remarks from Gary, followed by Tammy providing a review of our results and our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks. Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please refer to this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. I'll turn the call now over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary C. Kelly: Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results, $126 million, were excellent. I'm very pleased, very happy for all of our Southwest people. They worked very hard to get us to this point, and I am delighted to see them rewarded for their efforts. Demand was very strong and very steady and resilient, you might say, considering the extreme weather and all the flight cancellations. And I'm very grateful to our customers for hanging in there with us as well. The bad weather definitely cost us but we still managed to stay on plan. Fuel prices continued to be stable with some help from our fuel hedging program, and currently, we expect fuel price stability to continue with modest hedging protection, at least for 2014, at about 20% coverage. I'm very pleased with the progress on our 5 strategic initiatives, starting at the top : All-new Rapid Rewards is, of course, up and running and very smoothly. And in my opinion, and where our folks are delivering the best frequent flyer plan in the business, and it is exceeding our expectations. Next is the 737-800. We're now up to 54 units in the fleet. It's delivering high load factors, very strong revenues and, of course, lower unit cost. So very pleased with that initiative. Third is the rest of our fleet modernization. It's very much on track. The Evolve seating retrofits were completed last year, and those aircraft are also delivering the added revenues at a lower unit cost. The AirTran's 717 retirements are underway, gradually being replaced by 737s in Southwest. This, too, significantly boost revenue per trip for the, really, the same if not lower cost per trip. And then finally, we're continuing the accelerated retirement of the 737 Classics. All combined, these fleet activities are providing a boost to our fuel efficiency gains as well. We completed -- next, we completed the first phase of our reservation system replacement with the on-time launch of our new international reservation system that was done on January 27. And even more satisfactory, it's performed flawlessly. And finally, the last year of the AirTran integration is right on track. Aircraft remain transitioned out of AirTran and effectively into Southwest. Flight crews and dispatchers are transferring into Southwest at the same rate. Published flights are rapidly coming down in the AirTran brand and coming up in Southwest Airlines. The commercial aspect of the integration will be done by year end, and we'll have some wind-down activities that will spill into 2015 but all those should be invisible to customers. We'll launch more flights from LaGuardia, Reagan and Love Field as planned. LaGuardia and Reagan slots, of course, resulting from the AA divestitures, and then Love Field expansion is due to the repeal of the Wright Amendment. And then next year, we'll launch more international flights and out of our new international terminal that's under construction at Houston Hobby. So a lot of things going on in 2014 and they're clicking right along. We're working on our 2015 plans. We have a desire to grow modestly next year based on the results that we expect for 2014. We are on track to achieve our return on invested capital target for 2014 and of course, as usual, that assumes no change in economic fuel price or cost trends. But assuming we keep the fleet flat next year, our roughly 695 aircraft, given the large number of out-of-service airplanes that are coming back into service in 2015, in addition to the up-gauging effect of trading out 717s for 737s, as well as adding 737-800s, that would increase our seat capacity next year in the 2% to 3% range. But until we report otherwise, you should continue to assume a flat fleet for 2015, and that will allow for meaningful growth. Our balance sheet is in superb shape. It should strengthen this year as we continue to produce strong cash flow and pay down debt. At the same time, we've continued to reward our shareholders with share repurchases and increased dividends. And our liquidity is exceptionally strong, supporting these balance sheet moves. So in short, a great quarter and especially considering the weather, the integration drags that continue in the high percentage of developing markets. So I'm very, very pleased to be here with you all this morning. And now I want to turn it over to Tammy Romo, our CFO. Tammy Romo : All right. Thank you, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll begin with a quick summary of our overall results, and then I'll jump to the revenue and cost trends. As Gary said, our first quarter net income, excluding special items, was a record $126 million, which was $0.18 per diluted share, and that exceeded First Call consensus of $0.16. This was a significant improvement over our first quarter last year's $53 million, which was driven by improved performance each month of the quarter, especially March, which was a record profit performance. Our first quarter GAAP net income was also a record $152 million. Operating income, excluding special items, also set a first quarter record of $242 million, which was a stellar performance, especially considering the estimated $50 million reduction resulting from the winter storms. Our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended first quarter was 14.2%, which, on an aftertax basis, was 8.9%, which exceeded our average cost of capital. These are superb results, and I'm grateful to our Southwest and AirTran warriors for their outstanding efforts, especially during this year's challenging weather. We are close to our 15% pretax ROIC goal and we plan to hit it this year, although, of course, it's always difficult to predict the economy and fuel prices. But we will continue to exert every effort to hit it. Our record first quarter operating revenues increased 2% year-over-year to $4.2 billion on a 1% decrease year-over-year in ASMs. Solid load factors across all haulings and healthy contributions from our revenue products contributed to our very strong first quarter revenues. In addition, our strategic initiatives remain on track and continue to contribute significantly to our profitability. Both operating and passenger unit revenues were record first quarter performances. Our first quarter business travel trends were also strong with double-digit increases in corporate sales. Our passenger unit revenues grew 3.5% year-over-year, which included about 1 point benefit from significant winter storm cancellations that reduced revenues by about $45 million but on 1.7% fewer ASMs. January and February PRASM were each up over 5%, followed by a 1% increase year-over-year in March PRASM. This was an outstanding performance, especially considering 2-point year-over-year unit revenue headwind from increased seat gauge and stage length, which, of course, has a greater unit cost benefit. In addition, nearly 20% of our first quarter ASMs were under development. Our revenue strength has continued, thus far, into April, of course, benefiting from the Easter and Passover holiday shift. And based on current bookings and revenue trends thus far, we expect April PRASM to be up year-over-year in the 6% to 7% range. Keep in mind, April also benefits from easier year-over-year comps compared to May and June. Bookings for May and June are also currently solid. And just one other consideration, the July 4 holiday that falls on a Friday versus Thursday last year, which could impact June travels. Let's turn to freight and other revenues. And our freight revenues grew 2.6% year-over-year as we continued to expand our award-winning cargo service with the integration of our AirTran network, and other revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, largely due to the decrease in ancillary AirTran fees from a reduction in AirTran capacity, all as planned. Ancillary revenues on Southwest, however, did experience strength, which was driven by EarlyBird and our A1 through A15 select boarding and as well as pet fees. We currently expect second quarter other revenues to also decline year-over-year, likely at a greater rate than experienced in first quarter, again, due to the ongoing conversion of the AirTran network. I'll turn to fuel now. Our first quarter 2014 economic fuel price per gallon, including fuel taxes, was $3.08 per gallon, which was in line with our expectations, and this was 6% below first quarter last year's $3.29 per gallon. And that was largely driven by a favorable swing in jet juice [ph]. We also had a $0.06 hedging gain for the quarter and Brent also declined year-over-year, but that was partially offset by an increase in crack spread. Our first quarter results also benefited from better fuel efficiency as a result of our fleet modernization and other fuel conservation efforts. Our first quarter fuel burn improved by about 1% year-over-year and that also reduced our fuel cost by roughly $15 million. In our ongoing commitment to the environment, we recently operated our first flight utilizing our Boeing 737-800 equipped with Scimitar Winglets, and we are expecting annual fuel savings of approximately 5% to 5.5% per aircraft. Our hedging premiums, including below the line and other expenses, were $17 million at first quarter and we are currently expecting a similar amount in the second quarter. Our second quarter fuel consumption is -- we've got a modest hedge in place of about 15%, and that's varying crude oil positions. And based on our market prices, and this is as of April 21, and our current hedge position, our current second quarter 2014 economic fuel price is forecasted to be comparable to second quarter last year's $3.06 per gallon. Excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, our first quarter unit cost increased about 3.5% year-over-year, and approximately 3 points of that year-over-year unit increase related to winter storms during the first quarter. This better-than-expected cost performance was primarily due to favorable airport settlements that were not anticipated. And our operating cost also benefited from lower advertising and technology spend for the quarter that have been reallocated to later in the year. So based on current cost trends, we expect second quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 2% to 3% range. And for the full-year 2014, we are also expecting a 2% to 3% year-over-year increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended first quarter 2014 with $3.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, which included $10 million in collateral held from third parties. We had very healthy free cash flow for the first quarter with $712 million, which supported our ability to return $371 million to our shareholders through repurchasing of $315 million of stock and distributing $56 million in dividends. The repurchase of shares included a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program that was executed on February 24, at which time we received 7 million shares representing 75% of what we anticipated receiving under the program. The program will be completed by May 9, and at which time, if needed, we'll settle in either cash or shares. We have $20 million remaining under our $1.5 billion repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete this quarter. Since the initial buyback authorization in August 2011, and including our quarterly dividend payments, we've returned a meaningful $1.6 billion to our shareholders, which demonstrates our long-term standing commitment to return value to our shareholders. We made $46 million of debt payments during the first quarter. And as a reminder, we have approximately $500 million in debt in capital lease scheduled payments for the remainder of the year. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, was 38% as of March 31. Our 2014 capital spending forecast is approximately $1.8 billion and that does include the cost of the DCA slots. And about $1 billion to $1.1 billion of our total CapEx relates to firm aircraft spend. With this manageable level of capital spend, our cash flow outlook remains strong. And we also remain steadfast in our commitment to manage invested capital, which we've reduced by $1.1 billion since 2012. Our balance sheet is investment-grade and it is always a priority for us to keep that strong. Before I close, I will spend just a few minutes on our fleet. As you saw in the press release, we've provided the detail in the text of the press release. But to recap, our full-year 2014 fleet plans, we have 33 firm orders for -800s from Boeing and plan to add at least 14 preowned -700s. We removed 22 717s from service in 2013 and the remaining 66 717s will be removed from service by the end of the year, even though there will be some transitioning to Delta in 2015. As of the end of the first quarter, we have transitioned 24 717s to Delta. In addition, thus far, we have transitioned 21 of the 52 AirTran -700s to Southwest, which leaves 31 -700 aircraft remaining that we plan to transition before the end of this year. And as Gary mentioned, we have significant amount of activity we are managing this year as we wind down the AirTran brand and phase out the AirTran 717 fleet. And at a high level, we've been managing to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015, give or take a few aircraft, with a baseline of roughly 695 aircraft, which was our combined fleet at the time of the AirTran acquisition. Our flight schedule is currently published through October 31 of this year, and we will hold through our plan to maintain flat year-over-year ASMs for 2014. We haven't set our fleet -- our capacity plans for 2015. So while it's premature to give an ASM forecast for 2015, year-over-year growth in seats will be 2% to 3%. And this, of course, will have significant unit cost benefit as we anticipated and, of course, we've got exciting growth opportunities ahead such as Love Field and Houston Hobby international flying in 2015. Our commercial team has done an excellent job to-date of optimizing our network, and our operations team is doing a superb job managing a significant amount of conversion activity. In summary, we have not set our 2015 plans but we have options to flex capacity up or down, as needed. And our Classic retirement plan was built to provide flexibility and we can also augment our fleet needs through the preowned market. As we manage the integration work and removal of the 717s, we will augment the firm orders and preowned aircraft, and we may augment that beyond what we had disclosed in our press release. But again, all with the intention to manage to a flat fleet of 695 aircraft. All of this has been contemplated in our CapEx guidance of $1.8 billion for 2014, and our 2015 CapEx is expected to fall below 2014, with a flat fleet of 695 aircraft in mind. We have very exciting network opportunities, and we will manage with a continued focus on achieving and sustaining adequate returns on capital. So in closing, we had a very strong first quarter 2014 performance and second quarter trends support continued momentum. Our strategic plan is coming together very nicely, and we're recognizing substantial benefits from our initiatives and investments. We continue to have a disciplined growth strategy with flat year-over-year ASM capacity in 2014 and at least 2% to 3% seat growth in 2015. We expect healthy free cash flows this year with manageable CapEx and debt obligations in 2014 and '15, and we have an investment-grade balance sheet. We continue to return significant value to our shareholders through share repurchases, dividends and healthy earnings and our 15% ROIC goal remains unchanged. We are close to the goal and as I said earlier, we will continue to exert ourselves to hit that. And so with that, Tom, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Tammy, I think you talked about most of the AirTran -- or I think Gary had mentioned, by year end, that the commercial side will be -- will have been wound down. What's the carrying cost? Like, I can go onto the website, and there's an AirTran website, and I can call up and presumably, I'm speaking with an AirTran res employee even though they're a Southwest employee. What's that additional carrying cost that essentially goes away? Is it $30 million, $40 million a year? What's the number, how do we think about that? Tammy Romo : Just to make sure I'm tracking your question, Mike. You're asking what kind of inefficiencies do we have as we wind down the AirTran brand? Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes, the cost of just supporting a separate brand. I don't know if there's still any billboards left, but the signage -- I mean, there's -- obviously, to maintain it, there's got to be some cost associated with it that presumably would go away. Tammy Romo : Yes, no. There's -- we -- I agree with you. We certainly -- there are some inefficiencies as we maintain 2 brands, and just the fact that we -- just from a scheduling perspective and a crewing perspective and especially, given that we don't have a stable -- we've been managing our schedule through this integration. I agree with you, there will be -- should be some opportunities for improvement next year. We haven't -- we'll start to work on our plan here for 2015 very soon, but I would anticipate that there would be some efficiencies that we'll be able to gain next year. We haven't put a figure to it yet, but, yes, we'll certainly work to wring out any efficiencies that we can. And of course, our unit cost will also benefit from the up-gauging in our fleet modernization efforts as well. Gary C. Kelly: And, Mike, the only thing that I would add to that really perfect answer is that most of the obvious stuff is gone. So in other words, the way you were describing it, I don't think there are any material inefficiencies there by having a dual brand because our marketing folks are managing to one marketing budget. So you might say that the AirTran brand -- in other words, it's possible that the AirTran brand could be a bit under-supported, but in any event, I think there are definitely inefficiencies in the scheduling of 2 separate fleets that Tammy was referring to. And those, I think, we've at least described qualitatively but I don't think we have a number to that yet. But most of the obvious stuff is gone. We don't have 2 headquarters, we don't have 2 -- we don't have anything like 2 headquarters, departments operating, that's all consolidated into Southwest. So it's really the inefficiency of having 2 operating companies, I think, is where the big opportunity's here. Tammy Romo : Mike, I'll give you just one example of an inefficiency, it's just as we're going through the transition with the implementation of a new reservation system as an example. Right now, we are maintaining 3 reservation systems and, of course, with the goal to ultimately get to one. So we do have some of those inefficiencies that we'll continue to work through. So it's those types of ideas that we'll need to -- or opportunities that we'll need to continue to work as we plan for 2015 and even into 2016. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Great. And just my second question, you talked about the higher CapEx number due to the purchase of the slots. Have you called out what that number is, what you paid for the slots? And then sort of along those lines, I know that you've -- you're interested, obviously, in the Dallas Love Field gates. Are there other American U.S. Airways gates around their system that you'd be interested in or is it just Love Field? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I'll let Tammy speak to the slots. I believe that's confidential, so we have not disclosed that. But the Love Field gates are obviously -- there's only 2 of them, so it's a rather modest opportunity there. But in any event, at this point, we don't have any other interest. Tammy Romo : Mike, and the slots, the slots are confidential and we have not disclosed that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just on the seat growth in 2015. I know it's still very early stages but I was wondering, how much of that might be domestic versus international? Gary C. Kelly: Well, international, Savi, is so small. It's only 1% of our total capacity right now. The international opportunity that I highlighted that you're aware of out of Houston Hobby is fourth quarter. So it's not going to have a material capacity impact on 2015. If I'm thinking out loud, I think the vast majority is going to be domestic and probably oriented towards -- what we've already announced is our plans to expand the Dallas Love Field, so all of that will be domestic. So it'll be heavily weighted towards domestic. Robert E. Jordan: Yes, I would agree. It's really Dallas, and it's really the investment in the DCA slot flying and the LaGuardia slot flying that carries it into 2015. And as Gary said, our international business is a very small percent of the total already. So even Houston on that, for part of the year, it's a small percent of a small percent. So it's really the domestic. Gary C. Kelly: Now we -- and let me just repeat, again, that we're only published through October. So these are committed plans that Bob and I are sharing with you. That's just our -- assuming that the fleet is flat and assuming you see that kind of seat growth, that is what I would assume the split would be with those markets. But we could decide, just to be fair to your question, we could decide, between now and whenever we publish the second half schedule, that we want to put more capacity next year internationally. But that -- to me, that's what is assumed with that flat fleet. Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Understood. And then just on the national flights that you're switching from AirTran to Southwest, I know AirTran has some ancillary like baggage fees and other fees. Are you able to capture that through higher fares on these international flights? Or is maybe introducing bag fees on just international something you would consider? Gary C. Kelly: I think the answer to your first question is yes. You just look at the continued unit revenue growth. And that includes bringing down the AirTran brand and bringing those flights up at Southwest. And the other, there is no thought to confusing the brand by offering bag fees on certain flights like international. No. Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : All right. Great. And just if I may squeeze one last one related to this, just -- so 1% of ASMs today, how much and how fast could that increase, do you think, over the next few years, international? Gary C. Kelly: Well, again, I think it's premature. First of all, we're -- we want to grow but we're cautious. We -- the first priority here is to hit and sustain our return on capital. So I think that's really premature, but if -- I think it's going to continue to be a relatively modest component of the Southwest route system for the near future, for over the next several years. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America. Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Two questions on labor, Gary, Tammy. One is when I looked at the departures, they were down 5.9% in the quarter yet headcount was down only 1.4%? So why aren't we seeing -- it seems like your productivity, at least on the departure basis, got worse. And then, two, can you go over the profit-sharing calculation and how we should do that going forward, and whether current integration charges are now starting to flow through the profit-sharing line? Tammy Romo : Yes. Glenn, I think on just your question on trips relative to headcount, we obviously had a lot of inefficiency just due to -- I'll attribute that largely to the weather. And on the profit sharing, again, our profit sharing was $29 million for the quarter and that was reduced by $6 million related to acquisition and integration costs, half of which were incurred in first quarter '14, and the other half related to integration costs incurred from April 2011 through December 23, which was in accordance with our profit sharing plan. And so the integration costs that deferral period -- for that deferral period totaled about $385 million, and that will result, and this is probably what you need, Glenn, and that will result in $58 million of lower profit sharing expense to be recorded January '14 through December 2018, and $3 million of which lowered our first quarter '14 profit sharing expense. Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And additional integration cost, did those now impact profit sharing? Are those also... Tammy Romo : Those just flow right through, like you normally would. So that was our -- we're past our cutoff period. So yes, that would just flow through the profit sharing calculation as normal. Gary C. Kelly: Glenn, on your headcount productivity question, the other thing -- and of course, I know you know all this, but you can't just use trips as the only proxy for the headcount. So the available seat miles are probably a better proxy for flight crews. And then the trips are also getting -- some of them are getting more flight attendants per trip as an example. So there's a -- while, yes, the trips are down, and it does provide some relief for some workgroups, it is certainly not all. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC: So Tammy, about a year ago, you said you guys are going to tighten some flexibility around some of your most restricted fares, and you said it was going to be done later in 2013. I'm kind of curious what you did, what you found out and if it was successful or not and if there's anything you can do going forward on that. Tammy Romo : Yes. Hunter, what we did recently is we did tighten restrictions on our Wanna Get Away fares, and that's just essentially -- it's just a no-show. I would consider that really more of a no-show penalty, and essentially, if you don't call and cancel your flight, those funds would be forfeited. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. You're -- specifically for the No Show policy? Tammy Romo : That's right. That's exactly what I was referring to. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And can we talk about sort of the relationship between advertising expense and distribution strategy. You guys spend about $200-plus million a year on advertising, which is a lot. And I understand that because you need people to go to southwest.com to buy your tickets. But have you thought about that in the context of maybe putting some more of your inventory on online travel agencies? That would give you more exposure that way and maybe alleviate some of the expense on the advertising side that you would have to get in people's minds to go to southwest.com. If they just go to Expedia and see your fare there, maybe you could spend a little bit less on advertising while sort of also tweaking the distribution strategy a little bit. Any thoughts on the relationship between those 2? Tammy Romo : Well, Hunter, I guess I'll comment and then see if Gary or Bob have anything to add. But in terms of -- usually, the online, as you know, those are usually customers looking for discount fares, and we have no issue with that on southwest.com. We drive a lot of customers to southwest.com because they know that they can rely on us for low fares. And just another, I think, interesting fact, too, is that once we started distributing AirTran fares on southwest.com, we quickly became their largest distribution channel. So we're always looking at advertising and always looking for ways to spend those dollars more efficiently, and we'll obviously continue to do that going forward. But at this point, we don't have any major changes contemplated for our distribution strategy. Robert E. Jordan: Yes, Hunter. This is Bob. I'll just add a couple of more things. Obviously, AirTran uses the OTAs, and to Tammy's point, we've seen no issue converting AirTran market flights to -- and customers to southwest.com. In fact, those markets are converting and maturing at a rate that's better than a typical new market for Southwest, so I really believe in our distribution strategy. The other thing really on the advertising, when you comp us to others, you've got to think about total distribution costs. So what's -- what you've got to add back are they're paying for GDS fees and bookings, and there are all kinds of costs that you have to look at in total as distribution, in addition to just advertising. And every time we look at that across all of our competitors, we are in the lowest, whether you look at that on a per-passenger basis or a per-revenue-generated basis. So I'm very comfortable with where our costs are, if you look at total distribution costs, which would include advertising. But as Tammy said, we're always watching our advertising costs. I mean, as an example only, we're managing the combined AirTran and Southwest brand basically at the same level of advertising cost that was Southwest only prior, so we're constantly looking for efficiencies there. Tammy Romo : Yes. And we certainly have realized that, to Bob's point, which all that's been factored into the synergy numbers that we provided for AirTran. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Gary and Tammy, definitely appreciate the additional color on seat count growth next year. Of course, some of that is sort of onetime in nature. I'm curious if the team is willing to speak to a long-term ASM growth rate. If we envision a world where you're hitting your 15% ROIC target, what would be like a steady-state Southwest growth rate? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I think it's premature to say. I think that's really not so much a strategic question as it is tactical. This is a very tactical business, and especially when it comes to growth and growth opportunities, I think, number one, is you have to have a strong balance sheet. Number two, you have to have confidence that your earnings will provide adequate returns, and then you have to be confident that you know how to manage growth. So we've been a growth company for most of our history, and I do feel like the company has a lot of institutional knowledge about how to identify new markets and about how long it takes to develop them and about how much should be exposed at any given point in time. The other factor, of course, over a longer period of time that is key to your question is what are fuel prices going to be; and then, secondly, what our overall costs going to be because that will mean everything about generating more passengers and traffic and share for Southwest Airlines. So under the assumption that we continue to be if not the low cost producer or darn near close to it and maintain our low fare brand and fuel prices remain stable over the next decade, I think we have significant opportunities to grow the fleet from here. I wouldn't say that that's 10% per annum, I think that, that was for this industry and for our company otherwise. So something in the low-single digits makes sense in terms of a planning horizon. But you are right to point out, John, that here, in the meantime, when you go from 2012 to '13 to '14 to '15, there's a lot of noise from year-to-year. And so once we get clear of 2015, that's something we'll be focused on, and we'll want to manage our growth very carefully and again, with an eye towards keeping the balance sheet strong and hitting our return on capital. John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : That is very thorough. And the good part about the noise, as you mentioned, Gary, in your prepared remarks is that it's going to improve the cost structure. When we think about all of the moving parts in 2015 and we think about sort of the seat utilization kind of popping back on the up-gauging from the -800 and the change in mix there, as well as perhaps even going back to Mike's question earlier on some of these AirTran expenses going away, I mean, it seems natural to think that we should see a deceleration meaningfully in the CASM x fuel growth, perhaps even a flat to down trend given all these numbers. I'm not sure if I've got the moving parts right. Maybe I'm missing some risks outside of labor. If you could just help me kind of think through that directionally, that would be helpful. Gary C. Kelly: Well -- and Tammy, you chime in, too. John, you've been very thorough as well in your analysis. That is all intuitive. We have the same view that you do. We have not finalized our plan yet, and therefore, we're just not ready to provide any guidance. But if you think about the swap from the 717 to the 737, just to repeat what I said in my remarks, the costs are essentially the same. They may even be lower to operate the same number of airplanes, yet you're getting 26 more seats on every single departure. So when we talk about growth for Southwest next year, I'm not going to argue to you that it's free because it is true that we can choose to have fewer airplanes if we don't believe that we can generate that much traffic. But you're right, with this -- the growth we're talking about in the near term should come at a very modest cost relative to a normal view of a fully allocated unit of growth. So that certainly factors in somewhat to our thinking, but the bottom line is we need to be comfortable that we can generate traffic to absorb the increase in seats that we are planning for next year. So if we end up growing seats 2.5% next year, then we need to be comfortable that we'll grow our traffic by 2.5%. If we don't, then I don't think that we should be pursuing it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I guess my understanding, the part of the reason you're keeping capacity flat this year is to facilitate ROIC improvement. So does that imply simply that growing capacity is a negative for ROIC? Gary C. Kelly: No, but I think it's just common sense that tells you that if your base business is not achieving your return target, why would you increase the base? I think it's just that simple. As a practical matter, the other thing that we keep reminding you and everyone about is that there's just a lot of work going on. So the aircraft movements out of Southwest, AirTran and into Southwest are going to be in record numbers. And then for Mike Van De Ven and our operating departments, that creates record numbers of training events for employees, so it's a lot of activity to manage. If you then said, \"Now I want to grow by x number of aircraft on top of that,\" I just think that that is unwise on its face. So for several reasons, we want to maintain relatively flat capacity in 2014, but the main reason is we haven't hit our 15% target yet. So I think we need to do that first and then make a judgment about whether that's sustainable with growth. Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Yes, that's helpful. On the flexibility you have in terms of capacity for 2015, should I think about the driver there in terms of up or down, is that really going to be a function of the demand and pricing trends that you're seeing? Or should I think of it more as you guys using that as a means of managing kind of CASM growth? Tammy Romo : I think it's demand. Yes, clearly, what we're trying to do is optimize the network to match customer demand, and I think our commercial team is doing a great job with the network and -- as evidenced by our first quarter results. Gary C. Kelly: And again, that's what I was trying to say earlier, which is if we're going to increase seats, we need to be comfortable that we will also increase customers. It helps mitigate the risk to know that the growth is going to come online at a very attractive cost, but that's not the reason to grow. The reason to grow is because we believe we can increase the traffic and the revenues and then it would, again, come hopefully at a very attractive cost of debt service. Operator : We'll take our next question from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Tammy, can I just ask you with regard to some cost items, can you provide a little more color on the maintenance side? I think you had mentioned that there was a little bit of delay or deferral in Q1. Should we assume that that gets pushed into Q2? And if you could quantify that to some extent, I would appreciate it. Tammy Romo : Yes. Our maintenance costs that we did have, that came out a little bit lower than expected for first quarter just due to shifting. But all of that has been incorporated into the guidance that we gave you, so it's not -- I don't -- it's not material. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just a minor point but I'm curious as to what drove the 5% increase in other OpEx. Tammy Romo : Oh, part of that is weather. If you look at our increase, the 3.5% CASM increase, unit cost increase, excluding profit sharing and special items, really, most of that was attributable to weather for the quarter. And we also had some shifting in our technology spend, but -- so some of that will get shifted out throughout the rest of the year. But again, that's been incorporated into our 2% to 3% increase for the full year in that guidance. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays. David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Gary, can you remind me -- we've been talking a lot about the 15% return target. Can you remind me why it's 15%? I mean it's something that I can -- I just remember as long as I've been around. I mean -- and I suspect it came in the '90s when 15% probably meant something much bigger than it does today. And what I mean by that is 15% now as a return target, not dissimilar from your other large competitors, and frankly, it's lower than really the growth-oriented carriers. So when you start thinking about growth and return targets, shouldn't that target really be much higher? Gary C. Kelly: I don't have a problem in debating where the target should be. And as -- I think it also depends on how fast one grows. So if we don't grow, I think that the target probably should go up. If we do grow -- the main thing is are we creating shareholder value or not. And so it's a matter of art as to how much of a premium over our weighted average cost of capital we need to be earning. You look at -- of course, you're an expert at this. You look at broader indices or broader performance across industries, which we do, and feel like the 15% is an adequate return. But that's something that we obviously would continue to consider and talk with our major shareholders about. And so the other thing, and you know the industry well, that I would remind you is that there are very few -- there are no airlines who have hit a 15% return on invested capital over this cycle except for Southwest Airlines. And that is what we did in the '70s. That's what we did in the '80s, and that's what we did in the '90s. So that history alone would tell you that it is not -- it's not a layup to hit that. But in any event, Tammy already said that that's our target and the target has not changed. Does that mean that it will forever be 15%? No. I don't think -- I wouldn't say it that way, but certainly, for 2014, we work very hard for a decade to get to this point and are not going to be ashamed to turn in that kind of performance, if that's the way it turns out. David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. No, that's helpful. It just helps to kind of put the -- frame the debate around the fleet growth. That's very helpful. The other question I actually intended to ask was, can you just help us think a little bit about aircraft utilization and maybe even broader asset utilization kind of going forward? I mean, historically, you've run kind of sweat the assets. It's a little more tactical business now in terms of keeping schedules in the meat of the day and the meat of the year, so to speak. I mean, should -- when we're thinking about aircraft utilization over time, should we be assuming that you don't go back to where maybe Southwest ran 5, 6, 7 years ago? Gary C. Kelly: Well, David, you -- again, you know us well, and you know this business very well. The utilization, just as a quick refresher, has varied a little bit since we bought AirTran. So AirTran, as a unit, has never been, I would say, efficiently scheduled. So we've had a little bit of slop in there. And then, of course, we've had a lot of aircraft out of service in 2013 and now in 2014, going through various conversions, either of all the seats or now converting airplanes out to Delta or converting them into Southwest, all the things that you know about. So at least we can say that we are underutilized right now and that the utilization will improve once we get clear of this integration work in 2015 and, especially, 2016. So that, we can agree to. As to will the airline schedule the way that it did before 2008 or '09 where we had a lot of early morning flights, a lot of late evening flights, I don't think so. And again, I think we just only have to be open to the fact that things might change. But unless the demand reappears at that time of the day and it is efficient to schedule an airplane on a marginal cost basis, I don't see that that flying will come back. But you've got $100 crude oil, $110 crude oil today compared to a time where it was $10 to $20 a barrel, which made it more viable to operate flights on the shoulders with less than 50% load factors, and that's just not the case today. So as long as that case remains, then absolutely, you'll see the flight schedule in the meat of the day. And Bob, we're probably at the highest percentage ever. Aren't we about 88%, 89%, 90% scheduled between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.? Robert E. Jordan: We are. We -- for 5 years now, we've cut those early and late flights really just based on demand. I mean, it's a flight-by-flight, market-by-market exercise. And yet, we've got more flights than ever where the demand is in the day, so I think it's a great thing from a financial and flight performance perspective. Yes, I would expect that -- I wouldn't expect that trend cutting early and late to continue at the pace it has over the past 5 years. So I think we're more stable now, but I don't see us going back. Gary C. Kelly: For us, we've got opportunities to consider. Red-eye flying and things like that, and that is something that Bob and Mike are thinking about, but we don't have any plans to make any material change in the way we're scheduling the fleet, for any reason for that matter. But that would be the 1 exception perhaps to the shoulder flying comments. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a quick clarification for Tammy on non-passenger demand. Did you say other revenue would decline here a bit more than in Q1 or freight mail and other. It doesn't make a huge difference, but I wanted to clarify. Tammy Romo : I said other. And that's just obviously, as we're moving AirTran flying over to Southwest, that would be the ancillary revenues. But -- and so we'll see that's just simply the remainder of ancillary charges going away as we move them over to the AirTran brand. Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. And then, a question -- I'm sorry, were you adding something else? Gary C. Kelly: Jamie, I was just going to clarify that at least on the freight side, since we haven't talked about freight, we are adding more and more markets since AirTran did not previously carry freight. So I think we have decent opportunities to grow the freight revenue category. But the other category that you asked about that Tammy mentioned, yes, that will continue to decline. Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it, got it. And then, Gary, a question on the progress with the pilots. The challenge that I'm facing is that your existing contract already appears to be among the industry's more, if not most, efficient. And I certainly understand that the pilots like to see wages increase. I mean, that makes perfectly good sense. What's less clear is what management's ask [ph] might look like in terms of improved economics. It's not like you need scope really for RJs or anything like that. So I know you don't want to negotiate in public, but are there any competitor contracts that you could point to and you'd say, \"Hey, Airline X over there has some really interesting flexibility in the pilot contracts,\" something like that? Gary C. Kelly: Well, Jamie, you're right, we are efficient. But we have things that are tangible today that are under discussion that would give Southwest more flexibility and make Southwest more efficient. So as good as we are, there are always things that can change. And as a matter of fact, there are absolutely some examples with competitors. And if you will permit me, I won't share who those are. But in any event, absolutely, there's always opportunities with every workgroup, always, to find ways to improve. And the nice thing is we're doing well, we've got good news, there are definitely some things that we can do for our people going forward as well and keep Southwest strong and build well for all our employees, and that's a wonderful place to be. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom. And as always, if there are any follow-on questions, please feel free to call. We appreciate you all joining today, and have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communication and Outreach. Linda B. Rutherford: Thanks, Tom. For the media folks on the call, if you've got a question, go ahead. And Tom, let them know how they can queue up for that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now begin with our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News. Terry Maxon : As you are probably aware of, Virgin America has scheduled an event tomorrow to announce something about their Dallas operations. The -- have you got a sense that the competition for those gates have been settled? Have you gotten any word whether Virgin America is getting them or that you're out of the competition for them? Gary C. Kelly: Terry, we are waiting patiently to see what the next step is in the process. So as far as I am aware, we are still in the running for consideration. Terry Maxon : Delta wants the City of Dallas to take control of the gates and make them common use gates. Is that an acceptable alternative to Southwest? Or do you believe that, one way or the other, one airline should definitely get them? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I think that sort of gets into the contractual aspect of the lease, and nothing that I really want to comment on. So I can understand why somebody would argue for that, but it's going to be up to the City of Dallas and its lease with American and their sublease rights to determine how to apply this. So I'd rather not comment on that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star Telegram. Andrea Ahles : So I think Terry asked part of my question, which is about the Love Field gates. But I was wondering if you could also talk about how has demand been for the new flights since you released the schedule? Have you had a lot of interested people on the Love Field flights and which might be getting on it [ph] ? Are you considering other cities you might be adding in 2015 if you get those gates or if -- as you start to improve your schedule going forward at Love Field? Gary C. Kelly: Well, Love Field is -- of course, it's going to happen, so we've already preannounced that we'll be selling more flights to more destinations sometime soon. So we're not taking bookings yet, Andrea, as I think you know, on the 15 new nonstop destinations that we've announced. That's a \"stay tuned.\" I think Tammy mentioned already that our business out of Love Field is up significantly. It's up double digit this year even without the new flights yet. So I don't know that we can quite explain that other than just a great service that our Southwest warriors offer every day. But yes, our business in Love Field is good, and we're looking forward to launching the new service here later this year. Andrea Ahles : Do you know when you're going to make those flights available for purchase? Gary C. Kelly: I do know. Andrea Ahles : When would that be? Gary C. Kelly: Linda, have we disclosed that yet? Linda B. Rutherford: We've not yet at the time. Gary C. Kelly: We haven't said that yet, so stay tuned. Operator : We'll take our last question from Aaron Karp with Air Transport World. Aaron Karp : You talked about how you think the international flying will be a relatively modest component for the next few years. How much of a revenue enhancement do you think international will be near term? And are you looking at it primarily as a long-term growth opportunity? Gary C. Kelly: Well, over the long term, I think it's a large opportunity. We're thinking about it as North America. I would throw in Hawaii and Alaska, just because it is so different than flying in the 48 states, into that whole growth opportunity. We serve 96 cities today with Southwest and AirTran and have a potential to add 50 new destinations over some period of time, and that would be several hundreds worth of airplanes -- worth of flying. So it's a very material opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, growing the airline is, in many ways, tactical. We've made the strategic investment to create the capability at Southwest to fly beyond the borders and to fly longer distances. So that strategic decision is made and is in place. Then where we decide to go within that geographic footprint, that will depend on a lot of factors. But in any event, I would absolutely expect that 1% would grow as a percentage of our total. At what rate, I'm not willing to predict yet. Bob, I don't know if you have a number off the top of your head, what the potential is. I don't think it's going to be half of our business. It's not going to be anything like that. I'd be surprised if it was 25% of our business. But it could probably be in the 10%, 15% range, don't you think? Robert E. Jordan: Yes, I think so. The domestic market is obviously much more mature. So the international markets that we're looking at are -- there's still a lot of room for development, so more room for competition, a lot of higher fares. Obviously, those will connect very well to our very mature domestic network, our very wide domestic network. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there. But it's a lot of opportunity on a relatively small base compared to the total. So yes, I would expect, to Gary's number, sort of the high-single digits, low-double digits is where I feel like we can grow to. But again, that growth rate -- the growth potential on the current base is much larger simply because the base is so small today. Gary C. Kelly: And again, this all assumes 737 service. The geographic footprint is all of North America, including the Caribbean and actually, the northern reaches of South America. So it's a very exciting opportunity, 200 airplanes. I didn't do the math in my head, but that would be about, not quite 1/3 increase in the fleet. So it's longer-haul flying, which takes longer, and it is higher revenue, so maybe our 10% to% 15 estimate is low. But we need to walk before we run here, and we're excited and ready to get started. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford: Thank you, Tom. If anybody has any follow-up, members of the media can reach out to our folks in the communications department, and have a wonderful afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.",

My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter results. On the call today is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President, Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, President of AirTran Airways; and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer. We will begin with opening remarks from Gary, followed by Tammy providing overview of our results and current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks. Please be advised, today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. And Gary, now we'll turn it over to you for opening remarks. Gary C. Kelly: Thank you very much, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings. We're very pleased with the second quarter performance. I'd like to point out a list of things before Tammy takes us through the financial results. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, for successfully transforming Southwest Airlines, for these stellar earnings results and then for the historic year of 2014 that they are managing. Second, the quarterly results include significant planned benefits from our all-new Rapid Rewards program, the AirTran acquisition and our fleet modernization. We would not have these results without these initiatives. Third, the network optimization over the last 5 years has paid off handsomely, supported, of course, by our strategic initiative, but we have significant market strength across our route network. It is very impressive. It's very encouraging. And while we have a very large percentage of the network under development, almost 20%, unlike a year ago, it's not a significant drag on our performance. And we've got reason to believe that this segment will mature rapidly. Fourth, the cost control efforts, which is essentially our fleet modernization initiative, is working very well, producing fuel efficiency, as well as nonfuel efficiencies. Fifth, we have a number of large nonroutine programs and projects that are being managed. Several become final this year, International, the repeal of the Wright Amendment and the completion of the AirTran integration. Let me just go through each of those very quickly. First, we've finished and launched international right on schedule. That is a very key milestone for wrapping up the AirTran integration. There are probably thousands of people to thank for what has been a flawless effort to get international up and running for Southwest Airlines. And I am very grateful to them all, but in particular, our technology department and their leadership on this project. The repeal of the Wright Amendment is now 88 days away. The schedule's out for sale. It is a superb schedule. The airport construction is close to completion. The airport is also working superb, and our marketing and advertising is in full swing and it is superb. We've got more surprises planned for the fall. It will be a joyous celebration after 35 years of restrictions at Dallas Love Field. And then finally, we are right on track to move airplanes and people out of AirTran and into Southwest by year end, to convert the remaining airports and routes from AirTran to Southwest by year end and then retire the AirTran brand and the few remaining Boeing 717s that we'll have by year end. And of course, that's a lot of work that I just ticked through, and our people are doing a superb job of managing all of that. Sixth, we are continuing to generate very strong cash flow, allowing us to reduce debt, reduce outstanding shares, return value to shareholders with LUV at a lifetime high. We've got a $1 billion-plus share repurchase authorization to continue returning value to our shareholders, along with our quarterly dividend. And that was just increased by 50% by our board in our main meeting. And then finally, our third quarter earnings outlook is strong. That, of course, is at this point in time. We'll continue to closely monitor our results and our outlook, the economy and fuel prices as we now contemplate reasoned and measured available seat mile growth beginning in 2015. And our immediate priority with growth is, of course, Dallas Love Field, number one; and then secondly, Washington Reagan. That is as we begin to operate and fly the slots that we acquired from American earlier this year for Washington Reagan. And our focus will be reliable, excellent operations, outstanding customer service and consistent, strong profits, which means a return on invested capital of at least 15%. And as planned, we've got tremendous growth opportunities that have been enabled beyond 2014. And that really is a remarkable change since just 2010. And all of that is a wonderful thing. But those opportunities will have to be prioritized, and they'll have to be pursued in a manner that allows us to achieve our annual goals. And again to repeat those, it is excellent, reliable operations; it is outstanding customer service and consistent profits at our target -- targeted ROIC of at least 15%. So Tammy, with that overview, I'd like to turn it over to you. And congratulations, Ms. Romo, on a wonderful quarter Tammy Romo : Well, thank you, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we reported, our second quarter 2014 net income, excluding special items, was $495 million or $0.70 per diluted share, which represents our fifth consecutive quarter of record profitability. These are very strong results, and we are seeing significant benefits from our strategic initiative. Our profits were up 77%, with EPS up 84%, which is a significant year-over-year improvement. And that was driven by strong revenues, lower fuel prices and our ongoing cost control efforts. Our second quarter GAAP net income was also a record $465 million. Our operating income, excluding special items, also set a second quarter record and produced a stellar 16.3% operating margin. And of course, I'm delighted to say our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended June 30 was 17.1%, which, on an after-tax basis was 10.7%, well exceeding our weighted average cost of capital. This is a tremendous accomplishment that required much work and focus by all of our people, and I congratulate and thank all of our outstanding employees for the strong financial results released this morning. Our second quarter revenue performance was very strong, and we broke many records. Operating revenues increased to a record $5 billion, driven by record passenger revenues of $4.8 billion, which increased 8.5% year-over-year on relatively flat ASM. Strong demand for travel, both business and leisure, resulted in record traffic, passenger yields and load factors. And as Gary already said, our strategic initiatives also significantly contributed to our record second quarter revenues. I also want to mention that our second quarter passenger revenues included $47 million related to a change to previously recorded estimates of tickets expected to spoil in the future. But with or without this additional revenue, passenger unit revenues were very, very strong. And as we reported, PRASM grew 9% year-over-year, and that was supported by unit revenue strength across all regions and lengths of haul. This was an outstanding performance, especially considering roughly 2-point year-over-year unit revenue headwind from increased seat gauge and stage length, which, of course, had an even greater unit cost benefit. As Gary already mentioned, we had close to 20% of our second quarter ASMs under development, which is significantly higher than historical norms. And our international and other developing markets, resulting in large part from the AirTran integration, are ramping up nicely and are performing in line with our expectations. Strong revenue trends have continued, [indiscernible] per quarter. And based on current bookings and revenue trends, we expect July's PRASM to be up year-over-year, roughly 3% over last July's strong performance. And bookings for August and September are also good. So our revenue outlook for third quarter is quite good. But keep in mind, third quarter year-over-year comparisons will be more challenging due to the strong prior year trends. Moving to freight and other revenues. Freight revenues grew 2.3% year-over-year as we continue to expand cargo service with the integration of our AirTran network. And we currently expect third quarter freight revenue to be comparable to second quarter. And although we had solid gains in our ancillary products, other revenues declined year-over-year as expected due to this decrease in fees, of course, as we wind down the AirTran line. And other ancillary revenues were also $58 million. We currently expect other revenues in third quarter to also decline year-over-year, likely at a greater year-over-year rate than we experienced in second quarter. And that's simply due to the ongoing conversion of the AirTran network. Turning to costs. We had a solid performance with operating costs comparable to second quarter last year. And on a unit basis, costs, excluding special items, increased only 1.2%. In addition to the cost reductions from our strategic initiatives, we also benefited from lower fuel costs. Our second quarter economic fuel price per gallon was $3.02 per gallon, which reflected a $0.05 hedging gain. And our fleet modernization and other fuel conservation initiatives improved fuel burn by 1.4% year-over-year, which reduced our second quarter fuel costs by approximately $20 million. Our third quarter fuel hedge consists of 10%. It's 10% hedged at varying crude oil prices and about 25% in Gulf Coast jet varying prices. Based on market prices as of July 21 and our current hedge position, our third quarter 2014 economic fuel price is forecast to be in the $2.95 to $3 range. And our hedging premiums are estimated to be about $15 million in the third quarter. Excluding special items and fuel and oil expense, our unit costs were up 3.4%. A significant portion of this increase was driven by a record profit sharing of $127 million. And when you exclude profit sharing, our unit costs increased just 1.7% year-over-year. And this was slightly better than our 2% to 3% guidance on unit costs, primarily due to the shift of certain costs such as advertising and training to the second half of the year. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year, similar to what we saw in the second quarter, which was a 1.7% year-over-year increase. Turning to our very healthy balance sheet and cash flow. We ended second quarter 2014 with $4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which included $105 million in collateral held from third parties. Our free cash flow during the second quarter was a strong $838 million. And year-to-date, we have generated approximately $1.6 billion. As a result of our strong free cash flow generation, we've returned $652 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of $555 million in stock and the distribution of $97 million in dividends for the first half of this year. And since August 2011, our buyback authorization at that time and including our quarterly dividend payments, we returned a meaningful $1.9 billion to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased $240 million in shares and distributed $42 million in dividend payments including our June payment, which represented our 151st consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareholders in our history. We have $780 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which was announced in May, along with a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend. And since the acquisition of AirTran, we've also reduced our debt and capital lease obligations net by a significant $1.5 billion and intend to repay an additional $440 million, and scheduled that in capital lease payments for the second half of this year. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, was 37% as of the end of June. Our 2014 capital spending forecast remains at approximately $1.8 billion, with $1 billion to $1.1 billion of that related to firm aircraft spend. And that brings me to the fleet, and I'll refer you to our press release for our second quarter activity. But here's a quick recap of our full year 2014 fleet plans. We have 33 firm orders for 737-800 from Boeing and plan to add at least 17 preowned 737-700. We've removed 41 of the AirTran 717s from service. The remaining 47 will be removed from service by the end of this year. As of the end of the second quarter, we've transitioned 36 717s to Delta and currently plan to transition 16 more this year. In addition, thus far, we've transitioned 24 of the 52 AirTran -700s to Southwest, which will leave 28 -700 aircraft remaining that we plan to transition before the end of this year. Our fleet plans still includes managing to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015 with a baseline of roughly 695 aircraft, which, again, was our combined fleet at the time of the AirTran acquisition. We expect our third quarter 2014 ASMs to increase year-over-year approximately 2% and full year 2014 ASMs to be up under 1% year-over-year. And again for 2015, we expect our available seat miles to increase year-over-year, and that's driven by the 2% to 3% increase expected in seats from the updating of our fleet, along with the higher utilization of our fleet post-integration. 2015 ASMs are also expected to grow from a longer stage length on the new flights at Love Field, DCA, LaGuardia and new international flying from Houston. As we manage the integration work and removal of the 717s and as previously guided, we plan to augment the firm orders and free [ph] on aircraft beyond what we have disclosed in our press release. So really, no new news there. To close, we are delighted with our second quarter earnings performance, which exceeded our expectations. Our Southwest warriors have worked very hard to execute our strategic initiatives and restore our financial performance. And it's very gratifying to see how well it's all coming together here in 2014. The benefits relating to the AirTran integration, our fleet modernization efforts, the -800s, and our new Rapid Rewards program are all meeting or exceeding expectations. And the full replacement of our reservation system is off to a great start. July 1 was a day of great pride here at Southwest as we successfully launched international service to Aruba, Montego Bay in Jamaica with our new international reservation system. And the network opportunities that we have ahead are very exciting, and we will continue to focus on achieving and sustaining adequate returns on capital. Our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong, and we will continue our diligent efforts to provide adequate returns to our valued shareholders. And although we still have a few months to go before we can claim victory for full year 2014, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed our 15% target, with the exceptional results produced during the first half of the year. And with that overview, Tom, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Tammy, back to the -- on the aircraft. I think you said that you were going to be bringing on what, 17 used 737s. Are those -700s or -800s? Is that a mix? Tammy Romo : It's -700s. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And is that all this year or into next year? Tammy Romo : Yes, the 17 that I gave is all this year. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, great. And then the -- when you talked about next year, I just -- to clarify, the seat count is up 2% to 3%, but then you threw in a point about longer stage length. So I guess, is it -- if we think about it on an ASM basis, it's going to be slightly higher than 2% to 3%? Is that how we should think of it? Tammy Romo : Yes. Mike, we haven't provided our full year ASM outlook. However, we will be publishing our first quarter 2015 schedule in the coming weeks, and that will reflect about a 5% ASM growth year-over-year. And Mike, I know you'll remember this. We had 1.5 points of this growth is -- we're expecting that to be due to, as you recall, first quarter last year, we had -- we were impacted by the -- or actually, first quarter this year, we were impacted by the winter storms. And of course, as you would expect with the sunset of the Wright Amendment, we'll have -- likely have a longer flying out of Love Field and also DCA and likely LaGuardia. So I think that accounts for the difference between the -- kind of the 2% to 3% increase in seats versus the 5% ASM growth that we're expecting in our first -- in our schedule, which will take us through about March. Gary C. Kelly: So again, Mike, that -- the 5% that Tammy's talking about is the estimate for the first quarter. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes, very good. No, that's helpful. And then my second question and this is either for Tammy, you or even Gary. When you look at your sort of -- the booking window for customers, business and leisure, historically, you've been a lot shorter than the rest of the industry. I think the rest of the industry, I think it's 330 days, plus or minus a few. You've historically been, I don't know, 180, maybe you've topped it to that 200, 210. As you move into the newer systems, you move on to the Amadeus Alt\u00e9a system and as you start flying international where people tend to book those, especially on the leisure front, some of those tickets are booked much further in advance. A trip to Jamaica or even down the road if you decide to fly to Hawaii, those are bigger decisions, and they tend to have longer lead times. Do we start to see your booking period extend? Is that in the offing? Would that be part of moving on to this new Amadeus system? Your thoughts on that. Gary C. Kelly: I think there's 2 -- really 2 aspects to answering your question. One is just customer behavior. And you're right, even if we don't change our 180-day -- and your rule of thumb there is right, it's about 6 months out. Even if we don't change that, I suspect that we'll start seeing more bookings out farther on our booking curve. Secondly, with the new reservation system that we're working on, that won't be in place for 2015. And we haven't given a timeline for that yet, Tammy, I don't think. Tammy Romo : We have not. Gary C. Kelly: So really, we'll be -- we don't want to change our current reservation system capabilities, it's not worth it. So it will be a year or more before we'll have the capabilities to realistically extend the bookings. I think there's more to it than just adding the reservation system capability. That's a long time to put a schedule out. And as you know, the rest of the industry goes in and makes changes to it. And we typically have not done that. So that would be somewhat of a policy/procedure change that we would need to think through as well. So we agree with everything you said, that as we go longer and go more international, that there will probably be more demand for bookings further out. And that's something that we'll have the capabilities in the future to choose to do or not. But at this point, I don't think we've made a firm commitment one way or the other. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC: How much of your cost advantage do you attribute to having a single fleet type now that you've acquired and in the process of divesting 717s? Tammy Romo : Hunter, this is -- we know that we have a significant advantage just from a single fleet type. And I guess from the 717s, really the benefit of transitioning from 717s to -- back to a 737 fleet is pretty significant. Now of course, a lot of that is just driven by just the more fuel-efficient 737 fleet. So probably the best gauge I can give you, if your question is on really the 717s versus the 737, are really just the benefits that we provided in our fleet modernization efforts, which is the EBIT. We're expecting that to be in $500 million range here for this year. But clearly, we have the -- we have a clear advantage relative to the rest of the industry. And certainly, a single fleet type is a large -- is a contributor to that. And our advantage is, I think, Hunter, relative to the legacy carriers, our cost advantage is probably 30% to 35%. So I don't have a specific figure to give you here off the top of my head but certainly, it is a -- it's a notable contributor to our low-cost advantage. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, Tammy. And as you think about the -- obviously, a longer stage length next year, and [indiscernible] to give ASM guidance on known seat count guidance and as we think about the increased popularity of the Rapid Rewards program, are you getting pressure from some of your better customers to improve the number of redemption markets and -- one of those being Hawaii? And I know you guys talked about expanding into Hawaii, your analysts, think it was a couple of years ago almost at this point. But how has that thought process evolved? And are the -800s coming ETOPS certified that will enable that to take place next year? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I'm not sure until we follow on your question. So with the Southwest route network, we don't have any restrictions anywhere. And there are -- every seat, every flight, every -- obviously, every destination has access online. And then you've got the opportunity to buy seats offline with our Rapid Rewards program. I think our programs are fantastic. It's the -- by all measures, it is better than the other program. We've got record levels of membership and all the things that I know you know. So in terms of people being dissatisfied with how they can you use their rewards on the Southwest system, no, we don't get that at all. If we ever do choose to serve Hawaii, I'm sure they'll be delighted to have that. But in the meantime, they've got some wonderful Southwest destinations, which, Hunter, one way or the other, they're going to continue to get more attractive as we expand beyond the 48 states. Mike Van De Ven does have some of the -800s equipped with ETOPS. We have work to do to fly to Hawaii, which I doubt we'll be able to keep a secret. So you'll know when we've made that commitment when we decide that. And it will take us not years from start to finish, but it'll take us some time to actually activate that. Hawaii is 1 of 50 potential destinations that we now have created. And it'll just have to compete priority-wise with the other great opportunities that we have. So I've realize your question wasn't specifically about Hawaii. The only thing that I noticed, Tammy, looking at the utilization of the awards, which was interesting to me is that the growth we've seen in the award usage over the past 5-plus years is actually taking place more in short-haul markets. And in the old days, our program was oriented towards rewarding people for flying short, and then they would use the award to fly long. So interestingly enough, the growth in utilization is actually more in the short-haul markets. But I don't think we've got any complaints whatsoever at this point with our new program. It's working very well. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Gary, I just wanted to follow-up on the last thing that you just said, 50 potential destinations out there that you've created. Can you just kind of walk us through the process here for how you're thinking about growth going forward? We've heard other low-cost carriers sort of talk about the rising price umbrella, creating a lot of new growth opportunities. I'm just curious sort of big picture how you arrive at that number and certainly sounds like you're now prospecting for new markets. Gary C. Kelly: Well, we've been working on this, John, for years so there's no surprise with where we are. I think it is simply counting dots that have simply been created by adding the 737-800 and international capabilities, also propelled by the AirTran acquisition that makes these potential destinations available to us. They were not available to us in 2010 was the main point I was trying to illustrate. We won't go add 50 dots to the route map next year. The 50, as I'm describing it to you, they are all beyond the 48 states. So there's nothing new. It's Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America. Those are all within the performance capabilities of the 737. And they all at least look sufficiently attractive when it comes to the traffic potential and filling up the 737. So it's a wonderful place to be, and whether we'll ultimately serve all 50 destinations is not guaranteed or committed to. It's just the fact that those are opportunities, there's a number of them and we'll have to prioritize according to, fundamentally, what's the next best opportunity for traffic and revenue and profits. It'll be a little complicated by the fact that in some cases, we'll need to add capabilities to the aircraft like ETOPS. So that has to be factored in. Or in the case of Mexico, in particular, you have to apply for route authorities, and then we'll have to do that on a strategic and the tactical basis as well. But it's a nice -- as I said in my remarks, it's a wonderful thing, and it's just nice to be able to have a number of opportunities to choose from. John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. That's helpful. I had understood it's 50 in general, but it sounds like you're specifically talking about international opportunities because of the changing capability. Gary C. Kelly: Well, and it -- that's just the way our domestic route map has developed. After the AirTran acquisition, we added 17 more domestic destinations to the Southwest route map. And as you look at the route map, we cover the top 50 with one exception. So the -- we know and you know that our opportunities to add dots or destinations in the 48 states is rather limited. So absolutely, the opportunities to grow in terms of destinations is beyond the 48 states. Now let me quickly clarify that there are numerous opportunities to grow within the 48 states among the destinations that we currently serve, connecting dots, additional frequencies, Wright Amendment and -- or, well, rather Dallas Love Field and Washington Reagan being 2 prominent and easy examples there. But additional thoughts will be beyond the 48 states most likely. John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : That's very helpful. And that's a good segue to my second question, which is I understand sort of the difficulty in talking about ASM growth rates overall when you have so many different moving parts in international growth and so on and so forth. But domestically, over the next few years, what's the right framework for thinking about capacity growth or your willingness to add capacity growth? Gary C. Kelly: I think it's to be determined. I think that we have a real high class problem, which is we have far more places that we would like to serve than we'll have airplanes and we'll make those judgments tactically based on, again, the inputs that I've described to you. But we'll -- one would assume that if we have mature markets that have growth opportunities that, that would probably compete for a top priority spot. But again, there's no reason for us to make that commitment at this point. And we'll just have to manage this in a very measured way year-to-year and with the annual objectives in mind of running a great operation, offering outstanding customer service and hitting our return on invested capital target. And those are going to be the guidepost in determining how we grow and how fast we grow. John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And do you think about that ROIC target for growth differently for international versus domestic, given just different risks? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I think, yes. I mean, in other words, every opportunity is going to have to meet the 15% threshold, and if the risks are higher, well then, they'll have to be factored in. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division : Just on the 717 transition, so what will salaries and training costs look like after this year? And maybe percent change or what percent is from this year's related to the training and so on to move those pilots from the 717s to the 737s? Tammy Romo : Helane, yes, after -- I think it's really after this year. I think we may have some training costs that dribble into next year, but it shouldn't be all that significant. And in terms of just the step-up in the wage rate as we bring our AirTran employees, convert them over to Southwest employees, really all that's remaining there are the, of course, the crews. And -- but that's all been factored into the guidance that we've given you. So really all the employees are already Southwest employees, with the exception of the pilots and flight attendants that we need over on the AirTran side until we bring that flying over to Southwest. Gary C. Kelly: Helane, I probably won't add anything to what Tammy has already said, but just for a little color, and this is a huge shout out to all of our folks in our training departments, flight operations, and then all of the rest of our operating groups, they're doing a phenomenal job. We have record training events occurring in 2014. So in other words, in the first half costs that you already have seen, we have an unusually large amount of training underway. And that will continue through the balance of this year. And I agree with Tammy, by the time you get into 2015, we'll be back more to normal, although I think, Mike [ph], there's probably some front end, maybe 2 months of 2015, where we'll have heavy training events. But the other point to make here is that you have a lot of aircraft and a lot of employees \"out of service\" in 2014 and we're still producing strong results. Well, those airplanes effectively come back into service next year as they get through the conversion. And then our employees, as they get through all the big gulp training that's taking place in 2014, they'll be more productive next year as well. You'll have more -- you'll have a higher percentage of employees at the Southwest pay scale next year, so that will create some inflation. And I'll just refer to Tammy on that. Tammy Romo : Yes. Helane, only other point I just wanted to make on the training, if you're working on your model there, just as a reminder, those training costs are included in the integration costs. And as we said in the earnings release, we're expecting that total cost to be about $550 million. Training is just one component of that, of course. So that's where the training costs, at least, are showing up. Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So the 8% kind of numbers we're looking at in salaries is kind of a true number and doesn't have any of those events in it? Tammy Romo : That is correct. It does include -- as we're converting the AirTran employees over to Southwest, it includes that step up, but it does not include the training costs. Those are included in the integration costs. Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just my follow-up question on an unrelated item. I think you said you opened the schedule and are now starting to take bookings for the Wright Amendment sign, yes, with 88 days to go. Early days here I know, but is there -- can you give us some color on how that's booking and what you're seeing in terms of, I don't know, picking up passengers that may be going on -- that may have been avoiding you, not going on a one-stop basis over some of your other cities? Gary C. Kelly: They look really -- they look very normal, they look very solid. And that's just within the context that the outlook looks real strong. So it all looks good. I think Tammy mentioned in her comments just the second quarter performance of the \"Wright Amendment markets,\" and we saw a very strong increase already, and I suppose a lot of it's just the awareness that's been created about the restrictions coming down and the publishing of the new schedule. But yes, I think we had a 21% increase in the Wright Amendment revenue oriented around Dallas, obviously, in the second quarter. So -- but yes, those markets all look good. There's 15 new nonstop destinations that we'll launch in -- October 13th to early November and we can't wait. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Just continuing on Helane's question there, but specific to fleet. As you think about lower utilization, transitioning aircraft to Delta and from AirTran to Southwest, can you quantify what the headwind to CASM is this year as it relates to fleet transition and lower utilization? Tammy Romo : Duane, I'm just thinking here with you. We would be impacted some on the utilization. I don't know that I can pinpoint a specific number for you as we move forward. But we should see, as we get all of the flying over to Southwest, obviously, an improvement in the utilization, which is also driving some of the ASM improvement or the ASM increase that I mentioned for the first quarter. I'm just trying to think through and reconcile with you what that number might be, but... Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : It just feels like it's a -- it's probably a material component of your CASM growth... Tammy Romo : Yes, I think to your point... Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : May not recur, right? Tammy Romo : Yes. And to your point, we definitely have opportunities, as we look ahead to 2015, to be more efficient with our fleet. And as you can imagine, with the conversion of all the markets in 2014, just from a staffing perspective as well, we're not -- we're clearly not as efficient as we could be going forward as well once we have just more stability in our network. So we haven't given unit cost guidance for next year, but as you can see this year, we're certainly benefiting from the increased gauge, and I would expect in 2015 that we would also get some benefit from just the overall improvement in utilization. But we're still working through our plan and our schedule and all the details for next year. And it will give you a better guidance on that as we get a little bit later in the year and have a little more certainty on our schedule for 2015. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then one for Gary. I mean, when you hit this target, which we've been pointing to for years and you finally realize it this year, what do you do? Do you raise it? I mean, what happens when you hit a sort of long-standing aspirational target? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I think Duane, we do what I said we're going to do, which is we're going to take up every year and have a goal to run an excellent, reliable operation, provide outstanding customer service and have a business and a plan that continues to have consistent profitability, achieving at least a 15% pretax return on invested capital. We've got opportunities to grow the network both domestically and internationally, as we've described. And we'll want to manage that growth very, very carefully so that we sustain all 3 of those performance levels. But we want our return on invested capital to continue to be at least 15%, with 15% as the floor. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Tammy, maybe going back to the Rapid Rewards program kind of in the context of how successful you view that being for you guys, can you just talk a little bit about the growth in the frequent flier liability there? And it's growing at a rate a little bit faster than your peers. I mean, is the plan to manage that a little bit more aggressively in the future? Or are you okay with the growth you're seeing? Tammy Romo : Well, we -- we're constantly evaluating the -- our Rapid Rewards program. And just as a reminder, we did recently increase the coefficient for using a Rapid Rewards flight. And so that's at least keeping the usage in line with what we -- with what our more recent trends have been. But as Gary stated earlier, we've been extremely happy with the Rapid Rewards program. And the -- let's see, the benefits -- the second quarter impact related to our Rapid Rewards program is probably roughly $95 million on a year-over-year basis, $95 million. So we're seeing probably a 40% to 50% increase in our revenue year-over-year. So we're delighted with how that's performing. But to your point, we've obviously got to keep an eye on the liability where we're monitoring the usage. But the overall economics, we're very happy with. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Quick clarification. The cost guidance doesn't contain any accruals, correct, Tammy? Tammy Romo : That is correct. Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And more broadly speaking, and I'm not asking you to negotiate in public here. I'm just curious if there's been any change in the tone of negotiations in light of your very impressive recent results. Gary C. Kelly: Negotiations continue. We've got negotiations with a number of workgroups. And the pace and understandably, the texture of those negotiations is different by workgroup. So it obviously puts the company in a position where it can afford to do certain things. But the main thing that we need to do is to preserve Southwest Airlines' low fare brand and low-cost position competitively. And it doesn't change the need to do that. Our competition is stronger today than it has been in a long time. And so we'll -- that hasn't changed, Jamie, and therefore, it's a great rallying cry for all of our people to work together to beat all of our competitors, so that's -- that work continues. Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Sure. Okay, I appreciate that. And secondly, I know you don't guide on fuel efficiency, but with the amplification 717s going out, 73 is coming in, longer stage lengths, I personally could use an assist. I mean for 2015, would you expect ASMs per gallon to exceed 74? Or is something in the 73 range more likely? Gary C. Kelly: We've got -- and I'll let Tammy think about that while I just make one quick comment here. And we -- and Jamie, I think we can do that. Now we have tried to -- or at least our Investor Relations effort here has tried to give you some guidance with the fleet modernization benefits, which I think, Tammy, are largely fuel efficiency. Tammy Romo : That's correct. Gary C. Kelly: So you do have that. But you're right. It hasn't equated precisely to the consumption number. So -- but yes, we're already realizing significant benefits from the fleet modernization/fuel efficiency. Of course, the fleet modernization with an upgauging benefit, as an example, has -- as you well know, has benefits beyond just fuel burn. But anyway, let me -- do you have a... Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes. And I would definitely agree with that conclusion. I mean, you've punched nicely north of 72 as of the fourth quarter of last year. Tammy Romo : I think directionally, you're in the ballpark, Jamie. I had sort of a 73 in mind. But I think we'll continue to see improvement as we go for all the obvious reasons as we continue to replace the 717s and the classic aircraft with more fuel-efficient airplanes. But we haven't given a number yet for the next year, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it exceed 74. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I know your credit rating is very important to you, and obviously having a strong balance sheet makes a lot of sense. I'm just wondering whether you think your balance sheet is bordering too conservative at this stage with cash and short-term investments hovering north of about 200% of consensus revenue estimates for the year. Tammy Romo : Well, obviously, maintaining a healthy balance sheet obviously has always been a top priority for Southwest. And we really do have a lot -- which really -- it's really a balancing act and we have a lot of guideposts. Of course, one of our goals for this year that we stated is to -- we have an investment grade balance sheet. We would like to notch that up, and so that's obviously one consideration. But as Gary said earlier, we have a lot of high-class problems. Our questions on our hands is -- so really, our overall goal is to enhance shareholder value. I think we'll need to balance our capital expenditures against our desire to continue to enhance capital through our shareholder deployment. So I think -- and I think the other guidepost I would just point you to is just our cash balance, it is $4 billion. Our target is probably closer to $2.5 billion. But keep in mind too, there's some seasonality in that cash balance. And we do have -- as I mentioned earlier, we've got over $400 million in debt due later this year. So of course, with the peak second quarter, we're kind of -- we've got higher cash balances and seasonally, that's typically the case. So that's just another factor. So we're looking ahead at what our needs are and with the overall goal in mind to enhance shareholder value through either deploying capital back to our shareholders. And also as Gary mentioned, we want to continue to grow the airline. Gary C. Kelly: Just trying to be real quick with you here. I think if I just take your questions literally, is it too conservative? I would say no, it's not too conservative. Is it too aggressive? No. So is it the exact right spot? I don't know that I'm ready to answer that quite yet. So we continue to -- as you know, the rating agencies don't just look at leverage. In fact, interestingly enough, they don't look at leverage much at all. And that's the way we normally casually talk about it. So there's other things that they look at and we'll want to continue to work with them in an effort to try to improve the credit rating. I think that, that would be better than being so close to junk. On the other hand, if trends continue for several years like they have been for the last couple, that the balance sheet's going to continue to show less and less leverage. And yes, it is possible when it gets to a point where we think that it's \"too conservative,\" but I don't feel that we're there right now. And like Tammy, said I think that's a high-class problem and something ultimately can be managed. The only other thing that I think needs to be mentioned here is that we've lived through a brutal decade where every balance sheet in the industry was stressed and most went bankrupt. So you just can't extrapolate 2014 into infinity. And we do want to make sure that we err on this side financially of being conservative and being very well prepared for the unpredictable. And the unpredictable's happened a lot to us in 43 years. But again, it's not say that we're worried. We're not. We're feeling very confident, very good and very pleased with this quarter and very pleased with our outlook. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I definitely appreciate all of that. If I could just ask a separate question, Gary, on your international expansion. Can you help us understand your thought process behind building depth versus breadth in your network? And then sort of a separate question related to the international side. Obviously, we appreciate that your fleet will have much longer range. But I'm curious as to how your unit cost advantage or competitiveness changes when you start competing against your network peers that are going to be flying larger gauge fleet. Gary C. Kelly: Excellent questions and questions that again sort of put in that high-class problem category. Well, we're going to have to choose, and I suppose that the choices will, from time -- from one decision point to the next will probably have different priorities, things will just change. We want to do both. We certainly want to increase the diversity and the breadth of our route system. But we have opportunities that we haven't seen in quite some time to also improve the depth in a lot of our markets. And those are the exact conversations and debates that our commercial experts are having right now. I'd rather not tip our hand as to exactly what we might do. But again, just to put it in perspective for everyone, international right now is 1% of Southwest route system. So it is a very, very small component, and it's going to be small for a long time. So I think that may very well help direct us in the future as to how we think about additional flights from one schedule to the next. But 50 dots on the route map obviously is a great opportunity to increase the breadth. And again, all this has to fit in with hitting our return requirements. I think by definition, increasing the depth, one would think would be less risk as opposed to increasing the size of the route network. So all that will have to be factored in as well. So we've got a great opportunity to grow, grow the earnings and continue as we grow the capital base, along with the growth in earnings to hit our 15% minimum target. And it's very exciting and we've got opportunities to do both. So that's, again, a very high-quality problem. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I appreciate it's late in the call. I mean, do you care to comment on -- just a last question about unit cost competitiveness over the longer haul? Or is it just... Gary C. Kelly: I'm sorry. Yes, I didn't skip it on purpose. I'd forgotten to answer the question. Well, I think, yes, as you go longer, it gives us less ability to bring our strength, which is efficiency and turning airplanes. It makes a little bit harder to bring that competitively to the market. So that will have to be factored in. I don't know that we are well prepared for \"ultra long-haul flying\". But we feel we have a very solid cost advantage with the 737 and in the route network that we're envisioning to, again, North America and the northern part of South America. So I think that, that holds true at least with the analysis that we've done. And that's been the case over a number of years. We want to continue being the low-cost producer and work hard to achieve that position and then maintain it, and certainly, we want to be known as the low-fare brand and that we're going to work hard to sustain that as well. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom. And thanks again to everyone for joining our call today. As always, I'll be available this afternoon if you have any additional questions. Thanks again. Operator : . Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Ginger Hardage, Senior Vice President, Culture and Communications. Ginger C. Hardage: Great. Thank you, Tom. And we would like to welcome all the members of the news media who might have questions for Tammy and Gary. So I think Tom's going to give instructions and we'll get that started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Mike Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : I noticed that you announced earlier that you're going to purchase 17 preowned 737s. I noted as I was on the call earlier with United folks and they announced a kind of a new strategy for them to buy used, and certainly Delta is kind of well-known for pursuing that strategy. I wonder if you could just talk about used planes and -- as a strategy and kind of what's going on with that? Gary C. Kelly: Well, sure. We -- for us, it's not new either. I think we used the preowned market historically for more tactical growth opportunities. And we were very active in the 1990s, in particular, going out into the used market, finding good airplanes and have the capability of quickly converting them to the Southwest livery, and putting them into revenue service. That is a -- when the market is available, that is a very good strategy. And in particular, it works well for us right now. So what is unique for Southwest is that we're an all-737 carrier. We are the launch customer for the 737 MAX, which is coming online in 2017. And it -- all the indications are it will be a vastly superior aircraft from an economic perspective. So if our Chief Operating Officer had is druthers, he'd rather be getting those airplanes new right now as opposed to the current generation. So a wonderful way to bridge the gap is to go into the used market rather than buying the current generation new from Boeing, understanding that we'll be using them for a shorter period of time, but that just means that we'll get the 737 MAX that much faster again compared to buying an airplane here in 2014 and keeping it for 30 years. That all works great, that's a great strategy, but the airplanes have to be available. And it just so happens that there are a lot of 737-700s on the used markets at attractive prices that are available. If they are not, then I'm sure we wouldn't continue to pursue that strategy. So everything has to come together. We love the 737-700, which is the NG product. That's what Mike is picking up and economics are fantastic, so I think that works very well. So it's not necessarily a new strategy for us. The circumstances are different this time that caused us to pursue that. But it definitely helps us manage our capital spending at a time where we would like to not only replace retiring equipment, but also begin to pick up new units to grow. So all way around, I think it's a great strategy and something that's working very well for us. Michael Sasso : And so a quick follow-up. You said there are a lot of 737-700s on the market. Why is that right now? Gary C. Kelly: Mike, you want to speak to that? Michael G. Van De Ven : Yes, Mike, it's just a function of them rolling off lessors' order leasing books. So they typically lease the airplane out anywhere from 8, 10, 12, up to 20 years. And they roll into the marketplace, and we just have a bow [ph] wave of them rolling in the market place over the next couple of years. Gary C. Kelly: And we're the largest 737-700 operator in the world, and it's an airplane that we really like. And it could be that other airlines are pursuing other aircraft types. It's often hard to know, but we like that airplane and for whatever reasons, there's a lot of them. And that was Mike Van De Ven, our COO by the way, that was answering that question. Tammy Romo : And just one thing to add. The lessors love to lease the Southwest Airlines because we do have a very strong balance sheet. Gary C. Kelly: Yes, you heard the question earlier about our credit rating, and Tammy makes an outstanding point. Yes, which we are a preferred customer for anybody who wants to get paid. Tammy Romo : That is correct. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Doug Cameron : This is one for Gary or maybe Ron. Going back to the international expansion, guys, I see you've been sort of active in some DOT dockets with regard to potential Mexico flights, which kind of makes me think, I wonder if any of the international expansion in that region is kind of dependent on any regulatory changes, be it either bilateral or whether there's kind of plentiful opportunities for you with the status quo as far as current air service agreements are concerned. Gary C. Kelly: Ron Ricks, our EVP and Chief Regulatory and Legal Officer, will step up to the microphone here. Ron Ricks : I think the only new development there that might merit some attention is that the United States and Mexico are discussing a new bilateral. And what we're hearing is that for the first time in quite some time -- by the way, I don't think the treaty between the 2 countries has been renegotiated since the early 1960s. But for the first time since then, Mexico is interested in liberalizing that treaty, liberalizing this context, meaning more opportunities for more flights by U.S. carriers. That is a goal that we support, and it's something we're urging the United States government to pursue in the negotiations in hopes that we can achieve a new bilateral sooner rather than later, which means expanded opportunities for us. Doug Cameron : [Indiscernible] there are only 2 or 3 designations. Now, Ron, you're confident you could get one of those if and when you decide to fly from Hobby or any other points? Ron Ricks : There are a number -- if I understand your question, there are a number of routes that we're interested in pursuing over the short-term and there are opportunities. But the point of the new bilateral negotiations is to expand that list more and -- so that we can have more opportunity. But I think regardless of whether there's a new treaty or not, to Gary's earlier commentary, there are plenty of opportunities for us, again a high-class problem. There are lots of places we can go, so we don't think we'll be route-restricted, if that's a concern. But on the other hand, Mexico is a very attractive place for us to fly our existing route structure in the demographics of the United States today. And if there are more opportunities in Mexico, then I'm sure Mr. Andrew Watterson and his team and our network planning group would be happy to pursue them. Gary C. Kelly: And Doug, the other thing -- so Ron is acknowledging -- we're acknowledging that there may be some city pair routes that we can't get the route authority to fly. We know that. But the thing that is different about Southwest Airlines is we have dozens of cities that we have point-to-point networks that originate from. So we have routes into Mexico right now from Orange County, California; Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas as an example. So we -- Houston may not be open to us to certain Mexican cities, but I'll bet we can find other spots on the Southwest system that are. But in any event, we have 50 potential beyond 48 state destinations. And if we can't go one place, we'll have ample opportunities to go somewhere else. And as a practical matter, we simply cannot satisfy all the growth opportunities at the same time anyway. So it will help prioritize if we're restricted. But clearly, we're in support. And Ron made this clear, we're in support of liberalizing the bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico and that will bring more competition. That will lower fares, it will be better for consumers. So it's not just about us selfishly. It's really what's good for consumers. Operator : Our question comes from David Koenig with the Associated Press. David Koenig : I will make it easy, an easy one here. Gary, I know that -- I see that the release does talk about a 3% present [ph] gain expected in July over last July. Anything else you can say about demand in the third quarter and bookings? And part of that is how soon do you expect it's going to be into everybody starts dumping a bunch of extra capacity into the system? Gary C. Kelly: Well, I think that capacity -- just go backwards with your question. I think the supply side of this is generally a longer cycle. So, I mean, if you just look at us, if we wanted to add more flights next month, we just -- we couldn't do it. That's a fairly long lead time that's required to require equipment, hire and train employees, et cetera. So right now, the demand is very strong and it is balanced very nicely with the supply of seats. We're going to manage our growth very carefully so that we don't upset that balance for Southwest Airlines. And what the rest of the industry does, of course, I can't speak to. I think David, the bigger risk, personally, is the economy and fuel prices. With all the turmoil there is in the Middle East, things could change quite rapidly, and I'm much more concerned about that. The demand side things, if you will, are continuing to be stable and strong as opposed to a radical change in the supply side anytime soon. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Hardage for any additional or closing remarks. Ginger C. Hardage: Well, great. Thank you so much for your interest today. We know there's a lot of news going on in the industry but thank you for tuning into us. If you have any additional questions, our communications team, that number is (214) 792-4847. Thank you so much. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining.",

My name is Tom and I\u2019ll be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on the southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Marcy Brand :  Thank you Tom, good morning everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s call to discuss our third quarter results. Joining me on the call is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance, and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, and President of AirTran Airways. We will begin with opening remarks from Gary followed by Tammy providing a review of our results and our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy\u2019s remarks. Please be advised that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company\u2019s current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please refer to this morning\u2019s press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary C. Kelly:  Thank you Marcy and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. I know it\u2019s a busy day for you all and glad you all can join us. I\u2019m very pleased with our financial results. I\u2019m very proud of our people, especially. Third quarter is a very busy season. Our people work hard every single day to sever our customers with safe, reliable, friendly, and low-cost air travel and sometimes under very challenging circumstances. So these results really were a testament to their very hard work. The transformative changes with a new rapid rewards program, the acquisition and integration of AirTran, the addition of the 737-800 model, and our fleet modernization program have also been very hard work. And again, my profound things to our people for working through those changes so magnificently and the stellar results, of course, are very obvious. One historic milestone achieved in third quarter was the launch of international service on July 1st. We talked about that in the second quarter earnings call in late July. And I\u2019ll just say again it was flawless. I\u2019m very proud of our people again for their hard work in what is a very exciting achievement. The customer and operational aspects of our international launch have been stellar. From a business or commercial perspective, our international results are in line with our expectations. I will admit to you all they are a drag on our results. Right now, we\u2019ve got some work to do. And accordingly, our international footprint is quite modest. It\u2019s about 1% of our capacity. And also just, we\u2019d remind everyone that our growth plans in 2015 for international are modest as well. So we plan to manage our near-term \u2013 our near international expansion very carefully and very closely, but again that said, we\u2019re pleased with current status. We plan to open Costa Rica in March, as well as a handful of other destinations next year all with low frequency. Another historic third quarter event was the unveiling of our new Heart livery along with our new Heart branding and logo, the same Heart, but a new look. It\u2019s a tribute to our employees, who are the best in the business. It signifies that as of 2014 Southwest has exciting new capabilities and exciting new opportunities and unlike the Southwest before. In typical Southwest fashion, we\u2019ll rollout the refresh livery and branding in a cost neutral manner during the normal maintenance cycle or out of our discretionary marketing budget. Since the end of the quarter, the long anticipated repeal of the Wright Amendment happened, the long anticipated Southwest effect happened too. And on October 13, we added seven new non-stop destinations, 22 more daily departures to Dallas Love Field that was the largest single day expansion in our history. And load factors so far have been in excess of 90% on these 22 new flights. So I\u2019m going to talk to Bob Jordan about the few empty seats that he has later. Eight more destinations are coming November 2nd, and I expect that they will do equally well. Also in November, we will finish adding flights using the DCA slots that we bought from American Airlines. We began adding service to DCA with the new slots back in August, where we went from 17 daily departures with seven non-stop destinations up to, in November we\u2019ll be 44 daily departures and double the destinations, or 14. And I\u2019d just remind everybody that\u2019s not a net capacity increase to the industry; it is obviously a significant capacity increase for Southwest. And I expect that we\u2019re going to do quite well there as well. So no surprise, those two city initiatives will drive our year-over-year capacity growth in fourth quarter and in 2015, our international growth will be very modest especially considering that Houston doesn\u2019t open until late next year. And finally before I turn it over to Tammy, I wanted to thank the IAM leadership for the tentative agreement that was announced yesterday and especially I want to congratulate our customer service and consumer support and services employees, who represented by the IAM. I\u2019m delighted for them. I\u2019m very pleased that we can reward our people even more for their hard work and also that they can share in the success now of a record year along with our non-contract frontline and supervisory employees. So, of course, the TA is subject to ratification by the IAM membership and I hope that there will be more TAs that will follow quickly. With that very brief overview, I would like to turn it over to Tammy Romo, who will take us through the financial results of the third quarter. Tammy Romo :  All right, thank you Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased to report another terrific quarter this morning again breaking many records. Net income, excluding special items, was a record $382 million, or $0.55 per share, which increased approximately 60% over last year. Our third quarter GAAP net income was also a record $329 million. Operating income was also a third quarter record at $649 million and we expanded our operating margin by almost 400 basis points to 13.5%. Our pre-tax to return on invested capital for the twelve months ended September 30was 19%, which on an after-tax basis was 12%, well exceeding our weighted average cost of capital. These strong results were driven by record revenues, lower fuel prices, our ongoing cost control efforts, and represents our sixth consecutive quarter on record profitability. For the nine months ended September 30, our profits have resulted in $256 million in profit sharing expense, which already exceeds full-year 2013\u2019s contribution to the plans. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our people and I congratulate and thank them for their hard work. Our third quarter revenues reached record levels increasing 5.6% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenues of $4.6 billion. Strong demand for travel resulted in record traffic and load factors despite 4% fewer trips and 2% fewer seats flown year-over-year. We also had a double-digit growth in corporate sales and our strong initiatives continue to significantly contribute to strong revenue momentum. On a unit basis, total operating revenues increased 4.5% compared to third quarter last year on a 1% increase in available seat miles. Passenger unit revenues increased almost 5% compared to third quarter last year with strong unit revenue improvement each month of the quarter. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, our markets under development is significantly higher than historical levels as we worked to complete the integration of AirTran. In the third quarter, we had approximately 15% of our third quarter available seat miles under development. Our international markets, as Gary commented on continued to offset ramp up nicely and are performing in line with our expectations. As we move into fourth quarter, the demand environment remains solid and strong revenue trends revenue trends have continued. We have not seen any noticeable negative impact on demand from Ebola or macroeconomic news. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we expect October PRASM to up roughly 2% year-over-year. Bookings for November and December are also good. Looking ahead, we expect unit revenue trends to be choppy through the remainder of the quarter due to last year\u2019s comparisons. December\u2019s in particular would be difficult given last year\u2019s as strong increase. In particular, Thanksgiving at Monday return traffic will benefit November this year as opposed to December last year. Moving to freight and other revenues, our freight revenues grew nearly 10% year-over-year, as we continued to expand cargo service, and with the integration of our AirTran network. And we currently expect fourth quarter freight revenues to be comparable to third quarter 2014. Other revenues decreased at 3.5% year-over-year are largely due to AirTran fees continuing to decline with the transition of the AirTran network over to Southwest. EarlyBird revenue performance continues to be strong, and were $59 million in the quarter. And other ancillary revenues were also $48 million. We currently expect fourth quarter 2014 other revenues to decrease year-over-year, likely at a greater year-over-year rate than we experienced in the third quarter due to the ongoing conversion of the AirTran network. Turning now to costs, we had a solid cost performance. Our third quarter unit costs excluding a special items for comparable on a year-over-year basis. And we\u2019re continuing to benefit, as Gary mentioned, from our fleet modernization and other cost control efforts, as well as lower fuel costs. Our third quarter economic jet fuel price per gallon declined 3.9% year-over-year to $2.94, which reflect a $0.05 hedging gain. Fuel prices have plunged even further here in October, reaching levels we haven\u2019t seen for four years, primarily driven by heavy oversupply crude based on our hedge position and market prices and as of Friday, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.70 and $2.75 range. This is right in line with un-hedged prices, and significantly below fourth quarter last year\u2019s $3 05 per gallon. Excluding special items and fuel and oil expense, our unit costs increased 2.6% year-over-year, largely driven by the 45% increase in profit sharing, which of course we like to see. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs increased 1.5% year-over-year as expected. Based on current cost trends, we expect fourth quarter and full year 2014 unit costs, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 2% range. And this guidance contemplates the ratification of the tentative agreement that was announced yesterday with our customer service agents and customer representatives. Moving to our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we ended third quarter 2014 with $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. As a result of our strong free cash flow generation of $1.4 billion this year, we have returned $893 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of $755 million of stocks and the distribution of $138 million in dividends. Over the past three years, we have returned a meaningful $2.1 billion to our shareholders. In third quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased $200 million in shares under an accelerated stock repurchase programs and distributed $41 million in dividend payments. We have $580 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Thus far this year, we have also made $517 million in debt payments including $48 million paid during the quarter and an additional $315 million made in early October. We intend to repay an additional $40 million in scheduled debt and capital lease payments in the reminder of this year. Our leverage including off-balance sheet aircraft leases was 36% as of September 30 and we continue to prudently manage our CapEx spend. Our 2014 capital spending forecast remains at $1.8 billion and we currently expect our 2015 CapEx to be less than this year\u2019s spend. And that brings me to the fleet. I\u2019ll refer you to our press release for our third quarter activity, but here is a quick recap of our full-year 2014 fleet plans. We plan to take delivery of 33 - 800s from Boeing and 23 pre-owned \u2013 700s. On the retirement side, we have retired three classics thus far this year and currently plan to retire our three more by the end of the year for a total of six retirements this year. We have removed 51 of the AirTran 717s from service. The remaining 37 will be removed from service by the end of this year. As of the end of the third quarter, we have transitioned 45 717s to Delta and currently plan to transition 7 more this year. In addition, thus far, we have transitioned 34 of the 52 AirTran-700s to Southwest, which leaves 18-700 aircraft remaining. We continued to manage our fleet plans to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015, with a baseline of roughly 695 aircraft, which was our combined fleet at the time of the AirTran acquisition. We expect our fourth quarter 2014 ASMs to increase year-over-year in 2% to 3% range and full year 2014 ASMs to be less than 1% year-over-year. To close, we are thrilled with our third quarter results. Our outstanding employees continue to give their very best, and I would to like to congratulate them on another record quarterly performance. The revenue momentum in the third quarter has continued thus far into fourth quarter. Our cost control efforts are working as planned. And we will continue to focus on maintaining our low-cost leadership position. Our strategic initiatives have all come together quite well, and puts us in a great position to take advantage of recent opportunities such as Dallas Love Field, Washington Reagan National, New York LaGuardia, and our most recent announcement of our first international destination to Central America. We are excited about our future, and our financial position remains strong as ever, allowing us to deliver on our plans to aggressively manage our invested capital and return strong returns and significant value to our shareholders. And with that, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We are now beginning with our first question, I\u2019m sorry the question-and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) And thank you for waiting. We will now begin with our first question from Hunter Kaey, with Wolf Research. Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Hi, thank you, everybody. How are you? Gary C. Kelly: Looks good. Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Good. Have you seen any improvements or an improved ability to revenue manage after changing the no-show policy? I know it\u2019s a small percentage of your customers that are impacted by that, but in those specific markets or those specific customers that were impacted by it, maybe it was more magnified in certain business markets at certain times of day or something like that. Have you found an improved ability to manage yields around tightening of the restrictions a little bit? Gary C. Kelly:  Well, it\u2019s probably a little early to tell. I think it\u2019s probably nuanced. It\u2019s definitely helped us to identify empty seats and we\u2019re having one or things to happen either the cancellations are happening in advance where we can resell the seats or that money is being forfeited. So it\u2019s sort of the worst to both worlds would be if the customer cancelled at a very last minute where we can\u2019t do anything about it and we go ahead and get the money back, but the revenue management over \u2013 Hunter, I can\u2019t recall how you\u2019ve been following us or the industry, but if you go back 30 years, we had over bookings that was substantially higher than what we have today. Today, the bookings that we would take for departure are very close to the number of seats that we have. So I can\u2019t honestly say that we\u2019ve seen with precision any additional improvement on that, there is bound to be some in there, but it will probably take us a little bit more time to see that. But the benefits are there, the revenue management right now is already very good in terms of the bookings versus the book load factor. This obviously will help, but I guess to give you an honest answer, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve seen anything, any evidence of that so far. Tammy have you? Tammy Romo :  The only thing I would add, Gary, is that we could see a nice benefit here just on the no show here in the third quarter, it was about close to $25 million here in the third quarter, but it is meaningful. Gary C. Kelly:  Yes, it\u2019s meaningful. That\u2019s more than what we get from our upgraded boarding product on a quarterly basis as a reference point. Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research :  Yes. That\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve not been covering you for 30 years, but I think maybe Jamie Baker has that... Gary C. Kelly: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that older, are you? Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research : I don\u2019t. Believe it or not, I am over 30, but that\u2019s nice of you. So, one other question on labor, Gary. Can you tell me what is important to you with a new pilot deal? And I am not asking you where you guys are far apart or where you\u2019re close together. That\u2019s a completely different question. But what\u2019s important to you, Gary, as you sit down and negotiate with labor? Is it more healthcare contribution? Is it productivity? Can you talk to me about what you value out of the next CBA from the pilots? Gary C. Kelly:  Well, I wouldn\u2019t saying were pilots. We\u2019re\u2026 Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research :  Of course not, but I\u2019m just referring to the pilots. Robert E. Jordan: With a number of workgroups and all of them are important. I think the themes are consistent across which is Southwest has a very rich history, very meaningful purpose and we want to sustain that for the next generation. And that is we want to offer our customers great service at a low cost. And that\u2019s what I want to work together with our union leaders to make sure that we sustain going forward. As you well know we have more low cost competition today than ever before in our history and we can\u2019t claim the lowest cost although we are really close, we still can\u2019t that. And I think that\u2019s something that we need to continue to strive for. So that\u2019s number one, that is an important objective, because taking care of Southwest Airline and sustaining our brand really is taking care of our people. So to further taking care of our people we have some wonderful opportunities where we can reward them further just like I described with the tentative agreement we have with the IAM. That\u2019s what we want to achieve with these one of our work groups, do more for our people and find ways to strengthen Southwest Airlines by eliminating waste, improving our productivity, improving our efficiencies. And the nice thing is there are opportunities in every single work group to do to. Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question form Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. What percentage of routes are under development if you exclude the AirTran routes you are taking over? Gary C. Kelly: I don\u2019t know if I can do that. The way we think about the percentage of routes in development I would say it\u2019s about 15%. And I know Bob Jordan and his team have plans \u2013 already committed plans from next year, to grow that further. I think we get close to 20%, don\u2019t we, Bob? Robert E. Jordan: Yes we do. Gary C. Kelly: So that\u2019s more than we\u2019d like, but it is directly tied to the AirTran acquisition and integration. In other words, absent that we wouldn\u2019t have anywhere near that number of new markets, as a component of our system. So I don\u2019t know that I can really piece it apart. Bob, do you have a different way of thinking about that. Robert E. Jordan: No. The other thing that I think is important to point out is we are counting everything new is new. So, if you look at Love Field, even though we served these long-haul destinations through connections, now that we have new non-stops, those are counted as new markets. And when you think about that 15% grown to 20% as well. Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Robert E. Jordan: And it takes a year or two for those to develop, even though we do expect a market like Dallas to mature much faster. So I would say where we are with the AirTran is probably split pretty even, the AirTran markets that are being converted and in these new markets like DCA and Dallas. Gary C. Kelly: And, again, we\u2019ve tried to be as transparent with those as possible. But even if you take a city like Flint, Michigan, it was converted from AirTran to Southwest, the routes that we fly \u2013 Memphis is probably the same example. The routes we fly to those cities are entirely different than what AirTran was flying before. There are some cases where we take a route that AirTran was flying, change the sign and make it Southwest. And one could imagine that that\u2019s less risk than what I described with the Flint scenario, but you\u2019ve got every flavor of all that going on. And I guess just, finally, just to wrap up the answer, the AirTran route system or what was previously AirTran capacity converted to Southwest, what that looks like today compared to when we bought AirTran is very different. We\u2019ve closed 18 AirTran cities. We\u2019ve opened 51 or converted \u2013 either opened or converted 51 of AirTran cities, but you can just envision that that\u2019s a pretty different route system today compared to where they were in 2011. Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That\u2019s helpful. And just looking at 2015, I understand not a lot of the capacity is going to be international. What level of capacity growth, have you massaged that number more as we look at 2015 that you will be adding to the domestic market? Gary C. Kelly: We have and our focus will be on that question when we have our Investor Meeting next month. Today we\u2019re going to focus on the third and the fourth quarter, of course, but, yes we\u2019re working on finalizing our plans for 2015 as we speak. Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I\u2019ll wait for that then. Maybe just, since I didn\u2019t get an answer to that, may I ask? So once you do start flying out of Houston, what could you grow your international capacity at? Gary C. Kelly: Well, Bob and I were talking earlier this morning our initial launch out of Houston. If you just look at \u2013 think about fourth quarter 2015, the capacity increased compared to fourth quarter 2014, assuming that Houston international is open all quarter will be very modest. So we\u2019ll have just a handful of flights. It will not generate a significant amount of growth coming out of Houston international. It sounds like 1% or less. What is known is that the terminal will have five gates, and it\u2019s estimated that the capacity of the five gates will be 25 daily departures. So I think it remains to be seen whether that\u2019s the cap or whether we will be able to do more departures than that. And we will have four of those five gates under lease. So that at least gives you some idea what the potential is out of Houston. Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company:  Hi, thank you for taking my question. Tammy, when you pointed out the fuel volatility in a historical context, I couldn\u2019t help but remember maybe some of the problems that airlines found themselves in when they were hedging and they had to put up cash collateral. I know that you have a lot of disclosures on this. They\u2019re a bit complicated, but there are a bunch of disclosures in the K and the Q. I was hoping that you could maybe boil it down to a simple thought. Does the fuel volatility that we\u2019ve seen to date create any cash collateral issues for you? Tammy Romo : Nothing that we really couldn\u2019t manage, we really shored up our any liquidity, our risk, with our aircraft collateral facility. And we currently have the full $1.2 billion in aircraft collateral available, should prices fall further. At least so far the any cash collateral that we have had to post has been very manageable. John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then if we could talk a little bit about capital returns to shareholders. You obviously have a great leverage ratio versus peers. And a lot of airlines are now comping themselves to high quality industrials. Perhaps you have been comped to that group much longer than others. I just wonder, when are we reaching a point where we can perhaps commit to the marketplace that the vast majority of incremental free cash flow would be used for shareholder returns, buy backs, or what have you? Tammy Romo : As you already said, we really have led the industry in shareholder returns, and certainly this year. We\u2019re very proud of what we have deployed back to our shareholders. In terms of how we intend to deploy our capital going forward, we\u2019ll certainly touch on our 2015 plan when we meet with you all in a couple of weeks. But certainly as the free cash flow levels that we have been enjoying, and our very, I think, manageable CapEx are requirements. Certainly our goal would be to continue to reward our shareholders through continued deployment of cash back to our shareholders. Gary C. Kelly: The only thing that I would add is I think all I\u2019m trying to do is respond to your desire to get more commitment from the company. So I think the scenario would be as long as we are continuing to hit our return on invested capital minimum target and especially in an environment where earnings are growing. The way that I would answer your question is through the dividend. And I don\u2019t think that our dividend is fully matured, I think there are opportunities to grow it. I am not in anyways suggesting that there is a commitment from us that we will grow it. I am just saying that there are opportunities to consider that in the future. And that is \u2013 that clearly is an opportunity for us and obviously you all have seen a very serious commitment by us to increase it over the past three years. The share repurchases \u2013 I would just say by design and by definition are intended to give the company more flexibility and what\u2019s going on in the world with fuel prices right now, a perfect example of that. The volatility is working in our direction. One of these days the volatility won\u2019t work in our direction. So I think you understand that we have to make commitments wisely in this business. John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company: And as a philosophy, is there any reason why leverage needs to fall further? Tammy Romo : Leverage no, not particularly. We\u2019re comfortable with where our leverage sits today. We just actually on October 1st, we repaid $350 million in debt and certainly we\u2019re likely refinanced at least a portion of that at some point in the future. And just one other note, back to just Gary\u2019s comment on the dividend \u2013 because we do get questions on that, I just remind you that we have had very substantial increases in our dividends at our last two annual shareholder meetings. And at the time we increased those dividends, the yield was 1% to 1.2%, so just wanted to remind you of that. Gary C. Kelly: Yes, the darn stocks gone up so much, it dropped the yield\u2026 John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company: It\u2019s a high-quality problem. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse, LLC: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. ROXE continues to show very nice improvement. Is there anything you can share on how you are thinking about a new target? Or is that something we should stay tuned for the investor day? Tammy Romo :  Yes, we\u2019ll dive into that. We are working on our plan for next year as we speak and we\u2019re looking forward to diving into that topic more when we meet here in a few weeks. But, again, our target is at least 15% and we\u2019ll talk to you more about next year\u2019s plans when we meet. Gary C. Kelly:  And I would certainly echo 100% of what Tammy said. We\u2019re always interested to hear feedback from you all as to your views. So we\u2019re going to do more work between now and then and we\u2019ve been giving it considerable thought. I know you\u2019ll be glad to hear this. There is no thought that we would lower the target. I think all we\u2019re talking about is now, since we\u2019re in an environment where we are exceeding the minimum threshold, can we give you all some more precise guidance there. And we will be ready for that conversation in November. Tammy Romo :  And also just want to point out, too, obviously what we\u2019re focused on when we\u2019re setting our targets is our cost to capital clearly, and our cost to capital has averaged between 7% to 8% for a long of period. So certainly with a 19% return on invested capital, we are well exceeding our cost to capital and I\u2019m very pleased with that performance. Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse, LLC:  Yes. Okay. And then a clarification on the commentary. Tammy Romo, you said choppy revenue trends in the fourth quarter and I imagine you just mean because of the comps and the shift in the timing of Thanksgiving. But I just wanted to clarify if there\u2019s any other dynamics that we should be thinking about for the fourth quarter. Tammy Romo :  That\u2019s primarily what I was referring to. Just as a reminder our trends for last year, if you go back to fourth quarter 2013, October was up compared to 2012 by roughly 2%. November was down about 5% and December was up 16% on a year-over-year basis. And, of course that was in part due to the timing of the holiday. So it\u2019s, to your point, very choppy. But if you look at what we\u2019re also focused on is our sequential trend and at least sequentially we\u2019re not really seeing anything on in our trends. So at this point our outlook for the fourth quarter is good. Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, just a follow-up on John\u2019s call about some of the counterparty positions. This is to you, Tammy. I think at the end of the June quarter you were just over $100 million that you had held from counterparties. And then just given the decline in fuel, do you have an estimate of what that swing is? Because you did mention that, I think you suggested that you are now posting with counterparties? And I am just asking so we can see how it impacted cash from quarter-to-quarter? Tammy Romo : Sure. The market value of our fuel hedge portfolio at September 30 was a net asset of $53 million. So we did not have any collateral posted at that time. And as of Friday, the market value of our hedge portfolio was a net liability of $236 million, and we had approximately $100 million in cash collateral posted. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Okay, that\u2019s good then. And so it sounds, Gary C. Kelly: And Michael, while Tammy was talking I was flipping through the press release. And if you look at the cash flow statement you do see that flip. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Okay. Gary C. Kelly: Even as of the end of the quarter, there is a $98 million cash outflow. Tammy Romo : Yeah. Gary C. Kelly: On that cash collateral received or paid to derivative counterparties. So yeah, I mean it has its plusses and minuses, but it\u2019s all very manageable. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Yes, and it\u2019s nothing like the $1 billion-plus, maybe, that we saw back in 2008, 2009, where I think, you have now come up with a structure where you can use a letter of credit or aircraft. It\u2019s de minimis relative to what we saw a few years back. Gary C. Kelly: Yeah. And it was on $1 billion then, but it was a bigger number, there is no doubt about it. So I think, we\u2019ve learned and\u2026 Tammy Romo : Yes. Mike, we are\u2026 Gary C. Kelly: We\u2019ve got a really strong position. Tammy Romo : We\u2019re in good. I think we\u2019re in good shape there. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Yeah, I apologize for the hyperbole. And just one other quick one here. I know you\u2019ve talked about the international service from Houston in the latter part of the year 2015. I did, it does look like you loaded a Houston-Aruba service starting this March. And when I saw that I thought, okay, the terminal is ready. Is that just taking advantage of a pre-clearance facility in Aruba? What\u2019s\u2026 Gary C. Kelly: That\u2019s it. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Okay, all right, perfect. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.: Thanks very much, operator. Hi guys, thank you for the time. Tammy Romo : Hi, Helane. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.: Hi. So here is one of my questions. With respect to your schedule adjustment that you did in August in an effort to improve on time performance because I guess when you were doing 10-minute turns your aircraft were a whole lot smaller so you were carrying fewer people relative to what you are doing now. Can you talk about how that\u2019s improved your overall operations and where you stand relative to your goals for improving on time? Thanks. Gary C. Kelly: But we\u2019ve had a little over 60 days I guess with the, quote, new schedule, and I would say that is performing exactly as intended. We will need a little bit more experience to decide whether it needs more turning, but at times we\u2019ve had some unusual spring like weather. We had the fire at the Chicago tower which disrupted our on-time performance because of a disruption in the operation. The tower is up and running since the October 13, the on-time performance and the weather has been pretty good and the on-time performance has been superb. So we\u2019ve had very strong load factors this month and very strong on-time performance. So I am very happy now Mike Van De Ven already to add I don\u2019t know if I would call it insurance, but more operational recoverability with our April schedule. So he is going to getting more help there from a scheduling perspective i.e., you will have more airplanes to recover with. Just to make sure that we get out of a pace of hopefully somewhere in the 83% to plus 85% range and then we\u2019ll tune it from there, but I am very pleased with it and its working I think Mike pretty much as designed. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.: Okay, great. And then I just have one follow-up question. Somebody asked me this yesterday and I didn\u2019t really have a good \u2013 I didn\u2019t have any answer. The question was when will you announce service to Hawaii? Gary C. Kelly: We know why you didn\u2019t have an answer to that question because you don\u2019t know. And you know what, neither do I. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.: That\u2019s certainly fair. Thank you. See you in a few weeks. Gary C. Kelly: I\u2019m looking forward into it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.:  Hi, sorry about that, I was just adjusting my earpiece. I don\u2019t want to myopically obsess on the immediate term but the stock has responded poorly to the 2% October revenue guide, particularly given the easier year-over-year comp relative to the month of September. Could you add any color on this? For example, what sort of pressures that perhaps that new routes are putting on RASM. And maybe if you had a same-store sales RASM guide that you could provide something that strips out, let\u2019s say, LaGuardia and DCA, for example? Tammy Romo : Well, nothing really Jam, if you look at there is really nothing unusual about standing out in our comp if you look at it. If you look at our performance from September relative to October, there is really nothing odd there in sequential. And again, there is some noise in the year-over-year comparison. So there \u2013 so aside from that, nothing really stands out. So I guess the only other thing I would point out is we do have sequentially few more ASMs and then of course another important point to note is the increasing stage length from just the riding and the flying, so but nothing really unusual. Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay. And for the follow-up similar question as to when I asked last quarter, you had and it relates to labor. You\u2019ve had three more months to begin and better understand what the asks are from your flight attendants and pilots. You\u2019ve had three more months to look around the industry, both here and aboard to see what labor efficiencies some competing airlines might have, that you don\u2019t. How that process is going overall. And how confident should we be that renegotiated contracts and put material pressure on margins next year? Tammy Romo : Well, again I\u2019m pleased with the leadership that the IM has exhibited here and I think Tammy has already shared that the anticipated effects of that tentative agreement are already baked into our expectations going forward. So we got opportunities to do more for people and we\u2019ve got opportunities to improve the efficiency of the company which benefits our people. So I\u2019m very confident we are making good progress. I don\u2019t, Jamie, I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve learned anything different or more in the last 90 days with respect to that point. But we have made progress from a negotiating standpoint with several of our new, new groups. I\u2019m very pleased with that. Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.: Excellent, solid quarter, solid guide. Thank you both. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up to Jamie\u2019s question, can you talk about how much sort of fare sale activity in Dallas is impacting that October RASM number? Tammy Romo : As I mentioned earlier part of the sequentially is we are doing more flying as a result of our Wright Amendment flying. Yes, we did have introductory fares, but we\u2019re seeing great high sales, but we\u2019re seeing very high load factors. So, yes, nothing notable. Gary C. Kelly:  There are no issues. I think it is literally the sequential cost what\u2019s normal to us. The year-over-year comps just have to be studied and understood if there is some question about that, but there is no change in trend in October. October was very strong, very high load factors, very good on-time performance, very solid yields. Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Appreciate that. And then just I wonder if you could quantify the number of idle aircraft, maybe non-productive aircraft that are also not spares in the fleet in 2014 versus your expectations for 2015. It seems like you\u2019ll start to get some benefits from a more productive fleet next year. Gary C. Kelly:  The utilization is up in 2014 compared to 2013 at the same time that we were putting arguably more aircraft out-of-service to go through various transitions. And that schedule just proved to be a little too tight. So the on-time performance suffered. So there is a couple of things going on even in 2013, 2014 that are confusing and I think we\u2019ll have an opportunity, Duane, in November to give you all better insights as to where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and where we\u2019re headed in 2015. The number that I have off the top of my head is about 20 airplanes, additional, out-of-service on average. So if you\u2019ll just take that number with a grain of salt because it\u2019s \u2013 I think that is a good representation of what the opportunity is in 2015, but we probably have a little bit more homework to do. I don\u2019t recall any off the top of my head is the average for 2015 is 20 more in service than what we have here in 2014, but looking backwards, Duane, the number of in-service fell about 20 as you went from 2012, 2013 into 2014. And so that\u2019s the opportunity going forward to restore into service with no change in the total fleet. That answers to your question? Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.:  It does. Thanks very much. See you soon. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Good afternoon. A couple questions, please. One, fuel hedges, you indicated that it really is not going to have much of an impact in the fourth quarter, meaning they are not hurting your P&L. Does that $200 million loss result in an impact in your fuel cost per gallon next year? Tammy Romo : We\u2019ll give you \u2013 again we\u2019ll discuss our 2015 guidance here in a couple of weeks, but at least so far, Glenn, we\u2019re participating in 80% of the decline that we\u2019ve seen. So and of course we\u2019ll enjoying lower physical prices. So we\u2019ll give you guidance here in a couple weeks as we discuss our plan in full. But at least so far everything looks pretty good. Our treasury team is doing I think a very nice job of managing our hedge book in this very volatile market. Again, we had a $0.05 gain here in the third quarter and we\u2019re paying roughly market prices here in the fourth quarter. And so far we\u2019re participating in the majority of the market decline. Gary C. Kelly: Well, and again I wouldn\u2019t call it a $200 million loss either. You understand the mark-to-market things that we deal with and you have to suffer with too in our reporting, but the projective settlement is not anywhere near what the mark-to-market is. So I think all that we could probably elaborate in November, but I think it\u2019s all very manageable and who knows where prices were going to go from here. It is the other thing that I know you well know. So it flipped around in one quarter. It can flip the other way in another quarter or two as well. So that\u2019s what the hedging portfolio is for is to try to position us, so that we can manage our total spend through all this volatility. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Unfortunately, I have been doing this for 30 years. Head count is up 1.3%. Your trips are down 4%. Your fleet is down slightly. When do we start seeing productivity? Gary C. Kelly: I think that somewhat relates to Duane\u2019s earlier question. So in terms of the aircraft available for service, the productivity for the fleet this year looks pretty good except that the on-time performance suffered. The AirTran segment is under scheduled. I think we have been sharing that with you all frequently. In the Southwest segment arguably, at least for part of this year, it was quote overscheduled. So I think we definitely have opportunities to smooth all that out after the AirTran and integration that\u2019s complete. And then you\u2019ve got on the order of 20 aircraft out of service coming back into service, which will also be another productivity improvement, beginning in 2015 and again, we need to share that with you all in more detail in November. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And actually\u2026 Gary C. Kelly: 2016 Glenn, is the year where I think, Tammy, things are pretty clean. So it is just another illustration for everyone that there is a lot of noise in the Southwest performance right now and just another illustration of how strong the results really are. So a lot of this noise gets cleaned up here in 2014. There is still some in 2015 and by the time it gets 2016 we\u2019re clear of it. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  And, lastly, it seems like you purchased a whole bunch more used aircraft in the last three months. Is that going to be lifting what you think 2015 capacity growth is, some? Tammy Romo : Glenn, we\u2019ve been commenting all along that we\u2019re managing to a flat fleet of $695. So all of that was part of the plan. So no, no new news there. Gary C. Kelly: Yes, remember we\u2019re retiring 88 717s in a \u2013 what 30-month period. So that\u2019s all you\u2019re seeing there. Tammy Romo : Yes, we don\u2019t have all of that, of course, perfectly time. But there were no new information there. We\u2019ve been saying all along that we\u2019re going to augment our firm deliveries from Boeing with aircraft from the pre-owned market. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you very much. Tammy Romo : Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus &Co.: Hi, good morning. Gary or Tammy, I am wondering if the success you\u2019ve had with the change to your no-show policy. I can\u2019t imagine that much impact on customer loyalty if that\u2019s changed the way you think about your reservation change policy? Gary C. Kelly: You mean our changed fee\u2026 Joseph W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus &Co.: Yes. Gary C. Kelly: So I\u2019ll just give you an answer before an explanation. I don\u2019t think that there is any correlation. I think most reasonable people understands the fairness of a no-show policy. But if I am not going to show up, I can at least give the airline that the notice that they have the seat back for resell. I got to keep my money and use it again. I think that that is eminently fair. Most of the complaints I get from customers above that is they didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t realize that that policy was in effect. And they don\u2019t like it. so I will \u2013 I am not going to try to argue with you that the customers don\u2019t care about it, because they don\u2019t like the no-show policy, those that stumble into it. But our customers, for the most part now have adapted well to that. And it\u2019s very fair. Change fee is very different we and don\u2019t have any plans to make a change to our policy. I would lump that in at least it would have answered, you know, about bag fees. So no plans to make any changes to either one of us. Joseph W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus &Co.: Okay. And then, Tammy, I think last quarter you talked about first quarter capacity up about 5%. I\u2019m wondering if you have a similar outlook for second quarter now. Tammy Romo : We are going to share all of that with you here in a couple of weeks. So, stay tuned on that. We\u2019ll walk through our capacity plans in some detail. But really what we said you know for our 2015 is that we\u2019re expecting our seat to increase about 3% and of course I assume year-over-year would exceed that because of the nature of that flying. It will be more longer haul and to the point Gary made earlier on utilization just to increase the utilization of the fleet. Gary C. Kelly: And, again, I would just recap the overview right now for you all for 2015 is really nothing has changed. The fleet plans are unchanged. We\u2019ll be roughly flat, maybe a few more units at the end of 2015. The seats are increasing simply because the gauge is increasing. We may end up with some increase in trips, but it won\u2019t be very much. Where we\u2019re expanding is as important to the conversation is anything which is its Dallas Love Field, and most of that you know, there is a few things that we may do that Love Field next year, but the vast majority you know. And I mentioned to you DCA. And then just again reemphasized with everyone that the most ambitious expansion for us is international and our international plants are very measured and will have only a modest impact on our capacity growth next year. So those are the headlines, those are not new. We\u2019re in the final stages of completing our 2015 plan and anxious to share it with you all in a month. Tammy Romo : Just to emphasize where the capacity is going is what\u2019s important here for the first quarter virtually most of that capacity is going into Dallas Love Field. Operator : And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks. Marcy Brand :  Thanks, Tom. I just want to thank everyone again for joining us today and have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President Communication & Outreach. Linda B. Rutherford:  Good afternoon, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d be happy to take your questions if you go ahead, Tom, and give them the instructions to be able to queue up and do that. Operator : Yes, ma\u2019am. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jack Nicas with The Wall Street Journal. Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal :  Thank you. Nice quarter everyone. I\u2019d like to first latch on to that load factor, which I believe you say is a record and is pretty impressive compared to past quarter. Could you provide any more insight on what\u2019s behind that? Is this simply a matter of supply and demand, the demand environment is that strong? Or have you guys been fiddling with your pricing, or seeing more business travelers et cetera. Hoping you can just give us a little more detail on how you\u2019re feeling so many seats. Gary C. Kelly:  Well, thank you, Jack. We can try. I think it\u2019s probably, unfortunately, not a simple answer because there\u2019s so much change that\u2019s going on within Southwest Airlines. We\u2019ve changed our frequent flyer program. I think it\u2019s far better and more popular. We have been aggressive in optimizing our route structure. So one thing that is really culminating here in 2014 is we\u2019ve gotten rid of underperforming routes and we redeployed airplanes to better routes that clearly is a benefit here. The economy, at least in our view, has been more consistent, more stable, driving more confidence and more consistent travel demand. That\u2019s showing up. The industry is not adding a lot of capacity as well. So supply demand obviously seems to be from an industry perspective and nice balance. We\u2019ve had very few fare increases this year. So we\u2019re trying very hard to hold the line on our own cost, pass those savings onto our customers. We want to be America\u2019s low fare airline. And we had fare increase last week of a couple of bucks and that was, in my opinion, to cover the increase in the TSA tax. So if you don\u2019t like that you can raise your congressman on that one. But overall, it\u2019s been a healthy travel environment with a healthy economy and I think superb route management by our folks. I think just all the way around, our folks are doing a great job. I am proud that bags fly free \u2013 I can\u2019t say it, but I am proud of it and no change fees. I think that make sure a very strong brand promise to our customers and break the load factors are also a result of that. Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal : Okay, terrific, thanks and one quick follow-up. You guys can probably tell that newspaper editors love the word Ebola right now, so I have to ask for them, have you seen any effect at all as far as you can tell on the bookings from the concern of Ebola in the U.S.? Gary C. Kelly: None, negative, nada. And Tammy mentioned that in her remarks earlier, so to make sure we\u2019re consistent. Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal : Okay. Gary C. Kelly: And we have experienced with this in the past with other outbreaks and this is so few people have been effected in the United State, but in any of that giving you a straight answer to your question there is absolutely no evidence in any of our research that we\u2019ve seen an impact from it. Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal : Okay thanks so much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Terry Maxim with The Dallas Morning News. Terry Maxim \u2013 The Dallas Morning News : Good afternoon. Gary C. Kelly: Good afternoon. Terry Maxim \u2013 The Dallas Morning News : Could you elaborate on your comments on on-time? What sense do you think if you\u2019ve got the problem licked and kind of follow-up on your comments that that further adjustments that might happen in April. What are you looking at there? Gary C. Kelly: Terry, the changes went into effect in early August. So I don\u2019t if August is such a clean month to try to analyze. If you move to September, we were hoping to get an on-time performance somewhere in the mid to high 80s and we ended up at 80%. I don\u2019t believe those numbers have been published yet Mike, but that\u2019s I am pretty sure Terry what you\u2019re ultimately see when the DOT report comes out. That was on phase to be closer to 85% probably 84%, but for the Chicago situation. But 80% in September was the best performance of the year, it\u2019s good for September factoring and the problems we had in Chicago and we watch this on a daily basis, we compare our on-time performance to our peers. And based on all these evaluative technique, I feel very good that the schedule changes are effective. We planned to do more as I\u2019ve mentioned that I\u2019m really happy with the performance we\u2019re seeing, now. But Mike you\u2019ve had record load factor days here in October with stellar on-time performance, we\u2019ve had somehow OTP days of 90%, haven\u2019t we? Michael G. Van De Ven :  That\u2019s right. Gary C. Kelly: Yes, so we haven\u2019t seen that while [Kery] (ph) and so it is obvious if the schedule changes are having a positive effect as within that. Terry Maxim \u2013 The Dallas Morning News :  Okay, just a follow-up question I would like to ask about the Wright amendment. You are talking about the very high load factors. Do you have a feeling about how those loads will be once the statement goes into affect or the introductory fares go away, and you\u2019ve got your schedule fully up and we get into more normalized environment. Gary C. Kelly: I will let Bob answer that. We do run higher load factors on our long-distance flights and Bob as, I think, you know lot about this question. If you look at the load factor, the last load factor I remember for our 800 fleet was almost 90%. So I\u2019m not going to be surprised if we continue to hover around 90% on a long-haul routes. Love is a constrained market as well with only 20 gates. So any thoughts there Bob. Robert E. Jordan: Yes, Terry, that\u2019s exactly right. Our longer haul flying tends to be in that 90% or sometimes 90% plus range. So you\u2019re going to have that added to Dallas just because of the flight mix is changing. We\u2019re making sure that we\u2019ve got really good fares, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019ve got plenty of local seats available too. So we want to manage our connections of Dallas, because Love Field is constrained. So we want plenty of room for our local Dallas customers and our new Dallas customers. So to Gary\u2019s point I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we, because of the longer haul flying, because of the constrains on the airport, because of demand that we continue to see high load factors in Dallas, higher than the system. Gary C. Kelly: But Terry, I would like to pile on here and compliment Bob and his team. We can analyze why it is, what it is, but we don\u2019t launch new routes and have this kind of performance. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job of managing the overall capacity of Dallas, so that you don\u2019t benefit one route and hurt others. They\u2019ve just done a masterful job. So some of the earlier questions that we had about our revenue trends whether Dallas is, and actually Dallas is performing exceptionally well. And I think that that is a large part due to the terrific design by our network planning folks. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with The Fort Worth Star-Telegram Andrea Ahles \u2013 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram:  Thank you for taking my question. The sort of piggy bag now Terry was actually with the right men and you\u2019re seeing these load factors over 90% can you talk about that how operationally you\u2019re able to handle that? Is it impacting your on-time at all as you get ready to ramp and add even more flights into Love Field in November? Gary C. Kelly:  Well, it\u2019s one of those where I feel like we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders. I think the commercial team has done a great job publishing the right routes with the right marketing support, the right revenue management support. And operationally Mike\u2019s team has known this was coming. The airport was ready. The airport construction was finished and it is beautiful and operating just like we had hoped. Mike, any other thoughts? Michael G. Van De Ven :  No. I think you\u2019re right. Gary C. Kelly: On-time performance has been exceptionally strong and\u2026 Michael G. Van De Ven : It\u2019s been good. At Dallas we factored all those in. We factored the 800 in. We\u2019ve got 10 times adjusted hopefully, appropriately for that and I feel like we\u2019re executing very well. Gary C. Kelly:  Andrea, we\u2019ve had to add staff obviously for 22 digital flights, but all that was well done and all the folks are trained, glad to be there and it\u2019s just going really, really well. I\u2019m very proud of everybody. Andrea Ahles \u2013 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram: So you\u2019re not seeing any sort of impact on your on-time performance out of Love with the longer turn times? Gary C. Kelly: No. No, Andrea, the on-time performance this month is after Chicago was back up and running, which just happened to be the same day that the Wright amendment launched, our on-time performance on a daily basis has been really, really good. Andrea Ahles \u2013 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram: All right. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press : Hi, folks. Gary, in response to one of the analyst\u2019s questions about hedging, you said that fuel volatility is working for you now, but might not in the future. So you have to consider that. I wondered, what about fuel volatility in fares? We\u2019ve had this big drop in crude oil and jet fuel prices since about April, I guess. Should passengers expect to see that passed along to see that show up in lower fares? Gary C. Kelly: Well, it\u2019s a meaningful part of the cost structure. I think the biggest problem for us now, when we get into a period like this is what\u2019s going to happen next. You remember 1999, crude oil, I think was down to $10 a barrel only to be followed with increases every single year for the next decade. It was just an unrepresented spike that took place. So that\u2019s what worries me in an environment like this is what are the unintended consequences that flow from this. So, that\u2019s said a different way. There\u2019s no way that we can count on $80 crude oil going forward. I\u2019m not willing to do that. So we\u2019ll do our best to hedge and capture the best pricing that we can for our jet fuel purchases. And then for the first time since year 2000, we get our return on invested capital target, so I just hope that we continue in this. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re as an industry making money hand over fist. It\u2019s far from that. So we\u2019re finally realizing returns that one would expect from a high quality industrial company and I think we\u2019ll certainly celebrate the fact that the energy prices are lower than they otherwise would be no question of that. David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press : But couldn\u2019t you respond quickly enough if the prices doesn\u2019t stay at $80 and goes back to a $100 to $120, couldn\u2019t you just turnaround and lays fairs back up to what\u2019s going out? Gary C. Kelly: Yes, and you\u2019ve seen that and it doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m sure you heard my complaint earlier about the increase in the TSA tax. That Bob Jordan and our revenue management folks are concerned about trying to pass that along. We would always see an impact from increasing fares. So whether it is ultimately revenue positive is a question of the strength of the demand at the time and many times it\u2019s not very productive. So, I mean, if you go back to 2008, there was a very sharp spike in energy prices, all carriers tried to raise fares, five went bankrupt that aren\u2019t here anymore. So no, the answer is absolutely not. You can\u2019t count on that. So that\u2019s a different way what I would not want to do to customers is take them through the same volatile ride with fares, lowered in one day, raised in the next day, I think that that would be absolutely the worst thing that we could do when we have absolutely no plan to do that. David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from (indiscernible). Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. To clarify these comments, are you locking in today\u2019s few prices under call options or you waiting to see if prices continue to fall for jet fuel? Gary C. Kelly: I just didn\u2019t hear the first part of your question if you don\u2019t mind in repeating it. Unidentified Analyst : Of course, are you locking in today\u2019s fuel prices under call options or are you going to wait for price to fall more before creating new hedge contract. Gary C. Kelly: Well, let me let Tammy to answer that. The short answer is no we\u2019re not. We don\u2019t lock-in prices but let me let Tammy at least explain a little bit about our hedging. Tammy Romo :  Yes on just for 2015, we\u2019re currently about 40% hedge for 2014. And that\u2019s really been online with where we\u2019ve been for 2015 for quite some time. So we\u2019ve got positions out through 2018, they were 40% hedged. And on 2015, 2016, 2017 and then we have about a 5% position out in 2018. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Gary C. Kelly: And with those positions we don\u2019t actually lock the price. We buy options that would cap the price. So more prices it does provide an opportunity for us buy more and obviously Tammy and her team will work and think about that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay great thank you. And one other question would you be able to specify guidance for total revenue and perhaps operating margin numerically for the entire fourth quarter rather than month to month? Gary C. Kelly: I guess the short answer, that is no. We\u2019ve given guidance here on October but the trends at least so far look good. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Sasso with Bloomberg News Michael Sasso \u2013 Bloomberg News : Hi, good afternoon. Gary C. Kelly: Hi. Michael Sasso \u2013 Bloomberg News : Given the JetBlue had a earlier sided some overcapacity, or falling yields in Latin America. And I guess the question is that you mentioned earlier that your international operations were kind of weighing on your results. So can you quantify, just talk about, is over capacity or falling yields in Latin America weighing on, how much is that weighing on your results if anything? Gary C. Kelly: Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify a little bit. The conversion from AirTran of Southwest adds more flights in the former AirTran markets, and number one. Number two, it also adds, we\u2019re also not fully connected to all of the Southwest Airlines route network, because we were facing in those flights to all of our locations gradually. So, for example, while we might have a nonstop flight from Baltimore to the Caribbean, if a customer was originating in Rochester, New York, they might not be able to get an international itinerary yet, whereas in the future they will. So we are facing in our international operations gradually and right now the financial performance isn\u2019t what one would expect once those markets are mature. There is nothing unusual about this. There is nothing unexpected. It\u2019s a brand new venture for us. It really has nothing in other words to do with macro issues or whether there is too much supply or too little supply. Those routes were performing very well on AirTran and I expect by this time next year, they will be performing very well on Southwest Airlines. With respect to your broader question \u2013 so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on within Southwest in other words. So that is simply a transition effort that we\u2019ve got to work through and we\u2019re working through it very well and I have every confidence that we\u2019ll be where we need to be this time next year. Now with respect to whether there is too much capacity or concerns about us adding more flights, not on the routes that we\u2019ve selected. So I mentioned that we\u2019ll be serving Costa Rica. We\u2019ve announced service between Baltimore/Washington and San Jose, Costa Rica beginning March 7 that as one flight a day each way. We are very confident that that flight will perform very, very well. So we don\u2019t have a large amount of Southwest capacity in international. We don\u2019t plan to have a lot more next year. So, none of these are concerns that we would share at Southwest. Operator :  And we have time for one final question. Today, we\u2019ll take our last question from (indiscernible) with Flightglobal. Unidentified Analyst :  Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned just now that you plan to be adding a handful of international destinations this year. Most of this is going to be from Houston-Aruba? Or are you looking at elsewhere? Gary C. Kelly:  Well, we haven\u2019t said yet, but clearly we do plan to launch service when the terminal is ready in Houston and so we\u2019ll just need to stay tuned on that. But the handful really means probably three or four more new cities for Southwest Airlines service next year. So we\u2019re excited about that. It won\u2019t attract a lot of flights. It won\u2019t be a lot of incremental capacity with obviously you\u2019ll be \u2013 what we hope will be some exciting new destinations, so stay tuned. Operator : At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford: Thanks Tom. We appreciate you all being with us. If you have any follow-up questions, the media can reach us at SWAmedia.com or through our direct line at 214-792-4847. Thanks so much. Operator :  And, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining.",

My name is Matthew and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and the replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Matthew and good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call to discuss our fourth quarter and annual 2014 results. Joining me on the call is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Van De Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer. We will begin with opening remarks from Gary followed by Tammy providing a review of our results and our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks. Today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. And now I would like to turn the call over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Marcy and good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Our fourth quarter earnings excluding items were a record, dramatically surpassing last year's previous record by 79%. Our revenues were up $200 million and interestingly enough fuel was down $200 million and the result was a beautiful thing. So for the first time in 14 years, we achieved our ROIC target and in this case we exceeded it with a 21.2% return on invested capital. The operating performance was propelled by the successful deployment of our strategic initiatives, very pleased with the Rapid Rewards for the year, that was an almost $400 million revenue contribution. The fleet modernization effort for 2014 was $0.5 billion, as was the AirTran integration synergies of $500 million for the year, so we're very pleased with all of that. Without any one of those of course we would not have had the stellar results that we did, but our people have done a magnificent job managing all the transformational change over the last 5 to 10 years. They are passionate about Southwest, passionate about serving our customers, better than our competitors and with a reliable and low cost operation and I could not be more proud of them, strategic initiatives aside, we would not have Southwest as we know it without these incredible people. So my thanks to all of them, but also my congratulations to them because they have been richly rewarded. We've had tremendous stock price appreciation. Last year we increased the dividend by 50% and then, of course we had record profit sharing for 2014. So just turning as to what happens next in our business. Our earnings outlook is superb, if for no other reason than fuel costs are down dramatically year-over-year. Our business remains steady, although I would alert everyone to be mindful of the distortions in analyzing our performance on a unit basis and as we point out, that's caused by the increased utilization of the fleet, the increased stage length, the increase in the gauge all leading to very healthy ASM growth. I also want to remind everyone again of the large percentage of our route system that is under development and that translates primarily to international markets that have been converted from AirTran, the Dallas Love Field expansion with the repeal of the Wright Amendment on October 13. Dallas available seat mile capacity by the way is up over 80% in the fourth quarter year-over-year and also Reagan National which with the slots we acquired, that capacity growth is 180%. So our business has been strong and steady despite all of this large percentage under development. The collapse in oil prices since September of course, is very big news. I think it's safe to say that we're still trying to digest all of the news and the ramifications for us. Of course, in the meantime, we have significantly lower fuel costs and it drops straight to the bottom line for the most part, but we have been and will continue to actively manage our hedging program given this significant change. We've made no changes to our growth plans for this year. We will of course, factor in the latest and greatest news into our fall planning for 2016 and 2017, but at this point we've made no changes to those years either. From a cash flow perspective, we're assuming energy cost will be lower than what our fall plan for this year initially showed and therefore, operating cash flow will be higher. That's a high quality problem. We'll be thoughtful as to our uses of that additional cash, but as a footnote, I would add that given the extreme volatility that we're experiencing in the oil markets, it's anybody's guess what will happen next. So we will manage as best we can factoring in that very high level of uncertainty with energy prices going forward. Again, overall, I think wherever we end up here over the next several years is going to be lower than what we thought before September. So with that, Tammy will take us through our stellar results for the quarter and I want to thank her for her superb financial leadership and just enjoy the review here, Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Gary and thanks to everyone for joining us. We are thrilled to report today on an outstanding finish to what has been a record year of accomplishment. Our annual net income excluding special items was a record $1.4 billion or $2.01 per diluted share which is an exceptional 80% increase year-over-year. Our 2014 GAAP net income was also a record, $1.1 billion or $1.64 per diluted share. Gary walked you through all of the benefits from our strategic initiatives and of course, those were strong contributors to these wonderful results. Overall, our annual profits resulted in pre-tax ROIC excluding special items of 21.2% for 2014. We are delighted and we handily surpassed our minimum target of 15% and as Gary mentioned, that represented our highest ROIC since 1981. Our fourth quarter performance was also exceptional. Fourth quarter net income excluding special items was a record $404 million or $0.59 per share which also increased nearly 80% year-over-year and represented our 7th consecutive quarter of record profits. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $190 million and operating income excluding special items was also a fourth quarter record of $621 million and we expanded our operating margin by more than 500 basis points to 14.7%. These strong results were driven by record revenues, significantly lower fuel prices and our ongoing cost control effort. Our 2014 profits earned our employees a well-deserved record $355 million in profit sharing and I just want to congratulate all of our wonderful employees on just the fabulous results which also represents our 42nd consecutive year of profit. I'll turn to revenues now. Our revenue results were strong and better than expected. Our fourth quarter revenues reached record levels increasing 4.5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenues of $4.4 billion. Strong demand for travel resulted in record traffic and load factors on 2.6% fewer trips year-over-year. Overall, we are pleased with the revenue strength across our network and we saw strength in both our business and leisure travel demand. On a unit basis, total operating revenues increased 2% compared with fourth quarter last year on a 2.4% increase in available seat miles. Our passenger unit revenues increased 2.6% compared with last year's record fourth quarter which is outstanding considering the 2.6% increase in stage length and the 2.4% increase in seats per trip. Furthermore, nearly 20% of our capacity was in developing markets and that includes our new Dallas non-stop markets which took off very strong with the majority of the new markets meeting or exceeding a 90% load factor. And our international markets also continue to ramp up nicely and performed in-line or ahead of our expectations. Our fourth quarter passenger revenues included an additional $55 million related to the amount of spoilage expected for points sold to business partners and as our new Frequent Flier program has matured, we have continued to monitor member redemption activity and behavior and during 2014 with a few years under our belt with the new program, we obtained enough historical data under the new program to develop a predictive statistical model and the model indicated an increase in spoilage which was recorded prospectively as a change in estimate. The higher spoilage rate is expected to continue in 2015, however the revenue impact will not be known until the actual number of points redemption for the period is known. Therefore, the fourth quarter revenue increase does not necessarily represent a steady state quarterly impact through 2015 and without the change in estimate our fourth quarter passenger unit revenues would have fallen within our guidance of the increase of 1% to 2%, but the rate that we expect going forward, of course are factored into the guidance that we provided in the earnings release. Thus far in January, the travel demand remains strong and based on current bookings and revenue trends; we expect first quarter 2015 passenger revenues to increase year-over-year in-line with our 6% capacity growth which suggests a flat PRASM. While it's too early to provide revenue guidance for full year 2015, as we communicated at Investor Day, our goal is to keep pace with our capacity growth compared with 2014. Keep in mind, our year-over-year first quarter PRASM results will reflect the impact of an estimated 3.5% increase in stage length and 2.4% increase in seats per trip, both compared with first quarter '14 and 20% of the market remain under development. For January, we expect strong passenger revenue growth and when coupled with approximately 10% ASM growth, we currently expect PRASM to be down slightly year-over-year, but just as a reminder of the 10% ASM growth, 3 percentage points was due to last year's polar vortex winter storms. This slightly down expectation for January PRASM also reflects about a 2 to 3 point headwind from increased stage engage and maintains approximately 20% of our capacity under development which reinforces the fact that we're seeing underlying strength in January's performance. Moving to freight and other revenues, freight revenues grew 12% year-over-year primarily benefiting from new and maturing markets as a result of the AirTran integration and we currently expect first quarter 2015 freight revenues to increase from first quarter 2014 in the 6% range. Other revenues decreased almost 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the decline of the AirTran fees as expected with the transition of the AirTran network over to Southwest. We currently expect the year-over-year decline to continue through the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the completion of the integration process which occurred during fourth quarter. For first quarter 2015, we are expecting a year-over-year decline in total revenues similar to the year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2014. The fourth quarter 2014 decline in AirTran related fees was partially offset by an increase in certain ancillary revenues such as Early Bird check-in and our A1 through A15 select boarding positions which are sold at the gate. Our Early Bird revenues continued to be very strong at $56 million for the fourth quarter. So with that revenue update, I'll turn now and speak to our cost performance. Our fourth quarter unit costs excluding special items decreased 3.8% on a year-over-year basis largely due to the significant drop in fuel prices. Our fourth quarter economic jet fuel price per gallon declined 14% which also reflects a $0.03 hedging loss which was about $15 million. Our fuel prices have plunged nearly 50% in recent months, as Gary mentioned and in response to the collapse in fuel prices we effectively unhedged our 2015 fuel consumption. For the first quarter, we neutralized our hedge with offsetting hedges which essentially resulted in a $0.10 watch and loss and we are now participating in 90% of the market drop as a result. So very proud of how our Treasury group has managed this really steep decline in market prices. Based on our hedge position and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.90 range which is significantly below first quarter $3.08. From mid-September to today's market price, we have participated in 80% of the decline for 2015. For the full year based on our fuel derivative contracts and current market prices, we estimate our 2015 economic jet fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.95 to $2.05 range which would represent $1.7 billion in year-over-year fuel cost savings. So, obviously very substantial. Turning to non-fuel costs, our unit costs excluding special items and fuels increased 2.3% year-over-year and that was largely driven by the 52% increase in profit sharing expense. If you take out profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs increased a modest 1.2% year-over-year. So we're very pleased with the ongoing benefits from our fleet modernization and just overall cost control effort. This was slightly better than expected due to lower than expected costs such as advertising. Based on current cost trends, we expect first quarter 2015 unit costs excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing to decrease year-over-year in the 1% to 2% range compared with first quarter 2014, 8.5 bps and our full year 2015 unit costs excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing remains unchanged from Investor Day where we provided an outlook of also down in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. Moving to our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the year with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments and we also have our $1 billion revolving credit line fully available. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. Our free cash flow for 2014 was $1.1 billion which we returned to our shareholders through $955 million in share repurchases and $139 million in dividend payments. In fourth quarter, we repurchased $200 million in shares under an accelerated stock repurchase program and we have $380 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In 2014, we repaid $561 million in debt and capital lease obligations which includes a bullet repayment of $350 million on notes that were due October 1. During the fourth quarter, we refinanced with $300 million in unsecured notes at 2.75% coupon rate which is a historic low rate for us. Based on -- and in 2015 we intend to repay $182 million in scheduled debt and capital lease payments. Our leverage including off balance sheet aircraft leases at the end of the year was 35% and as you all probably read, we were upgraded by S&P during fourth quarter to a BBB rating and we are the only investment grade U.S. airline for all three credit agencies. We also continue to manage our CapEx with 2014 spend of $1.7 billion plus $80 million of assets constructed for others which was right in-line with our expectations. For 2015, we currently expect our CapEx spending to decline from 2014 levels and fall in the $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range excluding assets constructed for others which is estimated to be about fall in the $50 million to $100 million range. And that brings me to a quick recap of our 2014 fleet activity. We took delivery of 33 Dash 800s from Boeing and 22 pre-owned Dash 700s and on the retirement side we retired five Classics this year. We have removed all of the AirTran 717s from service and as of the end of the fourth quarter, we had transitioned 52 717s to Delta and have since transitioned an additional two which brings us to a total of 34 remaining 717s that will be transitioned to Delta in 2015. In addition, thus far we've transitioned 48 of the 52 AirTran 700s to Southwest with the last four currently in conversion. We continue to manage our fleet plans to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015 which is in-line with what we've said previously. So as Gary stated, no change in plans there. So we're managing to roughly 700 aircraft which as a reminder was the combined fleet, roughly the combined fleet count at the time of the AirTran acquisition. We expect our first quarter 2015 ASMs to increase year-over-year in the 6% range and our guidance for full year 2015 year-over-year capacity growth remains unchanged at approximately 6%. Our first quarter capacity growth is driven by an expected 3% to 4% increase in stage length, 2% to 3% increase in seats per trip and flat trips all compared with first quarter 2014. The additional seats per trip are driven by of course, our fleet modernization effort and are being produced at a minimal cost, so very cost effective growth for us here in 2015. In addition with the aircraft conversion activity and the phase out of the AirTran fleet behind us, we now have the ability to utilize our fleet more again, generating a low cost capacity that will fund our exciting growth opportunities in 2015 focused on Dallas Love Field, Reagan and LaGuardia and also International. In closing, we couldn't be more thrilled with the very strong end to 2014 and our record performance for the year. The successful execution of our strategic initiatives have positioned us well for future success and our 2015 is off to a great start. We are pleased with our current revenue trends and as we said at Investor Day, we're intently focused on maintaining our competitive low cost structure. So far in 2015, we are continuing to benefit from low jet fuel prices, ongoing fleet modernization and rigorous cost control efforts and are well-positioned to take advantage of our exciting growth opportunities. Our balance sheet and cash flows are very strong as evidenced by upgrades in 2014 by both S&P and Moody's and we're very proud of our solid investment grade rating. We've demonstrated that we are focused on prudent capital deployment and we're committed to taking care of our employees, customers and shareholders. And before we open the call up for questions, I would like to congratulate and thank all of our employees once again for these truly remarkable results and an amazing year. So, Matthew I'll turn it back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll begin by taking our first question from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Tammy just a point of clarification on the spoilage, I think you said it was not included in the roughly flat PRASM guide. Should I assume that could only if anything be a good guide or because it's an off peak carry potentially could it break the other way or is that already in that flat number? Tammy Romo : It's already contemplated in there. We do our best to forecast what we expect the rate to be. Now as always, as part of our close process we review all of that, but it is contemplated in our guidance. Hunter Keay : And please correct me if I'm wrong here, Gary, but I thought maybe in the past when you guys made changes to your hedging program that could sometimes be interpreted as sort of an implied commentary in what you're seeing in your bookings given that there was an underlying assumption that the changes in oil prices over time would be changes -- would be correlated to changes and driven by demand, I should say. So when you take off your hedges for the rest of 2015, I know you're seeing strong bookings right now you made that very clear, but are you doing that because you potentially anticipate some degree of softening in demand as we move through the year? Or is this strictly something different because of what you're seeing in the overall global supply of oil? Gary Kelly : Hunter, I don't know that we've tried to match our hedging to demand in the way you described, so if you've gotten that from us I apologize. So I think the main thing I would say is we have a hedging program in place as insurance, so it's to protect us against primarily catastrophic, but increases in energy costs. So in doing that we're well protected with that. Coming into 2015 with the hedging program that we had in place, '15, '16 and '17 we're well protected. And in an environment where energy prices drop and especially when they collapse, the hedging program is going to cost us. Now all-in, of course we're realizing a significant reduction in energy cost and for us that's of course all airlines would wish for this, but for us a low cost producer it enhances our competitive position because it allows the rest of our cost structure to have a more significant proportion of the total. So it helps to widen our cost advantage, so this is all a good thing. I think the only point about the hedging program is we want to manage the cost of it, so we have unhedged in 2015 because we had a view that prices were headed south and fortunately our folks were right and managed that I think very, very well. So we're not, we're essentially unhedged for '15. We do have positions in '16 and '17 and there is a mark-to-market with the portfolio for those two periods as well that we'll have to continue to manage, but to me, if you were to ask us well, what do you think we should do next? I think we should simply continue to manage our portfolio and not try to speculate on what prices are going to be over the next three months, six months, 18 months. That is anybody's guess. We've got a scenario where we have very handsome margins. We can put in hedging protection for the future to avoid a catastrophic increase in fuel prices which is well beyond the $45 to $50 range that we're trading in right now and just approach this in a way where the cost of the hedging program is sensible. So with the volatility the way it is, hedging is very expensive and hopefully that gives you a comprehensive answer to your question. Operator : And we'll go next to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Tammy, just going back to Hunter's question, can you provide any color on what the Q1 PRASM guide would be excluding the benefit from the accounting change? Tammy Romo : So that's really baked in going forward. We've calculated the rates and they are not that far out of line with what we've been seeing historically. So no, we haven't provided that in the estimates, but that's just part of our normal special steps revenue and that's our best estimate at this time. So no we haven't -- we aren't going to provide that for the first quarter going forward. And again, a lot of that depends on how many rewards ultimately get redeemed as well. So keep that in mind, it's very tough to give you an exact forecast on that, but actually going forward as we get more history with the program, we should be able to predict that with more accuracy, but it's within the normal range of what we've kind of seen historically. Julie Yates : And then just the other U.S. carriers have noted some softness in domestic customs towards the end of Q4. Do you have any comments on that or did you see a similar dynamic in any of your markets? Gary Kelly : I wouldn't call it softness. Again, I think the thing that makes us different is the reallocation of all of the AirTran capacity that we acquired back in 2011. That's what's creating this large percentage of quote development markets for us because as you know we haven't grown on a combined basis, we haven't grown the fleet. We haven't grown capacity since 2011. So what you're seeing in Dallas, what you're seeing in International, what you're seeing in Washington Reagan is simply redeployed, not literally AirTran capacity, but that's a big source of it. So those markets are in development, that's not a euphemism. It's just simply saying they don't typically perform at system average and beyond that no I don't think we have, I would not describe softness to anything that we're seeing. Tammy Romo : I would agree, Gary. We spent a lot of time looking at our results here in the fourth quarter and when you adjust for the development markets, we have PRASM gains realized really across all haul lengths. We saw strength in both leisure and our business passengers and really, if you back all that out and just look at our base of business on a same-store, if you will, it was a very strong performance. So very delighted with our overall revenue performance. Gary Kelly : And of course, we keep emphasizing this and you all can factor it in how you choose, but if you adjust as I like to do, for the stage length change and for the gauge change, that's a 2-point adjustment. So it really takes the year which was up 4.6%, it takes us up to 6.6% and the fourth quarter was a very strong performance as well. So no, softness is not a word that makes any kind of sense. Now the change in energy prices is no doubt going to ripple through the oil and gas economy and we serve Texas in a big way. So I did share earlier this morning in some media interviews that we've not seen any change in the travel in those markets either, but obviously, we're going to keep a close eye on that. But so far everything is steady and we feel really good about the business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : So on the international side now that you have had more experience flying with Southwest, I was just wondering what the experience has been and if there is any sense of maybe wanting to accelerate the growth in international or just is the opportunity in the domestic market that much better? Gary Kelly : Well yes, we\u2019re in the wonderful position of having numerous alternatives for future growth. So we, just as a reminder at this point beyond the 48 states we've got close to 50 additional destinations that we can consider. I'll just use 2015 as a proxy to answer your question. We're growing capacity 6%, 5 of the 6 points are domestic and it's driven by Dallas and Reagan, so all familiar themes that you've heard. So we have 1.1% of our capacity today that\u2019s deployed internationally. It's 1.6% if you include Puerto Rico. 1 point of our growth next year will be international, that's pretty measured, that's pretty modest and I think you should expect that's going to continue for some time. The markets are developing rapidly. We've got a pretty significant increase in capacity compared to what AirTran was flying because we're flying daily and they were flying less than daily, so we\u2019ve factored all that into our expansion plans, but we've announced three more destinations for 2015. We're excited about all three of those. Again, it won't add up to a huge amount of capacity, but we just want to walk before we run. Operationally, we want to be cautious and conservative here and make sure that we're comfortable with flying into different countries and different cultures and different languages. So no change to what we've shared with you all earlier. Savi Syth : And if I could ask one more, on the cash side, if you do have this excess cash [inaudible] price declines comes up temporarily, is there any kind of non-aircraft CapEx program that you're looking at or how should we think about the use of cash? Tammy Romo : We really don't have any change in plans based on the drop in fuel. We're going to continue to manage our CapEx and do what makes sense for Southwest Airlines, more or less and irrespective of what fuel is doing. So we feel comfortable with our CapEx plans here for 2015, so at least at this point there has been no change in plans. Gary Kelly : I would add one more thing there which is we are -- I would say we have an ambitious investment plan already. We've worked hard to transform Southwest over the past 5 to 10 years. We've invested a tremendous amount in technology already. We have big plans of course to replace our reservation system and that will be an expensive project and then Mike Van De Ven is also leading an effort to invest heavily into our operations technology over the next five years. So even without this additional, if it turns out this way, this additional cash, we are investing heavily and what I would consider to be aggressively in about as much as I think the company can manage. So I don't see an opportunity there that would be wise. So we'll have other discussions about how we could use the cash, but like I said earlier it's a high quality problem. Savi Syth : Sorry, is it debt or are you returning cash to shareholders on the excess cash? Gary Kelly : All of the above. So we'll look at those opportunities and I'm not saying that we're going to change our growth plans, so don't miss read what I'm saying, but obviously that is an opportunity for us to refresh those for -- after 2015 and we'll take a look at that or we'll just run a higher cash balance. But if nothing else, it will preempt the need to do any debt financings that we might have been contemplating over the next several years and we do have a fair amount of debt that's coming due over the next 36 months. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes, two questions here. Tammy did you in your commentary did you provide how much cash collateral you posted with your hedge counter parties for your I guess, 2015, 2016 positions? Tammy Romo : Yes, I would be happy to go over that with you. Let me pull up our exact amounts here. So our collateral as of, I guess it's roughly $270 million in cash roughly $200 million in aircraft and so that's the cash in aircraft and $250 million in a letter of credit. So if I didn't provide that I can't remember, but those are the numbers. Michael Linenberg : And then, when you give us your cash position, does that include the cash collateral that is held by the counter parties or is that? Tammy Romo : Yes, we include that. Michael Linenberg : And then just my second question, Gary, it came across this morning on the headlines, I think you were doing the CNBC interview and I think you had mentioned something about competition being the greatest in a generation. And I just, I look at what your ROIC was for the quarter and what other carriers are doing and I didn't know if maybe it was taken out of context, if it meant that you and the rest of the industry was all competing to generate the highest returns and the best margins. Like what did you mean by that? Gary Kelly : Well, it was intended to be just a straightforward commentary. Our competitors are at lower relative costs than they have had in a generation. They are producing handsome profits unlike they have done in a generation. They're running better operations than they have historically. At least from our view of the world they're stronger competitors, period. And we're mindful of that and it's incumbent upon us to step up our game accordingly. So it was just an acknowledgment that the competitive landscape has changed where you go back 10 years ago and they were floundering. They aren't floundering now and that's good, that's good for us and it makes us better. So all I was trying to point out is that we're up to that task and I'll put my money on the Southwest people any day. Operator : We go next to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : Gary, can you just give us an update on where you stand with all your labor agreements and your negotiations and how that should work through 2015? Gary Kelly : I'll give you the headline and then I'll ask Mike and Tammy if they want to fill in some gaps here, but we had three labor agreements reached in 2014, so Tammy can share what the cost effects of those are. We have six others that we have been working on and now a 7th contract has become amendable. So we currently have seven open contracts and it is my hope that we hit all of those negotiated and ratified in 2015. Tammy, anything you want to? Tammy Romo : No, we've included again, anything that's been ratified and they are included in the results and guidance, but the guidance that we provided. Helane Becker : Okay. I think though you have some big ones that are in negotiation and have been in for a long time, right? Has there been movement made on like pilots for an example? Gary Kelly : Well, I consider each one to be big and in terms of numbers of employees, yes we had a number of employees covered, again with our contracts that we reached last year. Well they are all different, so I can't give you a blanket answer for seven negotiations and one is just getting underway. But we have opportunities to do two fundamental things. One is to reward our employees for the very hard work and the stellar results and I'm most anxious to do that. And, secondly, we have wonderful opportunities to better position Southwest to maintain our low cost position and our low fare brand and that's a blessing that we can achieve both of those things. We've done that with some of our labor groups and I am optimistic that we'll be able to do it with these remaining seven. Operator : We go next to David Fintzen with Barclays. David Fintzen : If I think back to the Investor Day, as I recall in the fixed ASM growth there is still some that you weren't bringing back all of the slack aircraft utilization right away, if I recall. I'm just curious given the volatility in fuel, is there some room at the margin either in those aircraft or in some of the off-peak flying that you've cut over the last few years to tweak the schedule a little bit in the short term? Gary Kelly : I don't think so, not really for 2015. I think in theory you might be right but again, like both Tammy and I have tried to reiterate we're not changing any of our plans at least in 2015. We're still very focused on the reliability of the operation that has some impact on the utilization of the fleet. But at least as it stands right now some of this is constrained, so there are aircraft out of service. The way I did the math guys, was I counted up 88% of our fleet is in service in other words, available to fly and \"normally\" that ought to be more in the 93% to 95% range. So some of this is just taking the 717s out of service, some of it is finishing up the AirTran 737 conversions into Southwest. So, David you just have a higher number of aircraft than usual out of service in 2013, even more in 2014 and still in 2015. We can't do anything about that right now. When you get through all of that this year into the fourth quarter, it's theoretically possible we could do a little bit more flying but again none of us are thinking that that's anything that we want to do. We don't have really any thoughts of changing our fleet plans for this year. If you include the 717s at the end of 2014, we had 701 aircraft and that is literally where we plan to end this year, 701 airplanes. So now, again we'll give some thought to what we might want to do in 2016, but I would just quickly add that whatever we do will be just fine tuning. I don't see us making any dramatic departures from our plans that we had previously. David Fintzen : And then just going back to the comments on the energy related business, do you know sort of how much you've benefited from some of the shale, etcetera in Texas over the last few years? Do you have a sense of what the pool of potential traffic might be that you'll have to watch or is that just hard to know? Gary Kelly : That's kind of an interesting question. I don't know that we really looked at it that way. I think it would be appropriate to do that. I can pick on a couple cities where it's pretty obvious that there has been a dramatic boost, but off the top of my head no David; I don't have a sense of that. And, obviously, we're going to be watching very carefully for any change in trends and as I mentioned earlier I'm sure -- all of us can do the theory here, but consumers are going to have a lot more money in their pockets to travel. So that's a fact and my prediction is that we'll get some of that. Obviously, oil and gas businesses are going to cut back and that will result in some reduced travel inevitably, but my bet is that the consumers are going to outweigh the cutbacks and you'll still see a very strong revenue environment. I think what is more worrisome about the future is just what's going on around the world and what impact that might have on the U.S. economy and what impact that might have on consumers and businesses and travel demand. And again, as we've reported over and over this morning, there is just absolutely no evidence of anything changing on that front. So we're trying to keep our eyes on that and plan for the future accordingly. There is just a lot of uncertainty in the world, right now things are really good for us and we just want to continue to be prepared for tough times if that is what emerges. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Tammy, you identified the number of moving pieces behind the rise in guide. I understand Love Field, I understand [inaudible] new routes like National, you know but I would also expect some reasonable tailwinds from integrating AirTran. I'm not looking for an absolute guide, but is there a particular point in 2015 where you start to normalize and you would expect your RASM trends to start moving a little bit closer to the A4A domestic average? Tammy Romo : Well, we are going to see really the increases that we've gone through in stage length and gauge and that's going to continue here in 2015. I think that's one of the that's not going to change here in 2015. So I think really kind of getting out beyond 2015 which of course, a lot of that largely depends on what our plans are at that point in time. But yes, we would expect our -- I think the best is to point you back to the percentage of our markets that are in development. I really think that's the key is how quickly are those going to develop. So I do think that we should see a pick up as those development markets continue to improve. So and as we said or I think we said in the past is that those are developing very rapidly and so we're actually seeing our development markets reach maturity here more recently in call it a year, historically it could take up to three years. So to your point, if we see that trend continue here in 2015, I think that's reasonable. I think there might be some pick up, but I would really attribute it to the development markets. Jamie Baker : And Gary, a follow-up to Helane's question, particularly as it relates to the pilots. We know what the new rates are or at least they are out for ratification at American, obviously. We know what is implies in terms of the pressure on Delta's next contract. It seems to me that the longer it takes at Southwest, the potentially more expensive the contract ultimately becomes or is this a naive way for me to think about things? And obviously feel free to insult me we've known each other a long time. Gary Kelly : Well no first of all, on your previous question by the way, I agree with you that as time goes by we ought to continue to see a better performance by the developing markets. You have a large increase in flying in late 2014. So, Tammy to me, it's late this year before we should expect to begin to see a remarkable improvement and expect maybe too strong a word there. Well, the labor question is really it's a fair one, but the fact of the matter is it is a negotiation and the circumstances change and that can change the color of negotiations, but the main thing -- and I'll just repeat our two goals. Our two goals are to continue to reward our employees who have been very handsomely rewarded with by far the best job security in the industry for a long period of time. So that is an objective and I'm grateful that we\u2019ve an opportunity to do that. Number two is we must keep Southwest Airlines competitive and this is now an involved environment where our legacy competitors are stronger than ever and it's more important for us than ever to maintain our low cost position and preserve our low fare brand. So that has been under attack as the other airlines have gone through bankruptcy. I just point that out again, just to reiterate that that's as much a component of the current environment as anything else and if it takes time to get the right contract negotiated for the parties, it takes time. So we're determined to do the right thing by our people and by the company and my hope is that we can get that done this year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Tom Kim : I just wanted to ask, just going back to your Analyst Day you talked about striving for cost leadership which obviously to us is certainly the right way to approach things. I'm wondering is that implicitly suggesting that you're aiming for margin leadership? And then just along those lines of thinking, I'm wondering like how do you benchmark your financial performance versus your peers? And I guess, just given the fact that you\u2019re going to be going towards cost leadership which should imply that you're going to be hitting, topping your best pre-tax margin, the way back in the 90s this year just given where things are with fuel and pricing discipline. So I'm wondering like how important for you is it to be the most profitable airline? And then in that vein will you be thinking, would it be looking at margin as the sort of key metric to be focusing on or would it be the pre-tax ROIC? I just would love to understand like how you're thinking about how you're really sort of comparing yourself to your peers and how important it is for you to be the margin leader in the industry? Thanks. Gary Kelly : Well and, Tammy, you should chime in too. I think that we can achieve both and in fact, I think this is one of those industries in particular where low cost equals superior financial performance. So it is critically important that we strive to be the low cost producer. That's who we are, that's who we have been for 44 years and we cannot give up on that objective and we won't give up on that objective. The way to measure the financial performance is return on invested capital. We do it pre-tax for various reasons. It doesn't matter whether it's pre or after and all that can be normalized, but the P&L margins can be a little bit misleading. So between carriers, between years, that was the point I was making earlier. We're in a better competitive position with lower energy cost and I'm glad that that's where we are because that helps us dramatically but it would be -- so yes, I do think it's important for us to have as a goal to have the best return on capital of all of our peers. Tom Kim : And then if I could just switch gears and Tammy, maybe a bit more specific with regard to the strategy behind fuel hedging. I'm just wondering at what point do you think it would make sense to maybe revisit the '16 - '17 fuel hedging positions? Obviously, you took a view on '15 and certainly then very positive. I'm wondering with regard to the '16 - '17 positions, is it possible as the year progresses that you could be or we could be looking at those hedges also being unwound too? Thank you. Tammy Romo : Yes, we\u2019ve been, just to be clear, we've been very aggressively managing our entire portfolio. So we're focused on it in the entirety and we provided the hedge percentages in the earnings release. 2016. We just have a 10% hedge position now and 2017 about 30%. So I think the numbers we reported previously were in the 40% range. And then we did have a small sliver out in 2018 and we've actually unwound that as well. So we are looking at our whole portfolio and we do that every day. So we will continue to manage that going forward. Operator : We have time for one more question and we'll take our last question from William Greene, Morgan Stanley. William Greene : I had a question for you Gary, on how you think about what it means to exceed the hurdle rate on ROIC, because you're nicely above it. Your goal is to be most profitable as defined by that in the industry as you mentioned, so what does that mean? So does that mean you should be revisiting your growth rate assumptions or does it mean you should target bigger payouts to shareholders or what does this actually mean now that you're exceeding it? Gary Kelly : Well I think that you've hit on the key questions. I don't think we have anything new to report today. First of all, it's just been September since we've had this change and I'm not predicting it, but for all I know we'll be back to at $100 here in three quarters. There are some that are out there predicting that. So we just need to make sure that we have a sensible view of what the future offers, first of all. And then I think once we get comfortable with that, we can decide what we -- again high quality problem we can decide what we want to do with that excess cash. Tammy, I don't know if you have anything that you want to add, but those would be logical considerations and right now we're not thinking that we're going to make any dramatic change to any of our plans that we've laid out for you all. Tammy Romo : I agree, Gary. I think we need to see some consistency. It's only been a few months and so -- but we'll obviously, carefully and thoughtfully evaluate all of our options, but really nothing more to add. Gary Kelly : And we'll do those what if scenarios too. Now the other thing I would quickly add is that yes, 2014, we are above our target. We didn't meet our target for 13 years, so this is a long term game and we do want to hit our target over a long period of time. So another answer to your question is yes, I know it was above our target and by the way we've got some catching up to do here. So we'll want to sustain these very strong returns on capital for as long as we possibly can because we've got some catching up to do. William Greene : Let me ask you one other question. When I used to look at the industry I would often talk to you about the fact that you had referred to Southwest Airlines as a growth company and now that the industry structure has changed quite a bit and you're talking about sort of limited ability to sort of change your near term plans here and what not which is all good news, what does it mean to be a growth company? Is that still how you think of Southwest and how do you define growth, if so? Gary Kelly : I think we're very much still a growth company. What is fun for us, Bill and again, we haven't talked in a while but we have in really a four year period of time changed the opportunity set dramatically. So we have tremendous opportunities to add destinations, add non-stop destinations within the 48 states, add frequencies within the 48 states, destinations that of course are a vast majority are outside of the 48 states. But we have tremendous opportunities to grow, but as with any company, we grow only if we bring a competitive advantage to that opportunity. Lower fares, lower costs, better service, whatever it might be. So I think that that's a very material aspect about the way we think about our growth. So I think that we can grow. I think that we can grow every year in this kind of an environment as long as we are a low cost producer with great service and in 2010 we had kind of run out of growth opportunities. In 2015, we have a tremendous amount of growth opportunities and it's very exciting. That doesn't mean that we're going to grow 10% a year. We won't, we're going to grow at an amount that we think is sensible for us given our balance sheet, given our free cash flow, given our relative competitive position. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Matthew and thank you again to everyone for joining us today and please feel free to call this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I would like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President, Communications and Outreach. Linda Rutherford : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Matthew. We would be happy to entertain your questions at this time, so if you would Matthew, give everyone the prompt on how they can queue up for questions we'll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News. Terry Maxon : Good afternoon. I have, of course, Dallas Love Field questions. You have 153 daily departures, weekday departures there now. Do you see that increasing during 2015 with the load factors you're getting or is there room to grow at Dallas Love Field? Gary Kelly : Well, we're at the point where we need more than 16 gates, so we do have a use agreement with United that allows us access to a 17th gate to support this level of flight activity. So hopefully, we can add some more flights, but I'm not willing to commit to that yet. So the operation we're happy with, we're real busy, load factors are where they need to be and love to be able to have more capacity at the airport obviously within the 20 gates. So we're working on that. Terry Maxon : Your parking has been constrained at Love Field. Has that -- do you believe affected your bookings, your traffic or even though it's very tight it hasn't reduced your amount of traffic? Gary Kelly : Terry, are you talking about customer parking? Terry Maxon : Automobile parking, yes. Gary Kelly : Yes, that's a rare issue. It's certainly, at peak times over the Thanksgiving holiday it was an issue, but the city said they are building a parking garage. We're in supportive of that and again that\u2019s a function of growth. We're used to that around the system and in the meantime I think parking is fine. I don't see that that's limiting us at all. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Nicas with the Wall Street Journal. Jack Nicas : Some investors have speculated and feared in some cases that the windfall from cheaper fuel would lead to airlines to add capacity and lower fares. So would your potential $1.7 billion in fuel savings this year change your thinking at all on pricing going forward particularly in some of your newer and/or more competitive markets? Gary Kelly : That's an easy answer because I can't really tell you anything about our future pricing plans. I wouldn't want to tip off our competitors and it's also against the law, so I can't really speak to that. With respect to our capacity plans again, I think we've been very clear this morning to say that we're really not changing our business plan for 2015 with respect to those kinds of topics. I'm sure when we get to this fall if we are convinced that we're in for a low energy prices for a while we'll revisit 2016, 2017 opportunities. But even with that, I don't think that we will want to do anything that is materially different than the plans we've already laid out. So yes, we might grow a little bit more after this year, if we are so fortunate that we end up with more cash than we had planned we'll consider the alternatives that we have to put that cash to good use. Jack Nicas : A quick follow-up, if the U.S. and Cuba agreed to allow scheduled service between the countries again, are you interested serving Cuba? Gary Kelly : Yes but again, we have almost 50 possible international destinations, well including Hawaii and Alaska, so not all international, but we have 50 possible destinations beyond the 48, so that will just be one more and it will have to compete for a priority for us. But it's something that obviously is intriguing and something that we'll look at, but we've got a lot of those intriguing opportunities. Operator : We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg. Mary Schlangenstein : I just wanted to ask quickly was there a price or cost to unwinding your hedges and if so can you talk to us about some of the details? Tammy Romo : Yes, I guess the answer to that is yes and we've incorporated that. We had here in the fourth quarter, we actually ended up with a $0.03 loss here in the fourth quarter per gallon, but we actually started unwinding those positions earlier in the quarter which actually minimized the loss that we took here in the fourth quarter. Our 2015, we've been participating in the majority of the market decline but yes, there was a penalty in terms of unwinding those hedges. It's probably averaging somewhere to about $0.20 for the full year and we reported to you our first quarter guidance which included about a $0.10 locked in loss, if you will and it's about $0.20 on average for the full year. Gary Kelly : And then, Mary within that, yes there is a transaction cost depending on the technique that Tammy's group uses to trade. So that's all embedded in those numbers that she gave you. Tammy Romo : Yes and, Mary, just to point you to in our other non-operating costs, the premiums that we pay for our protection are below the line. So the -- you can use our first quarter, I can't remember if we provided that, but that's somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range and that's probably a good indicator for what it's going to be by quarter for the rest of the year as well. Operator : We have time for one more question and we'll take our last question from Jeffrey Dastin with Thomson Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : So I take it from this discussion that Southwest is not considering locking in today's low prices with new hedges? Gary Kelly : Correct. I think it's -- and first of all, the futures prices are not today's price. So we can't get $45 in 2016 or 2017, it is much higher than that. Second, based on this dramatic collapse in just four months to five months' time, it's anybody's speculation as to what prices will be over the next 6 to 24 months and we don't speculate. So we'll look for opportunities to hedge, understanding that in an environment like this the hedging is very expensive. So on the other hand, I think the distance between where we are and catastrophe is quite large and so I do think we'll have very nice opportunities to layer in some catastrophic protection at a reasonable cost and our folks obviously will be looking for those opportunities. But in terms of just answering your question about locking in these prices, people were saying as prices were collapsing, well it won't go below $80 and then it won't go below $70 and then it won't go below $60 and here we are at $45, so there are those that are calling for $35 oil. So you would hate to lock in at $70 in 2017 and end up paying a really healthy penalty for that. So now is not the time for a company like Southwest to speculate. Jeffrey Dastin : Definitely. And just to clarify, catastrophic protection would be against the upside? Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. So this is a perfect scenario for hedging given where we were, prices decline, as Tammy reported earlier, we'll save $1.7 billion based on current prices in 2015 compared to what we spent in 2014 if I said that accurately. Tammy Romo : You said it accurately -- and just it reminded me, going back to Mary's question, the estimated loss from the unwind of our hedge for 2015 is reflected in that $1.7 billion. So I just wanted to clarify that. Gary Kelly : So we save a ton of money when prices fall and what we need with hedging is to prevent us from having to pay prices that put us out of business, with i.e. rising prices and that's exactly -- that hedging worked perfectly. So we protected against higher prices in 2015 and in fact ended up with significantly lower prices. So that's great. Tammy Romo : And just to add on and based on what we've done so far in 2016 and 2017, again where prices are today, we're participating in the majority of that decline. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thanks a lot, Matthew. Of course, if any of you need further assistance you can reach one of our spokes people at 214-792-4847 or via the media website at swamedia.com. Everyone have a great afternoon. Operator : That does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Matthew. Operator : You're welcome, sir. Thank you.",

My name is Matt and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. During the call today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Michael Van De Ven, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer; Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer; and Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please note today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the Company\u2019s current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning\u2019s press release in Investor Relations section at southwest.com for further information regarding the forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. At this time, I will go ahead and turn the call over to Mr. Kelly for opening remarks. Please go ahead sir. Gary Kelly : Thank you very much Matt and thanks everybody for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. It was a great first quarter. I want to start by congratulating our Southwest employees for these exceptional results. Southwest is doing well because of their hard work and their perseverance and their outstanding customer service. And I'm delighted to report that each employee earned their share of a total $125 million profit sharing related to our first quarter profits and it\u2019s far greater than any prior first quarter in our history. And of course lower fuel prices were a big part of the first quarter story. Our economic fuel price per gallon was down 35% to $2 a gallon year-over-year and that alone contributed over $450 million in fuel cost savings. 15% of every fuel dollar savings dollar goes to our employees. So again, a very, very big thank you to our Southwest family. But besides lower fuel prices, there is a lot more to the story and a lot to be pleased with. Our unit revenues were flat while our core unit cost that is excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing were down 3.6%. So, even if fuel prices had remained constant, our earnings would have been up roughly 80%. So we're beginning to more fully realize the benefit of our strategic initiatives and that is the AirTran merger, the 737-800, our fleet modernization efforts and our renewed frequent flyer plan. We are also seeing more fully the benefits from our aggressive route schedule optimization over the last five years. And these results are really strong, despite our renewed low cost capacity growth, but the unusually high percentage of routes that are in development. And that's primarily a function of AirTran integration but we also have capacity added strategically to Dallas Love Field, Washington Reagan and New York LaGuardia. So given all that we are intentionally growing new markets which are mostly newer international at a slow and measured pace. We want to carefully manage our future capacity growth, continue our revenue momentum and continue to hit our return on capital targets and reward shareholders. So our focus for the near-term will be on the basics and that is operational reliability, hospitable customer service, manageable capacity growth and healthy shareholder returns. Our top event for this year is the completion of a construction of the Houston International Terminal and the launch of international flights in October of this year to six non-stop Latin American destinations. This year, we have a larger than normal increase in flying as we increase the utilization of our roughly 700 aircraft fleet from a low 88% to a more normal 93% by year\u2019s end and that is aircraft that are scheduled to be in service out of our total fleet. Now that's the equivalent of about 40 airplanes from January to December. So next year we'll be back to a more normal fleet growth of approximately 2%. Of course next year we\u2019ll also get the full year benefit of this year's increase and return to our normal historical utilization rates. The cost penalty of underutilizing the fleet essentially disappears by year-end. I'm very pleased with the performance of our strategic initiatives; I'm very pleased with our current performance; I'm very excited about our future plans; and I hope that lower, stable energy prices are here to stay. But all-in-all, a fantastic quarter. And with that I will turn it over to Tammy Romo, our CFO, to take us through all this good news. Tammy Romo : Thanks Gary and thanks to every one for joining us. We are absolutely thrilled to report on our tremendous first quarter results today. Net income excluding special items was a first quarter records, $451 million or $0.66 per share which was by far the best first quarter in our history. It was only $34 million shy of being an all-time quarterly record and even surpass our annual 2012 and 2013 profits, which is just a tremendous performance. First quarter GAAP net income was slightly higher at $453 million. Our strong first quarter results were driven by another quarter of record revenues, substantially lower fuel prices and our continued focus on our non-fuel cost of particularly our fleet modernization efforts. Our operating income ex-special items was also a first quarter record at $770 millions and we expanded our operating margin by more than a 1000 basis points to 17.4%. Our pretax return on invested capitals excluding special items for the 12 months ended March 31st was an exceptional 25.6% or 16.1% on an after tax basis. So, congratulations to all our wonderful employees for these exceptional first quarter results which march our eight quarter of consecutive record profitability. Turning to revenues, we were very pleased to report another record performance there as well. Our first quarter operating revenues increased 6% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenues of $4.2 billion. Overall, we are very pleased with the revenue strength across our networks, especially considering 22% of our network was underdevelopment which is substantial. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new Dallas; Washington Reagan and LaGuardia service and international also continues to do well and meet or exceed our expectations. And our Rapid Rewards program continues to contribute significantly with nearly $100 million incremental revenue year-over-year in the first quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of our frequent flyer program and continue to seek opportunities to drive additional returns from it as well. On a unit basis, our total operating revenues grew in line with our 6% increase year-over-year in capacity as we guided, which resulted in a first quarter record passenger unit revenue performance. While our revenue yields declined just slightly, our strong demand for low fares resulted in record traffic and load factors on 1% fewer trips year-over-year. Our unit revenue performance was outstanding especially when you consider the roughly 4 % increase in stage length and 2.6% increase in seats per trip, both compared to first quarter last year, which combined was estimated to impact unit revenues by two to three points which of course, more than offset by favorable benefit to a unit cost. And as I mentioned before, we had a significant portion of our first quarter capacity under development with more than half of markets converted from AirTran. Thus far in April, we're placed with the continuation of solid revenue and booking trends which are trending in line with normal sequential trends. And based on these trends, we expect strong passenger revenue growth in April and on approximately 6% to 7% year-over-year ASM growth. We currently expect April PRASM, passenger revenue per available seat mile to decline 2% year-over-year. Keep in mind, year-over-year unit revenue comparisons for second quarter will be more challenging than third due to the 7% versus 6% year-over-year ASM growth with second quarter stage length estimated to increase little over 4% and gauge to increase over 2% both year-over-year. And as a reminder we have a significant spoilage adjustments in second quarter \u201814 when normalized across, resulted in year-over-year PRASM trends, 9% for April; 10% from May last year and up 8% for June. We are also pleased with our freight and other revenue. Our award winning cargo team, recently recognized by Air Cargo World for the sixth consecutive year .They produced a double-digit increase in freight revenues in first quarter. We currently expect second quarter\u2019s 2015 freight revenues to increase slightly from first quarter 2015. Other revenues declined slightly year-over-year from the elimination of AirTran fees with the integration completed in December last year. And this was largely offset by a strong performance in certain ancillary revenues such as EarlyBird Check-In and A1 through a 15 upgraded boarding positions sold at a gate. Our EarlyBird revenues increased 25% year-over-year to $68 million and other ancillary revenues were approximately $40 million. We expect second quarter 2015 other revenues to increase from first quarter level but decline year-over-year. Turning to our cost performance, our first quarter unit cost excluding special items decreased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to lower fuel prices as well as ongoing cost control efforts. Our first quarter economic jet fuel price per gallon declined 35% year-over-year to $2 which resulted in over $450 million in fuel savings in just first quarter. Based on our hedge position and market prices as of last Thursday, we expect our second quarter fuel price per gallon to also be approximately $2 which is significantly below second quarter 2014\u2019s $3.02. And we currently estimate year-over-year fuel cost savings for full year 2015 to approach $1.4 billion, based on current market prices. Excluding special items in fuel, our unit costs were comparable to first quarter last year and this does include over 100% increase in profit sharing and 401(k) Savings Plan's expense just over $200 million compared with $99 million in first quarter last year. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit cost decreased 3.6% year-over-year which reflects the benefit of our fleet modernization. Maintenance unit cost in particular declined 30% year-over-year, primarily due to the retirement of the 717 fleet. But based on our current cost trends, we expect second quarter 2015 unit cost excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to decrease year-over-year in the 1% to 2% range as compared with second quarter 2014 7.776. And for full year 2015, unit cost excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, they are estimated to decrease approximately 2% year-over-year which is slightly better than our previous guidance. So moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and we also have our $1 billion revolving credit line fully available. We continue to generate tremendous free cash flows which allows us to make prudent investments in the business while returning value to our shareholders. Our first quarter operating cash flows grew 30% year-over-year to $1.45 billion which exceeded our CapEx of $573 million and assets constructed for others a net of reimbursement of $20 million to result in first quarter free cash flow of $859 million. We returned $381 million to our shareholders during first quarter through $300 million in share repurchases and $81 million in dividend payments. We have $80 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization which we intend to complete next month. We also repaid $51 million in debt and capital lease obligations during first quarter and we intend to repay an additional $133 million during the remainder of 2015. Our balance sheet is strong with leverage including off balance sheet aircraft leases up 34% as of the end of the quarter and we remain the only investment grade U.S. airline by all three credit agencies. For 2015, we continue to expect to our cap spending to fall in the $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion range, excluding our assets constructed for others which is estimated to be in the $50 million to $100 million range net. We continue to carefully manage our invested capital which we've reduced by $1.3 billion since 2012. Overall, we remain very pleased with the consistent strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flow generation which allows us to maintain a balanced approach to cap deployment which includes the ability to reach our significant value back to our shareholders, our employees and customers alike. And that brings me to a quick recap of our first quarter 2015 fleet activity. We ended the quarter with 679 aircrafts in our fleet. We took delivery of seven dash 800s from Boeing and eight pre-owned dash 700s and we retired one dash 500s. We have transitioned a 63 717s to Delta which brings us to 25 remaining that we will be transitioned to Delta by the end of this year. All 52 AirTran dash 700s are converted to the Southwest livery with last five completed during first quarter. We continue to manage to baseline of roughly 700 aircraft by the end of this year and we expect our second quarter 2015 ASMs to increase year-over-year approximately 7%. And our full year 2015 capacity growth remains on pace to also increase 7% year-over-year target, again largely on Dallas with the smaller portion on Washington Reagan, LaGuardia and international. The response to our new markets has been very gratifying and our development markets continue to perform at or ahead of expectation. Also keep in mind, there will be a carryover impact of our 2015 ASM growth into 2016. The full year effect of 2015's expansion is estimated to increase 2016 ASMs by 5% year-over-year. We expect any further 2016 growth above that to be modest. And we expect our 2016 year-over-year fleet growth to be approximately 2%. So in conclusion, I'd like to once again thank our 47,000 employees for their tremendous efforts and congratulating them on exceptional first quarter performance which is a strong start to what is shaping up to be just a spectacular year. Our revenue and booking trends remain strong thus far into second quarter and our cost performance was solid. We are continuing to benefit from substantially lower year-over-year jet fuel prices and our ongoing cost control efforts are also delivering results. We have a low cost structure and we will continue our rigorous efforts to improve efficiency. We have a strong financial foundation and strong cash flow and we remain focused on prudent capital allocation. We are reinvesting in our business with the focus on generating strong returns and we have continued our aggressive management of our invested capital through share repurchases and cash dividend. Coming off a record 2014, we\u2019re delighted with the strong start to this year. And based on current trends, we expect another record performance, profit performance in second quarter. And with that overview, Matt we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will now begin with our first question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Gary, thanks for the color on the 2016 capacity. How should we think about the mix between domestic and international as we assume a mid-single-digit growth rate next year? Would it be roughly half and half, or how should we think about that? Gary Kelly : Well, I think at least the way I'm thinking about it, I\u2019ll get Tammy to cleanup anything I mess up here. You\u2019ve got this carryover effect of year-over-year growth in 2016, based on the increased flying activity that we have taking place in 2015. And as an illustration, we\u2019re really not adding any new flights that I recall at least in Washington Reagan in 2015, but yet the -- since that was really done in the latter half of 2014, Reagan is showing up is a fairly significant impact on our growth rate here in 2015. So, you will have those kinds of things flowing through 2016. Just isolating the new part, the new flying that we will be adding in 2016, it is roughly split between domestic and international. So, we will be adding flights late this year of course in Houston. Tammy, I want to say that next year we\u2019re looking at roughly one point of additional flying for international that would be on top of the full year effect of what you would be saying added to Houston later on this year. So in total, it will be very -- I don't know the exact number off the top of my head but it\u2019d be some kind of low single-digits and then on top of that we will have some additional domestic flying that we will add next year. But pretty modest incremental growth planned for 2016 above the running rate that\u2019s established here in 2015. Julie Yates : And then Tammy, one for you, when we think about the down 2% unit revenue guidance for April, are the headwinds that you called out, the tough compare stage and gauge and spoilage. Are those the extent of the headwinds or are you seeing fair compression, increases in competitive capacity as some other carries have mentioned that are pressuring unit revenues as well? Tammy Romo : Julie, I would say that our pressure on unit revenues is exactly what you said is largely driven from stage and gauge, and of course just a large percentage of our network under development. So that we always have some movement in competitive capacity but the majority of that pressure is driven from just longer haul flying and increased gauge. Gary Kelly : Obviously the timing of Easter is always a little tricky in these trends and comps. So, we've taken all that into account. If you will just compare, I think just our trend argument comparing second quarter to first quarter, the trend looks very normal. And that is again taking into account the holiday timing. But we feel like everything is looking good and as Tammy has been very clear in pointing out, we have lot of developing markets that we are staying on top of and carefully managing and our hope of course is that those continue to improve over time. I can\u2019t guarantee that but we are very pleased with the developing markets progress that we\u2019ve seen so far. Julie Yates : Directionally, how do you expect May and June to trend relative to April on a year-on-year basis? Tammy Romo : Well, we gave you the guidance, I guess I\u2019ve shared with you already the -- when you just look at the comparisons last year, April was up about 9%; May was up about 10%; and June was up a little bit less, about 8%. So, not too much is there the across the months in terms of comparisons relative to last year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : I'm not sure, if Bob Jordan is on the line or this is a question for Gary. But as we think about IT, how much is IT holding you guys back from implementing things that you think your customers want? Whether that's an unbundled, more of an unbundled product or not, or maybe things that help optimize returns without feeling you're taking something away from your customers. If I could maybe get you to sort of think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 right now in terms of where you are in the investment horizon as it relates to specifically IT, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Gary Kelly : Hunter, Bob, he\u2019s here. So, certainly want Bob and Mike may want to chime in as well. But we\u2019re all impatient and have opportunities that are before us that we would love to be able to capitalize on. We have operational improvements that we\u2019re very desirous of and we\u2019ve got customer experience improvement. So, it really covers all three categories, financial; service; and operations. I think what is exciting is we know that we\u2019ve got opportunities to continue to invest that will generate very handsome returns. I am a little reluctant to put a number on it. I\u2019ll defer to Bob and Mike to see if there is something they want to share there, but the headline of course is a new reservation system which comes with enhanced capabilities that really address all three of those objectives and we have been forthcoming that we think that\u2019s worth a lot of money, some things fall into revenue management techniques which we for competitive reasons we leave that as a rather vague headline. But I think we\u2019re very happy with our product; I think we\u2019re happy with our customer experience; I don\u2019t see that there is anything that is dramatic, it's being held back from what we\u2019re doing. I will fully admit that a new revenue reservation system will come with capabilities that will explore whether it's code sharing or whether it's signing seats and things like that. But we\u2019re not at this point committed to making any of those kinds of changes yet either. So, I feel like we\u2019re doing really good. And clearly what I hope to communicate here is absolutely we know there is returns on investment as we continue to invest in IT. Bob Jordan : I think I\u2019d say the same thing; there is always more technology work to do than you can do in a year. If you can, may waive the magic wand, there would be things we would do I think tomorrow. But I think we have a really good program as we have very measured implementations across \u201815, \u201816, \u201817; biggest of course is the new reservation platform. The other thing is the big initiatives that are contributing a lot right now, fleet modernization; network optimization maturing the markets; the big contribution from the Rapid Rewards program. None of those items are being held up by IT at all. So, the things that are really contributing, so actually Rapid Rewards, they are not burden a lack of IT investment, in fact most of that\u2019s behind us. As Gary mentioned, we\u2019ve got big things that will contribute coming on as we -- especially as we get the new reservation system in place. So more robust fare rules, more robust access to some ancillary items, some continued O&D revenue management improvement some of that\u2019s already in place. So, I think another way to look at that is we\u2019ve got items that will contribute across the next three to five years as we implement technology. So, I think we\u2019ll see a continued boost as we bring those online as well. But there are always things you should love to do, but I feel really good about where we are especially with the things that are contributing again and are not dependent on IT at this point. Hunter Keay : Thank you, Bob. And a question again for Gary here is you guys have made comments in the last couple years about keeping your growth roughly in line with GDP. But 7% this year, even if you look at that on a seat basis, we'll say it's up four and then next year you're going to have probably be a little bit above GDP as well. So, I understand you guys are earning your cost of capital and things are going real well for you, but why is the growth at Love Field and Reagan incremental? And why is it not replacing underperforming routes which would make your growth opportunities still exciting in new markets and whatnot but it would make the overall growth rate maybe a little bit less disruptive from an overall capacity growth perspective? Where is that growth that goes away in the event that fuel goes back up again? Gary Kelly : Well, I think we\u2019re not -- we haven\u2019t changed our high level growth plans over the last six months. So in other words, the change in fuel prices has not had an impact at least that\u2019s material on our plans. Said it different way, we're continuing to think about the future with our higher fuel cost assumption which just speaking for Southwest, I think that\u2019s wise, one would hate to order whole bunch of airplanes only to find that fuel prices have gone the wrong way. So that\u2019s point number one. The rule of thumb is to try to guess what traffic growth is going to be. The best proxy we've got of that is GDP. And right now, we\u2019re growing ahead of that Hunter, because we can\u2019t ;and we've got right opportunities that we have been investing in to create over the last five years and now we want to take advantage of them. The other point is that we have 700 airplanes. And we don't want to downsize the airline. So, the fact of the matter is that the airline has been underutilizing its fleet for the past several years, now we've wonderful opportunities to improve our unit cost production and profitably deploy additional flying. I will just point out here in the first quarter, we added seats to the tune of about 1.6% and our O&Ds, not RPMs; our O&Ds were up 5.7%. So as long as we can continue to match or outpace our seat growth, I think that\u2019s the main thing. If we find that we\u2019re not able to do that, well then we\u2019ll start turning dial so that we can adjust. And the increment to the fleet that we\u2019re planning for 2016 right now, and that\u2019s a little p plan is quite modest for next year. So, what I would expect -- what I'm assuming, let me say it that way right now for growth 2015, 2016, 2017 is that the peak in the growth rate is here in 2015 and it begins to diminish next year and then it diminishes growth rate-wise again in 2017. So, we try to explain why we\u2019re little bit over indexing on the growth this year and it does feel like it will revert to the mean here in future years. Operator : We will go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just on the used aircraft side, and the dash 700s that you've been adding, can you just refresh our memory a little bit about how many you're adding this year, how the retirement schedule has changed, and really how you think about the economics of used aircraft versus new aircraft right now? Tammy Romo : If you look at our order book with Boeing here for 2015, we have 19 firms and 17 dash 700s in the pre-owned market and we\u2019re managing to that 700 fleet count. So, we are -- and as you know that we have 88 717s that we\u2019re essentially replacing from AirTran. So that we\u2019re using a combination of new aircraft and aircraft from the pre-owned market. And really at this point, the economics on the pre-owned we've been able to augment orders from Boeing to fulfill our aircraft need. So, as we look ahead, we will continue to do just what makes sense overall to drive the best economics there. Beyond that and at least what we have, we\u2019re still working through our fleet plans. But for 2016, we have 31 firm orders with Boeing and right now four pre-owned aircraft from Boeing. So we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re looking at essentially -- we\u2019re just using a combination to meet our needs here in 2015 but obviously looking for the best economics for Southwest. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just a follow-up there, if you had to guess which one would change for 2016, the 31 firm or the four pre-owned, it seems like the four probably would move higher, if things stay about where they are? Tammy Romo : The pre-owned market, we have plenty of opportunity there to supplement our needs. So I think that's a reasonable assumption. Gary Kelly : And we've got a large number of potential retirements next year as well. So, there we have -- obviously we have some flexibility with the timing of the retirements. So, I think we've made this point over the last year. We've got more fleet flexibility today than I think we\u2019ve had in our history. So it's, we're just trying to do our best to optimize the financial and operational performance to the extent that we have alternatives with the fleet choices. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then just for my second question on the other revenue line, I think you guided to about a 9% decline in the first quarter and it came in roughly down 1% and just wonder if you could give us more detail, maybe we're getting beyond some of the loss of the AirTran fees that you\u2019re not going to lose going forward. Why wouldn't other revenue be kind of more firm relative to the trend that we've seen over the last couple of years? Tammy Romo : Yes, I think that we have -- our first quarter, our ancillary revenues that really came in strong and offset essentially the loss that we're seeing from the lost fees from Air Trans. So, we were really pleased with those trends. So, I agree with you I think that that we would expect those trends to continue to firm. Operator : We go next to Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan. Jamie Baker : Gary, a question on consolidation; I'm trying to find a common denominator behind the deals that you've done or tried to do in the past. So you've got Muse, Frontier and I guess maybe we could include ATA, those were all struggling competitors. Morris struck me at the time as mostly about aircraft. And I don't AirTran might fall between those two examples that was likely influenced by what was going on at the industry level. You may have different opinions. What I'm getting at is what would influence your decision to turn to M&A again; would you consider during an airline bull market or should we assume that Southwest's interest is only likely to be peaked if there is a competitor with its back against the wall. Gary Kelly : Well, I agree Jamie with your historical analysis there. And I'm just going to talk hypothetically here, just give you a tendency, so a tendency would -- is very clear in a period where our organic growth opportunities are less either because of cost pressures or cost uncertainties or we just run out of geography. Then I think you know any company would be wise to consider what other growth options it has, and M&As is one way to do that. That\u2019s certainly fit for us with the AirTran acquisition, our organic growth opportunities were in need of some refreshing and through the acquisition of AirTran, plus the other strategic initiatives that we embarked upon, we changed that. So the other thing that was attractive strategically about AirTran is the geography that it added. It added us to, rather it allowed us to accelerate our development of the 48 state route map and that of course is proven to be very successful. And then to some degree it launched us in international, I think the most important part of the international piece is it gave us real live experience in international markets for us to begin to formulate future plans. So that sort of describes the kind of scenario that would -- that interested us in the past and I think would logically interest us again in the future. Now what's different of course in 2015 than in 2010 when all that was going on, is that now we have more places to go; more places to grow than we'd had probably at any given point in time in our history. So, I would fully admit that M&A would be a distraction to pursuing our current growth opportunities, and one would have to have a really good reason to be distracted. I'm not suggesting that that couldn't be possible but it's certainly a lower priority as we think about all the things that we want to do today with our current system. Jamie Baker : And a follow-up on the profit sharing topic, yours is a simple formula that I believe has remained unchanged longer than the competition. I'm actually trying to recall the last time you made any revisions, you can help me out with that one, but looking forward -- what was that? Gary Kelly : It was 1989. Jamie Baker : Okay, all right, helpful; so, clearly unchanged the longest. Looking forward though, is profit sharing a topic where you consider what the market is doing or does it fall more into that kind of Southwest marching to its own drum type category, like other facets of your business model? Gary Kelly : Well, it has to factor in what the external realities are. So whether it's healthcare, whether it's retirement, whether it's salaries and wages, everything has to be informed to some degree by the market. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : I just wanted to follow-up on one thing on the 2016 growth that I'm not clear on. So, is the 2% of fleet growth, is that incremental to kind of the 5% of annualized growth that's coming from annualizing what you're introducing this year? And then also just kind of curious, as you look to next year, is the split between seat and stage going to be similar to what you saw this year? Gary Kelly : On the first question Savi, yes the -- it's we\u2019re talking about a base of 700 airplanes and along that base, 2% would be 14. So, we\u2019re talking about somewhere in the teens in terms of a net increase to the fleet with as Tammy has pointed out, there is quite a few moving parts. So this year, we\u2019ll get all of the 717s retired, the 717s are on top of the reported numbers that you hear from us in financial reporting. So, you add roughly 25 airplanes that I call them -- in my mind they are still in the fleet. They are just in the process of being retired, but that\u2019s not the way we reported to you. But yes in any event, we\u2019re talking about more airplanes in 2016. And now I talked long enough, I forgot your second question. Savi Syth : The mix between stage length and fees. Gary Kelly : Mix, well that depends. So what is in the press release today are from 700s. We haven\u2019t taken any 700 delivery from Boeing\u2019s since 2011. So, we\u2019re in the midst of making that choice. So that -- if we switch that choice to 800s; well then obviously the gauge will continue to grow somewhat. I don\u2019t think it would be, Tammy, at the same rate that we\u2019ve been seeing it grow. This year you\u2019ve got a pretty big swap out of 717s either for 700s or 800s, depending on how you want to match all that up. But you\u2019ve got a pretty significant gauge effect in \u201815, so it should be less in 2016, if we convert those to 800s. What is on the press release for the pre-owned are 700s for next year. And I don\u2019t -- we might pick up some pre-owned 800s but we\u2019ve really been looking to replace our 300s with 700s. And then the stage length piece of it, again will be somewhat obviously dependent upon where we go, but the odds are that we\u2019ll continue to add longer than average trips, you\u2019ll get the full year effect of launching international service to Houston. The Houston service is going to be longer haul by definition to Latin America. So, yes, I think the stage continues to grow; the gauge continues to grow, but probably at lesser rate than what you're experiencing right now. Savi Syth : And for my second question, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more on how Dallas is progressing? And one question I had was, I mean I know you've mentioned in the past that you're seeing 90% load factors there and I'm wondering, does that signal that maybe you're leaving some revenue on the table by having such high load factors? Gary Kelly : Well they are coming down, so Tammy you want to that? Tammy Romo : Sure, yes, we\u2019re still seeing fantastic load factors out of Dallas and they are above system average load factors. And what we have said before is we have some markets hitting 90%. So yes, so we\u2019re very pleased with our Dallas performance; it continues to be very strong with very, very substantial increases in traffic year-over-year. Savi Syth : Tammy, I know in the past, you mentioned maybe that's the market that matures faster. How is that progressing versus other markets that you've entered into? Tammy Romo : Well, I think if you look at our new markets, I mean normally you would expect those can take years to two, three, sometimes even more years, but certainly at least what the results we\u2019re seeing thus far with our new markets suggest that yes, we\u2019ll have some our markets that would progress at a faster than normal rate. And certainly Dallas will hopefully fall into that category. So, we\u2019re monitoring all that very closely, but so far as we said, our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectation. So some will mature very quickly and there will probably be some that take a little bit longer, but in the aggregate, we\u2019re very pleased that the rate in which those are progressing. Gary Kelly : Dallas is unusual and you're right, I mean it's developing very rapidly. There are some city pairs that look more normal for a new market, but that\u2019s not the majority. And I was asked by a reporter earlier this morning about Dallas because it\u2019s such a raging success and we knew it would be. In fact we were kind of surprise to some of the pundits that were saying that the Southwest effect was gone and oh no, it's been a raging success and it has a 20 gate cap. And it's very clear that the demand is much greater than 20 gates. So, we're very pleased with that service and very pleased with the new airport and we've got work to continue to do but now it is certainly the exception as for new growth. Tammy Romo : And Savi, just in terms of as you are thinking ahead as well. So historically the development markets have been I would say 4% to 5% of the system. And that is close to where we would expect to trend by 2016. So, we will have a heavy percentage of our markets; it will trend down here from the first quarter; I would guess it would be around 11% by the end of the year and then it would be more in line as we get into next year which is more normal percentage of development markets. Gary Kelly : This somewhat ties in to Hunter's question too, one might challenge why would you allow yourself to have a such large percentage in developing markets? Part of this again is just ingesting or integrating AirTran. But there was also a confidence on our part that Dallas would perform well. And said it different way, while the 22% is a large percentage in development, the quality of those -- the performance of those markets is certainly better than what would one would normally expect for a developing market as a whole. Tammy Romo : Yes Savi, I will share one other bit of information just again. It really is a testament to how well our markets are performing. If you adjust for stage length, I guess just looking at unit revenues to drag on our first quarter results is under 1 point. So again just very strong performance. Operator : We will go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Tammy, you had about a $500 million benefit on the cash flow statement in 2014 from deferred taxes. I guess I was thinking we might see some of that start to reverse here. Can you just give some color around what drove that? Is that related to new aircraft deliveries and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes or is it something else and what happens to that number in 2015? Tammy Romo : The big driver in our preferred taxes is exactly is depreciation -- accelerated depreciation related to our aircraft delivery. And unless there is another extension of the bonus depreciation, we would -- which we\u2019re helpful for, we got it this year; it's just again these are yearly extensions. So, if there is an extension, we would expect our cash tax rate to converge closer to our book taxes. And again that\u2019s really driven by the bonus depreciation. Darryl Genovesi : And then just on your comment regarding, I think you said prudent capital allocation, just trying to get some sense of maybe if you could give some more color on what that means? Because I think based on my numbers here, I've got you covering your fixed charges by about 12 times or something at this point and just wondering if it kind of beyond the $130 million number that you said you still have for this year in terms of debt paydown, is that kind of aided this point or is there kind of further debt paydown to go over the next couple of years? And how are you thinking about the potential to perhaps re-lever a little bit before interest rates might go back up? Tammy Romo : We do have a large bullet payments coming due in 2016 and 2017 and about $300 million in each year. So yes, that certainly will factor in. And our balance sheet is in great shape; it\u2019s just in terms of the guidepost, we definitely want a strong balance sheet. We want to maintain our investment grade quality. So certainly, we would want to manage our debt levels so that we\u2019re maintaining our balance sheet strength. Outside of that, we just continued to aggressively manage our capital spending as you can see with our cap spending guidance that we have for the year, we will continue -- that will continue to be a focus here as we move forward. And then of course the lever that we have beyond that our share repurchases and our dividends. And I think our past results here speak to the fact that we want to continue to return value to our shareholders. Darryl Genovesi : So, on the two debt maturities that you mentioned in 2016 and 2017, is the current view that you would cash settle those or that you would try to term them out? Tammy Romo : I would expect that we'd do some level of financing here over the next year or so, but again we want to maintain fairly modest debt levels like we have today. Gary Kelly : Yes, but nothing early, we wouldn't try to -- we've looked at all of that, it\u2019s just not economic to take any debt out beyond what we've already done. Tammy Romo : Yes. To Gary's point, we've looked at that and we've already done what it makes sense to do. Operator : We go next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : The GBTA revised down its outlook for business travel spend this year, so my question really is on that. So first, the Rapid Rewards program is of course evolved pretty dramatically over the past five years. And I'm wondering if how you measure this, the demand segment has evolved and then secondly you know what have you seen year-to-date, and what are you seeing looking ahead. Gary Kelly : So Dan, you were kind of faint there, so you just talking about business travel? Dan McKenzie : Right. Gary Kelly : Well, I can't really tell that there's been a change in business travel personally. And you're right, it's tough to get a read on, we have -- we try to triangulate that by multiple methods. And there's a fairly wide variance between the methods, but it looks to me like it\u2019s stable. You just look at our Rapid Rewards program, it's been a phenomenal success. So, Tammy can cite numbers there but it all looks good to us. And again, you just look at the overall results, you know what\u2019s going on within our route network, it's very aggressive and still we have really strong results. We've got some exposure to the oil patch, we've been paying very close attention to that and that all looks fine though -- pretty much all the way around it looks good. We have a large exposure to leisure. The near international Latin American expansion we have is very heavily weighted towards leisure. So mix wise, you might see a little bit of change because of that but we're not seeing a decline in our business travel, same-store kind of levels if you will. Tammy Romo : The only thing I\u2019d add to that Gary is just -- we're very pleased with our corporate sales. Those outpaced our capacity and we're up almost double-digit. And I agree with you, our business mix is still roughly a third of our passengers. So considering again the mix of development markets and everything that we have going on in our network, we're really pleased with the trends. Gary Kelly : The frequent flyer, you didn't specifically ask it this way but just as further empirical evidence for I guess your question, the utilization of our frequent flyer program, utilization of frequent flyer program card, credit card just continues to outperform our expectations, year-on-year. And I'm just delighted with that program change, the execution, customer reaction, the financial results that we have, it's just gone really, really well. Dan McKenzie : And I guess you know just following up on that and I'm going back a bit in time here but at Southwest Investor Day last November, the view was that revenue could grow online with capacity as this year. And as we stand here today, Southwest has added some additional capacity and second quarter aside, I'm wondering if you still feel that revenue for the year can still grow in line with the capacity adds, or has the world changed. Tammy Romo : Yes, I'd be happy to comment on that one. Our goal certainly hasn't changed, that's not guidance of course but at least starting out here this year we feel really good about the trends and of course we're starting out with flat unit revenue. I acknowledge we have added since Investor Day though, I would point out that we have ticked up our capacity just a bit, mainly for the two additional gates that we picked up at Love Field. So, our capacity's up about a percentage point. So, admittedly that puts a little more pressure on us to achieve that for the year. So, we'll just have to see how all that plays out but obviously what we're trying to do at the end of the day is manage to continue to strengthen in our earnings and in our margins. Gary Kelly : We\u2019re off to a good start. And I would just -- we thought about it in multiple ways, and just remind everybody that if you adjust for stage length and gauge in the first quarter, it's a 3%, almost a 3% effect. So, I think a lot of the answer to your question will be dependent upon just how much stage change and gauge change we ultimately realize because everybody's looking at static unit numbers. So adjusted, I feel like will grow unit revenues. And to me that's the way I look at it. Dallas Love Field, Tammy I'm not sure what the stage length change is year-over-year with Dallas Love Field but you have to look at it, because it's just such an obvious dramatic change in the distance of the flights. But we're off to a great start here in the first quarter; we're dead on with capacity; I'm very, very proud of our folks for pulling that off. And they got a really tough comp in the second quarter. And I think it's a little too soon to give you any real firm direction there. We admit that's the goal and we're going to try to get there. So, so far so good. Dan McKenzie : Good commentary, thanks. I wonder if I could squeeze one more in. Southwest has highlighted 60% as an average percent of free cash flow return to shareholders, again at its Investor Day. And as we look ahead, I'm just wondering if that's still a good level to think about, again as we look ahead here. Tammy Romo : Did you say 60, I didn\u2019t hear what your question was\u2026 Dan McKenzie : Yes, correct. So, at the Investor Day, Southwest\u2026 Tammy Romo : I think what we said was more than 50, but yes, I mean really no big difference, no big change in our philosophy since Investor Day. Operator : We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : You guys had done a lot of work on the Evolve seating in the new aircraft and the reconfiguration and so on. And then with the new aircraft, I saw that you're going with a completely new redesigned seat. So, is that because the Evolve seat didn't measure up to expectations or is this more cost effective seat? How should we think about this new seat? Gary Kelly : I think it is the latter. The Evolve seat is great. We did not have B/E Aerospace seat; it was not on the market when we were looking for seats earlier. I think Mike De Ven found a better seat. Mike, do you want to talk about the advantages of going to the new seat? Michael Van De Ven : Yes. The seat is a redesigned seat. There has been a lot in terms of seat technology over the last four or five years. So, the seat frames actually fit closer to the walls of the airplane that gives us almost the half an inch width in the seat, because there is about an inch and half -- the seat's at about an inch and half closer to the walls. In addition to all of that, it creates a little bit more leg room for you as a result of that, the way some of the seat frames are designed. And on top of it, all the seats are wider. So, it was just new seat technology. It gave us better economics, more comfort, more personal space and it was just kind of no brainer to go to. Gary Kelly : And you're launching this seat, right, Mike? Michael Van De Ven : Yes, we're launching the seat and we\u2019ll start rolling out on the fleet in mid 2016. Gary Kelly : Just another opportunity to offer something new and improved. Helane Becker : And then, just Gary, I have one question for you with respect to your aircraft order, the large customer for the MAXes and so on. Have any of your -- have you thought about selling any of your delivery positions given how low fuel costs are? Gary Kelly : Mike, would you like to speak to that? Michael Van De Ven : No, we haven\u2019t thought about selling any of our delivery positions. In fact we\u2019d like to have maybe, not more positions, but getting them sooner as we have them in our order book. So, we\u2019re very excited about the airplane. It gives us of course none of the fuel burn but it gives us greater range, it gives is better performance with the airplane and I think it's going to give us more route flexibility than we have today. Operator : That concludes the analyst portion of today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I would like to first introduce Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communication & Outreach. Linda Rutherford : Good day, Matt and welcome to the members of the media who are on our call today. We\u2019re going to go ahead and get geared up to take some of your questions. So, Matt if you could give them some instructions on how to queue up, we\u2019ll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now begin with our first question from Terry Maxon from The Dallas Morning News. Terry Maxon : Let me start out with asking a left field question. You've got Delta saying it needs continued space to do five flights a day and you've got the lawsuit going on in the District of Columbia. What is your degree of confidence that you'll be able to operate the 180 flights as of whatever it is, August 9 and not have to accommodate Delta? And what will you do if you have to accommodate Delta? Gary Kelly : Well, we\u2019re confident that we can execute on our flight schedule, we would not have published it otherwise and we\u2019ll just leave accommodation upto the owner of the airport, the City of Dallas. We\u2019ll be fully utilizing our 18 gates that we have worked really hard over a long period of time to get up and running. And obviously they\u2019re very successful flights and customers are benefitting from more competition and lower fare. So, we\u2019re very, very pleased with where we are and looking forward to adding flights in August. Terry Maxon : Does thatassume or not assume Delta is wiggling into your gates? Gary Kelly : We will be very busy in fully utilizing our 18 gates. Terry Maxon : If I could ask follow-up question, your FTEs increased nearly 2,000 year-over-year. Where did that come from? Are you just staffing up at airports? Is there some transfer of part-times to FTEs or contract employees to FTEs? Where did such a large increase come from? Gary Kelly : Terry, it\u2019s pretty much of pure increase; in other words, there is no shifting going on; it's operational. We have some corporate increases for project related needs but the vast majority of the increase is with flight attendants, primarily to serve the larger aircraft, the 800s; it requires as you know a four flight attendant as compared to three on the other aircraft types. And then we have seen a very welcome and very nice surge in traffic and in passengers. And so our ground operations at the airports are also seeing staffing increases. We want to make sure that our employees are in a great position to serve our customers. We don't want to have excessive -- we don't have to rely on excessive amounts of overtime as an example and have some opportunities invest further in the operation and in customer service. So, it's really those two sources driving our headcount increases. Operator : And we will go next to Andrea Ahles with the Fort Worth Star. Andrea Ahles : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in terms of Love Field. You've talked about how successful it's been, but can you break out is that more business travelers that you're seeing or is that leisure? Do you have any color you can give about the mix of passengers that you're seeing as you've increased flights at Love Field? Gary Kelly : Off the cuff, I don't know that I can have a lot. We obviously have some traditional business markets like New York and Washington that we\u2019ve added. And I would at least guess off the top of my head that we\u2019re seeing a larger mix of business travelers there. But Andrea, I think it's just a natural mix of people flying for business and pleasure. What our rule of thumb has been historically is the short-haul flights were more dominated by people traveling on business. So, I think these longer-haul flights that we\u2019re having a probably more normal mix of roughly 40%ish plus or minus business and the balance being leisure would be my guess, but I don't know. Tammy, I don't know if you have any more specific insight there? Tammy Romo : No, I don't have specific numbers to give you. But yes, I would agree\u2026 Gary Kelly : I know the flights are full. That I know. Tammy Romo : I don\u2019t think it will be far off from what our system numbers are. Michael Van De Ven : I could just give you maybe a little more color just on Dallas. We added a number of new markets on April the 8th and they were added with a much shorter booking window; we announced them later. And even those markets and those 13 new flights are full. So, a lot of those are running over 90% load factors, just like the overall Dallas mix, again with a much shorter booking window. And then Dallas in total was running a higher local mix, so attracting the local Dallas customer, so fewer connections. So that really answers your business leisure question, which I think and what Gary I think is probably more average given the longer-haul but it just demonstrates another point to demonstrate just the strengthened Dallas that we\u2019re seeing with every new flight that we add. Gary Kelly : But that would I think the inference is that might imply that it's more heavily weighted towards business. Michael Van De Ven : I think so, and then lot of the markets we've added are more typical business markets too and we\u2019re seeing again 90 plus percent load factors in lot of those markets. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We go next to Jeffrey Dastin with Thomson Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : Might Southwest accelerate the addition of international destinations, so leisure travelers can take advantage of the stronger U.S. dollar and more generally, has the strong U.S. dollar changed your international strategy at all? Gary Kelly : As usual, Southwest is different. So and the fundamental answer to your question, the short answer is, no. I don't see us changing our plans at least right now; over time obviously we will continue to adjust our plans. But all of our sales are dollar denominated. So, we\u2019re not dealing with a foreign currency challenge in terms of the stronger dollar. It might have some impact on people that are -- international demand if you will. But we don't have any foreign currency challenges. We are also flying to near international destinations, so we\u2019re flying to Mexico, we\u2019re flying to the Caribbean; we just launched service to our Costa Rica. And again, I think they are just less impacted by some of the issues that you raised. For us, these are -- we\u2019re adding service to cities where -- we try to add them to cities where customers will know us. Most of the traffic on these international flights are U.S. citizens, they're our customers already; we're giving them more product. It is pretty, I wouldn't call it easy but it's easier for us to penetrate those new markets. As compared to launching service to a new country where we're dependent upon travelers from that country knowing who we are and booking on Southwest that's a much bigger challenge. And then finally, we're new at this. So, want to expand our international presence at a very measured pace for operational learnings and also to continue to support the other expansion that we already have underway which is number one, converting former AirTran markets into Southwest, in many cases that's new Southwest service; and then number two, launching a lot of new service out of Dallas Love Field; number three, flying the slots that we acquired from American Airlines. So that's a lot to take on already. And we're really augmenting that core growth if you will with some additional flying to international markets. And we've been very pleased with how that's gone so far but we're going to walk there before we run and have no intention of changing our plans at this point. Jeffrey Dastin : Thank you, and if I also may ask separately, is Southwest looking to add to it its fuel hedge book now? Gary Kelly : Well, I think yes, we'll always want to continue to look for opportunities to improve our hedging program and philosophically it's an insurance program. Prices have dropped; it just allows for us another opportunity to come back in with better insurance coverage than what we had before. I would say that -- just using that analogy, the insurance has gotten more expensive because we've already bought at once, now we've got to unwind that and go in and buy it again. But at least directionally that's exactly what Tammy and her team, are thoughtful about. I'll leave it up to Tammy to report any changes that she has to the program at this point, I think we're pretty much up to date with what's reported in the press release. Tammy Romo : That's right Gary. Operator : And with no additional questions, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. A - Gary Kelly : Matt, I just wanted to share based on feedback I've gotten from Linda this morning that there was some confusion perhaps that I created earlier with my comment about assigned seating. I was simply offering up an example of the kinds of new capabilities that we\u2019ll get with new technology just as color commentary. We\u2019ve looked at assigned seating very carefully before and dismissed that. We could have built that capability on our own. I was simply pointing out that we\u2019ll have that in the future; it would make it easy for us to relook at that at some point in the future but we have absolutely no thought; no plans; no desire to assign seats whatsoever. And with that I will turn it back over to Ms. Rutherford now. End of Q&A: Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Gary. The communications group is standing by if you all have any follow up questions. The number to reach us is 214-792-4847 or you can certainly send an inquiry to SWA Media at wunco.com, thanks so much everyone. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

We're about to begin. Welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom. Hello everyone. And welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. On the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer. Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. At this time, I will turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Marcy and thanks everyone for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings call. We had an outstanding quarter. We are looking forward to another strong revenue performance in the third quarter, at least from our current perspective. I want to start by paying tribute to [indiscernible] due, which is to all of our 47,000 employees. These are the terrific results. They work very hard to deliver them. They've also worked very hard to build Southwest Airlines and of course, they work hard every day to serve our customers and each other. They're superb and these results are test of that. It's no secret that this was eagerly an all-time the quarterly record. Last 12 months return on the invested capital is all above \u2013 a record. You have to go all the way back to 1980, which was a 29.2% performance. Fuel prices were down 33% to a little over $2 a gallon and of course that was a huge driver in our year-over-year earnings increase. And we assume the fuel prices will continue to be moderate for at least the next several quarters and hopefully long after that. Our revenue production was very solid and especially considering our softer economy than we were planning for, and also considering the industry's growth and seats and our own 7% available seat mile growth. Our traffic was strong. We had a record load factors. Our passengers grew 5.6%, which outpaced easily our modest 2% seat growth. Our unit revenue comparisons year-over-year is somewhat deceiving. Our RASM declined 4.7%, but a point of that is attributable to a year ago $47 million accounting estimate change. In addition to that, there was a 2.6% effect for increased stage length engaged. So if you take all that into account, it really leaves a year-over-year decline of only about a little over 1% due to the somewhat softer demand or softer economy. We have a large percentage of new markets or markets in development that's around 18%. This will decline as we go forward and especially into next year and almost all of the 7% capacity growth in second quarter was in Dallas, Washington Reagan and LaGuardia and a small amount in some new international markets. Dallas alone was up 150% year-over-year. Its load factors and profit margins and return on invested capital, all exceed system average. And in that statistic I'm talking about the new Dallas markets not just Dallas in total. In Dallas we've lowered fares, we've added flights, we've stimulated demand and we've created meaningful competition for the first time in decades, which is exactly what we said that we were going to do. We've added capacity in the second quarter in other domestic markets, but those have essentially been funded by cuts in other preexisting markets that we had served. So looking ahead, we are delighted to announce this morning an amendment, an exertion of our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. They are absolutely a terrific partner. You've heard a lot about our strategic initiatives over last five years and in particular our all new rapid rewards program. So this updated deal is a testament to the enormous success of our new program and the new Chase deal amounts to what is a stealth fixed initiative or at least an extension of the current all the rapid rewards. So as we reported this morning with our release we'll recognize an additional $250 million in revenue for the second half, which will continue on in future quarters and then of course, we'll also recognize an additional onetime benefit in July of $150 million. So with that, along with some improvement that we've noted in our core business, our sequential revenue trends will improve significantly from second quarter to third quarter. So, this is an interesting year for us. We have the AirTran integration behind us. We're continuing to optimize the large number of converted or we call them developing markets. Secondly, we're following through with the secular opportunity to expand Love Field. Third, we're seeing the full year effect of our significant expansion in Washington Reagan and LaGuardia, as a consequence of buying slots from American upon their merger with U.S. Airways. We're following through gradually with our commitment to launch Southwest international service in July of last year and follow through with the launch of new international service in Houston at Hobby for the first time since the 1960s. And it has Love Field like opportunities to lower fares, add flights and stimulate the market. Obviously, the scale there is much, much smaller and admittedly the risk is greater. So we'll take all of that into account with our expansion plans. We're also gradually returning aircraft from an out of service state to an in service state, as the integration of the AirTran fleet or its replacement fully completes. So we're able to grow this year without adding any net aircraft. And again start the year with around 700 units, so we planned in the year at about 700 units. For next year, our fleet plans are unchanged. Tammy will give you some updates as to some of the pluses and minuses within that, but we're still targeting to grow the fleet around 2%. Our ASM plans which of course are always available seat mile capacity plans, which are always subject to change for next year, will be at least 5% and that's driven almost all by 2015's growth but no more than 6% and again that's all based on our current outlook. And I would just summarize all of those thoughts by just reminding everybody that we will very carefully manage our growth so that we can sustain our operational excellence, our outstanding customer service, our strong profit margins and returns on capital and maintain our strong balance sheet. And I believe in our people and I'm confident in our ability to manage all those things, so Tammy with that quick overview I'll turn it over to you. Tammy Romo : Thanks, Gary, and welcome everyone. We're very pleased to report all-time high quarterly earnings, excluding special items of $691 million or $1.03 per diluted share, which is a 43% increase from second quarter last year. Our GAAP net income was $608 million, including $83 million in special items. Second quarter operating income was a record $1.1 billion and our operating margin was a strong 22.5%. Our pre-tax margin grew by 6 points to 21.7% and our 12 months trailing pre-tax return on invested capital grew to 28.2%. We've generated $1 billion of free cash flow for the first half of this year and in May we announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During the second quarter we repurchased $380 million in shares and we announced today that we plan to launch another $500 million accelerated stocks repurchase program soon, which will bring our share repurchases this year to nearly $1.2 billion. Once the new ASR, accelerated share repurchase is launched, we will have completed more than half of our $1.5 billion repurchase authorization in just under three months time. We also announced a 25% increase in our divided in May. Our divided yield is currently just under 1%. Revenues for the quarter were up 2% on a 7% capacity increase, and as Gary noted, we are extremely pleased with the development of our new markets which represented about 20% of our available seat miles. Our second quarter results also benefited substantially from lower fuel prices and our continued focus on non-fuel costs, particularly our fleet modernization effort. Our economic fuel cost savings in second quarter were almost $500 million, and without fuels, our unit costs were flat year-over-year, and when you exclude the records, $182 million profit sharing earned by all of our hard-working employees this quarter, our unit cost decreased nearly 2% year-over-year. And I would remind you all, that in order to fully understand our results you needed to keep in mind the impact of the increased stage land engaged to both revenue and cost. I'll take you through our revenues and cost in more detail, but the takeaway is that our network is producing strong margins and returns with or without the help of fuel. I'd like to congratulate all of our hard working employees on these exceptional second quarter results which marked our ninth quarter of consecutive record profitability. Diving more into revenues, we reported a record revenues of $5.1 billion. And on a unit basis, our passenger revenues were down 4.6%, which is right in line with guidance for the last couple of months. Total revenue per available seat miles was also down in a similar range. And demand for our low fares remain very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in record load factors for each month and the full quarter. Aside from softer yields experienced in May and June, our second quarter year-over-year unit revenues were impacted roughly two points to three points from higher engage and flying longer distances. As Gary walked you through the unusually high increase in stage engage is largely due to workforce in Dallas. Our year-over-year unit revenue comps were impacted by about a point from last year's revenue adjustment first privilege. Our new markets are maturing in line with plan. Demand in our new Dallas markets, and particular has just been tremendous with load factors with over 90% for the quarter and margins exceeding a system average performance. International is also developing as planned, which took into account the potential for us slower rate of ramp-up than a market like Dallas, which clearly had lots of pent-up demand for our legendary low fares. Our Rapid Rewards programs, as Gary said, is a huge success and continues to contribute significantly with nearly $80 million in incremental revenue a year-over-year in the second quarter. We're very pleased with the growth of our frequent flyer program, including the growth in the credit card program and we were thrilled to announce today that we recently amended and extended our credit card agreement with Chase. Terms of the agreement are confidential, however, the amended agreement includes improved economics over the life of the multi \u2013 what is a multi-year contract. For accounting purposes, this amendment triggers the requirements that follow the valuation methodology, prescribed by the 2009 update to the accounting standards versus the residual accounting methodology that we previously followed. This new methodology will put us on a more comparative accounting method to the industry. The effect of the amended contract and applying the new accounting methodology, is that we will be able to accelerate a portion of our revenue \u2013 revenue recognition associated with point sold to take. In addition, under the new accounting methodology and amended agreement, we will allocate a portion of the revenues to other revenue first as the 100% being allocated to passenger revenues, as has been the case over the past couple of years. As a result of the new accounting methodology, our year-over-year comparisons on PRASM will be distorted for at least a year's time, and the more relevant measure of our unit revenue performance would be RASM. With this in mind, we are a providing a RASM guidance for third quarter 2015, and we'll provide updates to our third quarter RASM outlook in our monthly traffic releases. And we'll continue to evaluate whether this will remain our practice beyond this quarter. Our preliminary estimate of the year-over-over benefit from the amended agreement, combined with the effect of the new accounting methodology is approximately $400 million and for the second half of 2015. Included in that $400 million is approximately $150 million that will be recorded in third quarter as a special revenue item. And this will result \u2013 this will result from the deferred revenue liability being revalued using the current estimated selling price for transportation resulting in a liability rejection and corresponding non-cash one-time increase to GAAP operating revenues. As this amount will be recorded as a special revenue item, it will be excluded from our reported RASM and thus is excluded from our third quarter right RASM guidance today. However, as a reminder, when you're modeling a third quarter you will want to keep in mind the profit sharing impact of special items. The remaining \u2013 approximately $250 million of the $400 million estimated impact to the second half of the year will benefit our reported unit revenues. Our preliminary estimate of the year-over-year benefit to each \u2013 third quarter and fourth quarter RASM is roughly two points to three points. One additional note is that in conjunction with our amended agreement with Chase, we are very excited to announce that we have also extended our long-term exclusive co-brand network agreement with FESA. So with our Chase agreement and corresponding a change in accounting methodology in mind and based on our current bookings of revenue trends we are estimating third quarter RASM will decline approximately 1% year-over-year. And while the economic indicators have been somewhat mixed, the economy overall being fairly solid and our revenue trends appear to be stabilizing and improving. With or without the Chase related benefit, July is currently trending a better than average sequentially and third quarter is also trending at sequentially from the second quarter. Overall, considering the estimated 2 percentage point impact of more stage and gauge, as well as our estimated 18% of our network under developments, we are very pleased with our third quarter revenue outlook. So turning to freight and other revenues, we are also pleased with our performance there. We currently expect third quarter 2015 freight revenues to be comparable to second quarter 2015. Other revenues declined slightly year-over-year from the elimination of AirTran fees with the integration completed in December last year. This was largely offset by continued strength and certain ancillary revenues such as EarlyBird Check-in and upgraded boarding. So a very good performance there. And other ancillary revenues were approximately $46 million. We expect third quarter 2015 other revenues to increase significantly from third quarter 2014, due to the change in accounting methodology I just walked you through regarding fee amended Chase agreements. So now, I will turn to our cost performance. Our second quarter unit costs, excluding special items decreased 12% on a year-over-year basis due to lower fuel prices, big cost control, fleet modernization and improved aircraft utilization. Our economic fuel costs were $400 million lower year-over-year, largely driven by a 33% decline of fuel prices and approximately 2% improvement in fuel burns. We are expecting a significant fuel savings again in third quarter, relative to a year ago and based on our hedge position and market prices as of Monday, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be at approximately $2.20, which is well below third quarter last year's $2.94. We made adjustments to our hedge book last fall, as you might remember when crude prices collapsed and we continue to actively manage our hedge book to balance exposure, with our desire to have some upside protection. Since last fall, we participated in the vast majority of the market decline and we currently expect our total 2015 economic fuel cost to decline approximately $1.3 billion from last year. And on the non-fuel cost side, excluding our special items of fuel, our unit costs were comparable year-over-year. Again this includes a 43% year-over-year increase in profit sharing. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit cost decreased 1.8% year-over-year, driven largely by the fleet monetization benefit. Maintenance unit cost declined 4% year-over-year and our aircraft rental unit cost declined 27%, primarily due to the retirement of the 717 fleet. So, based on our current cost trends, we expect total third quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to decrease year-over-year approximately 1%. And I'll note that we are still on track for full year 2015 unit cost, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing to decrease approximately 2% year-over-year. Moving now to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and our operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 was $2.1 billion and our free cash flow was $1 billion of which we have returned approximately 80% to our shareholders thus far this year. Our balance sheet is strong with leverage of 33% including off balance sheet aircraft leases as of the end of the quarter and we continue to hold the distinction among U.S. airlines of having an investment grade rated balance sheet by all three rating agencies and we're very pleased to receive an upgrade by Moody's to BAA1 with a outlook positive during the quarter. We continue to estimate our 2015 capital spend to be approximately $1.8 billion and that excludes assets constructive for others, which is estimated to be in the $50 million to $100 million range net and this includes as a reminder approximately $1.1 billion in aircraft spend. We're still finalizing our 2016 CapEx plans, but continue to estimate our aircraft spend will be in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range and total spend less than $2 billion. Overall our balance sheet and cash flows have remained strong throughout this year allowing us to continuing to invest in the business and return significant value to our shareholders, employees and customers. And that brings me to a quick recap of our fleet plans, I \u2013 Gary went through pretty fully, but I won't go into too much detail here, because I'll just reference you back to the earnings release, but we \u2013 end of the quarter was 689 aircraft in our fleets, and at the end continued to expect our fleet to reach roughly at 700 by the end of this year. Regarding capacity, our third quarter ASM are estimated to increase year-over-year approximately 8% on a year-over-year seat growth of 3.5%. For the full year, our 2015 capacity growth remains on pace to increase approximately 7% year-over-year and that's with seats growing just under 3% year-over-year. And again this year's plans are targeted largely on Dallas with a smaller portion of Washington Reagan, New York LaGuardia, international and other regional market opportunities. Gary walked you through the annualized impact of our 2015 capacity additions which again will contribute approximately 4% to 5% of our 2016 year-over-year capacity. And with a continued focus on optimizing our network, we currently plan to grow our 2016 ASM and the 5% to 6% range versus 2015. And as you think about our 2016 year-over-year ASM growth, keep in mind that the timing of our 2015 annualized growth will create a higher year-over-year rate of return, rate of growth in the first half of 2016 as compared to second half of 2016. So in conclusion of these are very exciting times at Southwest, demand for our low fares and friendly service is strong, and we're delighted with the overall performance of our network. And in closing, we've received a lot of questions regarding our historic 15% pre-tax goals which we've acknowledged is too low with today's fuel prices. Over the long run, our goal is to consistently deliver healthy profits and returns at or in excessive our cost to capital, which is currently under 8%. Given where we are today simply referring back to our historic goals is that meaningful and we will be providing annual financial goals of moving forward. In 2014, we delivered a strong 21.2% ROIC and for 2015 our goal is to exceed 21%. And we are well on our way to achieving that goal. For the 12 months ended June 30, our pre-tax ROIC is 28.2%, which is almost 18% after-tax, and our current outlook for the second half of 2015 is strong. Well, it's too early to provide guidance for 2016. Again, our goal is to sustain health margins and returns on capital in line with 2015. And with that overview, Tom, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, Tammy, just wanted to question around prepared remarks in terms of your revenue trending up sequentially, what is driving this? Is it better volumes or have you been able to push price more than you had been able to over the course of May and June? Thanks. Gary Kelly : Sure. We are seeing some softness in our yields. But again, we are seeing that pickup and just continuation of healthy demand. So the economy feels pretty good now, and of course we're expecting a tremendous benefit from Chase and the accounting related to that new contract. Andrew Didora : And then, if I could just follow up to that. I know corporate is a much smaller part of your business, but just curious in terms of what your corporate customers are telling you about potential future, future demand out of that channel and if you're seeing any sort of slowdown on the corporate side? Thanks. Gary Kelly : Sure. Our corporate sales grew pretty much in line with capacity, and our business mix is still roughly a third of our passenger. So no meaningful change there. And when you factor in the mix of our development markets and just the trend set we had on the yield side in the second quarter, we're very pleased with those trends. Our corporate sales \u2013 again on the revenue side, also we saw a nice increase there year-over-year. And our \u2013 business mix continues to run in the low 30% range. Tammy Romo : You can see some year-over-year declines in some of the oil patch, so I think that's pretty consistent with all the headlines that you would know, but Paul, I don't know if you have anything to add, I think the \u2013 I don't know in fairness to your question that corporate accounts are telling us anything, but if we just look at the recent trends I agree with everything Tammy said. I don't think you are necessarily hearing anything or... Gary Kelly : No, I think the corporate business is in line with the base business generally as you mentioned we're seeing points of modest weakness that you would expect like oil and gas in some cases manufacturing related to that, but we're seeing offsetting points of strength like healthcare and consulting and other sectors, so net-net I think it's about a wash. Tammy Romo : Yeah, Gary, on the \u2013 on the oil related roots I didn't note it in my remarks because all others is treated where there's an impact, it really hasn't been that significant, it's very strong. Andrew Didora : That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Tom Kim : Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Gary, can you just help me understand how you think about the mix between pricing and load factors? And I guess just beyond staging gauge, it does seem like pricing is generally softer, not necessarily weak but softer for your sales in the industry and I'm wondering you got load factors up, pricing isn't necessarily a softer cadence. I'm just wondering, how do you think about that balance? Gary Kelly : Well, I want to be fair to your question. If you look at our reported results here for the second quarter and despite the fact that passenger tripplings are longer, the average fare is down as a fact. I mean you're right, average fares are actually down year-over-year, so there is \u2013 it's very competitive industry and some of that is of course a function of us adding capacity in new markets which are under development. So I think in terms of the way we think about it going forward, we want to be the low fare carrier. We are working hard to support that by being the low cost producer. So we love keeping our fares low and would prefer to have more for airplanes. Our load factors are the highest in our history, and the differential between Southwest now and the legacy carriers is very small. So we like that and obviously if we can drive revenue through sources other than fares like our new Chase agreement, we're very, very pleased with that. So in the end, we just need to manage revenues, and it needs to provide a sufficient margin over our cost and hit our capital returns. So I think in that sense, we're somewhat agnostic, but perhaps biased towards higher loads and lower fares. Tom Kim : I appreciate that color. Thank you Gary. And then just as a bigger picture question. Can you share like your thoughts about, you know the ability to sort of still expand the market. Do you think that there is still opportunity within the U.S. to be growing the overall demand pie? Gary Kelly : Well, again, all politics are local. So I think it just depends on the market. I was asked earlier this morning about why the industry isn't expanding faster given oral prices. There were physical constraints in some places, Love Field is the perfect example, where you can't continue to grow all field. Reagan is another example. So you just have to go market-by-market. As I think about Southwest Airlines, we have tactical opportunities to continue to grow our domestic market which is maturing every year. But we still interestingly enough have very exciting opportunities to do that. And frequencies to connect dots, I'll just highlight a recent one that we've done, which is Austin to St. Louis. And it makes perfect sense for us to do that, and it's off to a great start. Memphis is another one that we've highlighted over the course of the last year. It was an AirTran city, we decided to open it on Southwest. We did not replicate the AirTran network, we plugged it in a way that we thought maybe more sense for Southwest, and we are doing game busters out of Memphis. Contrast that now to what I would call pure expansion, which is as flying transporter and that's different. That's adding higher risk capacity to cities that don't know Southwest Airlines, unfortunately the ones we're adding right now are mostly dependent upon U.S. traffic, when we add a San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica as an example. But nonetheless, that is a higher risk flight as compared to adding Dallas to Chicago. So we just have to do this from the bottoms up, it's not a top down exercise and it's a nice thing that we've reported consistently as if we have a significant number of very handsome and deep opportunities to continue to grow. And then in most cases that means we're able to grow into a market and add some value by bringing lower fares. So how much stimulation is left in the U.S. overall, obviously a lot less here in 2015 than 20 years ago, but nonetheless you still have opportunities. I mean Dallas Love Field is the poster child, which is just an incredible success story. And there were a lot of critics that did not feel like there was much opportunity to grow and they were wrong. So we'll just look for those kinds of opportunities across the country and where they're available to us, we'll put in service, where they're not, we won't force it. Tom Kim : Gary, thanks a lot for that detailed discussion. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good afternoon. So just a quick question on the hedging side, now that your \u2013 has anything changed on your side, is there what you're attempting to do with the hedges? Gary Kelly : Yes. We did \u2013 I'll just walk you through what we've done since the third quarter \u2013 since the second quarter rather. So in the second quarter, if you recall the energy market, started to trend upwards. And with the decrease in the recount and increase in market demand, we were concerned market prices would continue to escalate. So we did add some positions for the second half of this year. But so far supply, as you know has continued to outlay demand which has depressed the market prices. So we're continuing to actively manage that. So for the second half of the year, the guidance that we gave you for the third quarter, includes roughly $0.40 of losses per gallon, but that's embedded in the $2 estimate that we gave you for the quarter, so the $2.20 estimate. So, I'll just point you to, Savi, just as a reminder, really the best way to do help guide for our fuel prices is just using sensitivity and as always we've included that in the earnings release for you to help you along with your modeling. So, that's \u2013 so that's the change that we've made since second quarter, I think the last guidance that we gave you for the full year as a reminder when we unwound our hedges back when the market collapsed back in the fall, I think at that time we guided you to about $0.20 of penalty for the \u2013 for the quarter, we got out of way of that largely in the second half. So our penalties are a little bit greater here in the second half of this year. But on average, I've got \u2013 kind of $0.25 average in my head for the full year. So up a little bit from what we reported to you previously. Tammy Romo : All right, and the only thing I would add Savi is that from a program strategy with prices lower and with a more comfortable cushion in our profit margin, and the \u2013 you just layer in the very expensive nature we're trying to hedge, I think it just argues to be less hedged if that's where you're headed as opposed to more hedged. And I think we're mostly focused right now in working our current position off, burring that off in the most cost effective way. But we've got a \u2013 a business that's built for substantially higher energy prices, fortunately. And the direction of energy prices right now seems to be a bit clear than it was 90 days ago. That's always dangerous to think. We know our energy prices are going to go, so we don't. But at least for right now, we have to have a view, and then we have to have some kind of behavior accordingly. And right now that's what we're managing to. Gary Kelly : Yeah, and Savi, just one last note and we're currently participating in a large percentage of the \u2013 to the downside here, here in third quarter, third quarter 2015. It's not as quick as we were, but it's still substantial and it's producing, yeah, fuel prices well below a year ago level? Savi Syth : Great. That's all, very helpful. So, just on the \u2013 I'm assuming the 2016, has positioned [indiscernible] 2014, is that really maybe kind of balancing some of the locked in losses that you have in 2016? Tammy Romo : That's our \u2013 we're still working on our 2016 and 2017 hedge book. And as Gary said our bias at this point is to lower jet fuel prices. So we're working to balance that as best as we can. Savi Syth : Got it. And if I may ask one other question and not related to the hedging, on the 18% of markets under development. Could you remind me again like what the drag is on your revenues currently. And then maybe \u2013 you think a portion of that will continue next year as you continue to open your market. So what's the drag that we can look forward to maybe being eliminated next year? Tammy Romo : Yes. So, for the drag for the second quarter just to help you out, I think we've reported back to you in the first quarter that it was 0.6 roughly and for the second quarter the drag was a little over 1%. Savi Syth : All right. Great. Thank you very much. Tammy Romo : You're welcome. Gary Kelly : So you know it's \u2013 obviously it's pretty big number, but the other thing I would just reinforce to your question is we've shared great results for Dallas. And Dallas in other words is a whatever that revenue percentage is of our total. But Dallas would have been better. I think as the economy maybe stronger. So there \u2013 even though it's really good, even it has a drag. So I think that there is \u2013 if the economy improves, our markets develop obviously we're hopeful of some significant upside there. Can't promise that, but it's just common sense that tells you if you got these many new markets, that there \u2013 that they are creating some drag. So it's tough for us to estimate that but however you want to estimate is mine with me. But I think there is a pretty significant opportunity to improve here. And that's what we're going to be managing. Savi Syth : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates-Stewart: Good afternoon. Tanks for taking my question. Tammy, any change in how you're planning to report PRASM, I noticed you didn't give the June actual unit revenue growth for traffic a few weeks ago and today you guided to a Q2 RASM instead of July PRASM as you normally would have done. So is there any change of thinking there? Tammy Romo : Yes, Julie. You are stating in and out. But I think I got your question. But please redirect me if I'm not answering it fully. Yes, we are planning to change at least for the third quarter of what we're reporting and on monthly traffic releases. We're going to be providing you a updated guidance on PRASM for the full quarter and that's really due to the Chase agreement and that we just executed here this month. We provided you our estimates but there is some noise between passenger revenues and other. We will be recognizing more of that revenue recognition in other that we have historically. So PRASM, year-over-year trends are not going to be all of that meaningful until we lap and that's when we get probably a year down the road. So at this point I just think it's more meaningful to provide you all our RASM that help you with your modeling. And so, we'll get through this quarter and then, we'll evaluate if we want to continue with that practice. Julie Yates-Stewart: Okay. So just to clarify there'll be no monthly numbers given the... Tammy Romo : There will be no monthly number, but we do intend to provide you if there are any updates to our third quarter guidance for the full quarter in other words. Julie Yates-Stewart: Okay. Great. And then you filed your schedules through early march, when we file again your capacity plans little further out into 2016? Gary Kelly : Our plan is to extend the schedule sort of as normal which would be, I'll say, about a month from now. Julie Yates-Stewart: Okay. And that will be for few months? Gary Kelly : That's right. Julie Yates-Stewart: Okay. And then, just lastly on your goal of maintaining the 2015 ROIC levels in 2016, what are you assuming on fuel? Tammy Romo : We haven't given you \u2013 we haven't given you our fuel numbers but I think using something we are looking at market numbers just like you are, but with or without fuel a year we are managing to \u2013 continue to deliver strong returns and very healthy returns above our cost of capital. So, we haven't really given you our forward yet for fuel for next year. Gary Kelly : You know and duly in fairness to your question, it's a conceptual goal. So a change in fuel price assumptions this material is obviously going to impact what we would ultimately target as a number next year. But on a fuel constant basis is pretty easy to think about that we want to sustain the current level of operating margins from year-to-year or grow them, and then by implication we would want to sustain or grow our return on capital, what we ultimately adopt is the plan is going to be depended upon more variables than just fuel prices, but those are our goals. Julie Yates-Stewart: Okay. Thanks, Gary. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hi, good afternoon. Tammy, just a housekeeping item, you quantify the Chase impact on the second half you also talk about it providing value over the life of the contract, I suppose that means that it does imply at least there's revenue upside associated to \u2013 to the relationship in 2016. Any additional color there? Tammy Romo : Yes Jamie, if I'm tracking your question correctly, what we provided you is just the second \u2013 of the benefit for the second half this year. So if you annualize that \u2013 that should get you in the ballpark and again I'm talking about the $250 million of the $400 million. Jamie Baker : Okay, that's helpful. Second question, considering you took a $55 million charge in the second quarter relative to ratification bonuses, is it safe to assume that your third quarter ex-fuel, ex-profit-sharing and CASM guide assumes the attendance ratified model? Tammy Romo : Jamie, either way we're going to be roughly in the hunt of the guidance I gave you. Jamie Baker : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Tammy, you guys used to provide revenues [indiscernible] routes are you willing to do that still? Tammy Romo : All right, no as well. Helane, we've start that and never we're not, it's a lot. It's tremendous. Right now, I definitely go. Gary Kelly : Provide a delta Tammy Romo : I know, I don't have the [indiscernible] Helane. Helane Becker : Okay, okay. Thank you. Tammy Romo : We're not providing that breakout. Helane Becker : Okay. Thank you for that. And then, I think Gary you mentioned that, Houston was going to open the international terminal later this year. Do you have actually a date for that at this point? Gary Kelly : We do and if I trust my memory to be correct, I believe it's October 15. Helane Becker : Okay. Gary Kelly : Now, we're constructing a five gate terminal and that is required for us to operate and that construction is right on schedule. So it's been a fantastic project, and we're obviously looking forward to launching service. We got to schedule produced, all those seats are out there for sale, what is included is also launch of service to belief and then Bob, I think in November you follow-up with the launch of Liberia, Costa Rica. Helane Becker : It's great. Gary Kelly : So it's very exciting for us and I think the potential of the terminal is roughly 25 daily departures and we are starting out much more modestly than that. And other airlines can use the gates, if at least, if they sign up to the lease. So but we're looking forward to it and we're on schedule with that. Helane Becker : And then, can I just ask a question about the Dallas Keith. I think you guys have to buy actually the two gates from United that you're adding. And now delta, I guess it's kind of interloping on that one gate. So when you increase the schedule on August 9 to 180 flights, how will you accommodate those other 14 flights? Gary Kelly : Well, you asked a very good question, as you always do. Yes, we are sub-leasing the gates that United is leasing directly from the city of Dallas. And we bid for those gates, we rewarded the bid, we obviously entered into a contract with United and we received the consent of the city of Dallas to proceed with that transaction and the approval of the Department of Justice. When we add the flights that we, after paying good money for two gates, obviously we intend to use them and to their fullest and we have published our schedule, we'll move to 180 daily departures and to accommodate the court and its desire to maintain the status quo, we have extended I believe the term as a license, the delta to continue to operate their five daily departures and it will be difficult, because there is no room at those gates. If we do find that there's room then we want that room. So in any event, we all know that, there is scarce capacity at Dallas Love Field, but that is the status of it. And we'll work hard to support the court and their review of what is a complex issue. We don't see it as complicated, but we've been dealing with it for 34 years, but that's the status. Helane Becker : Okay, okay. Well, thinks very much. We'll look forward tomorrow's boot from the flight attendants. Gary Kelly : Yes, indeed. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Joseph Denardi : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, I just want to clarify on the ROIC target, is the plan to no longer provide a longer-term target and if so, why is the year-to-year the right way to hand this? And then is the business being run to kind of ex-deal to hold margins flat or to grow them, I think, there's obviously a difference between the two? Tammy Romo : Well. I'm not sure how to answer your question. Gary Kelly : I think, this is complicated. I think given the current fuel price environment in the current industry environment, we are generating a substantial shareholder value well and in excess of our long-term 15% target. I think Tammy's only point is it, in the short-term, it sort of renders the whole 15% discussion moved. Because we're not targeting down to 15%, we won't do that for the next year. And with a little bit of to get fortune here will be many, many years of above the average returns on the capital, which is what we're striving for. So last year, we had a 21.2% return on the invested capital and our goal for 2015 was to beat that and thus far we are well ahead of that. So as we enter the fall, planning process for 2016, we will be straining to do the same thing again in 2016 to meet or beat or wherever we think we're going to end up here in 2015. We think that's the best way to grow shareholder value, if we can grow the business and on top of that grow the returns, it just provides very, very substantial shareholder returns. And that is our goal playing it simple. If fuel prices double between here and next year, that will make that an unrealistic goal in the short-term. It took us obviously a number of years to get adjusted to $100 crude oil. So hopefully that won't happen. We're trying to take steps, so that we don't see that kind of a shock for fuel prices back to the hedging discussion. But our goal for next year will be to continue to sustain very strong returns on capital. Joseph Denardi : Okay. And then Tammy, can you just give us what the no show fee revenue was in the quarter? Tammy Romo : Sure. Just give me one minute before that. I'll come back, if we have another question. Operator : We'll go ahead and move onto Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Wanted to come back to an earlier question about better than sequential revenue trends or better than normal seasonality. I forget the exact term. Can you just walk us through that again ex the deal and maybe playback the second quarter. Do you feel like there was yield softness and weakening closing yields. And if so when did that recover and is it something that you're seeing based on revenue that's booked in July or bookings for the rest of the quarter. Any additional commentary you can give us kind of excess to sort of accretive credit card deal would be great. Gary Kelly : Well, let me know your comments Tammy, you clean all this up, but Duane I assume you've been on the call the entire time, I know it's a busy morning for you all, but the \u2013 where I netted down the second quarter was, there was \"softness\" for us to the extent of about 1%, whether its 2%, whether its zero, it sometimes is a little hard to tease out, because there is a lot of noise in Southwest Airlines in 2015, there is a lot of things going on, there is a lot of change. So we've tried to tease all that out. The comps versus a year-ago in the second quarter, at least to me appeared to be harder versus 2014 than the third quarter. So you have that going on as well, but just pure sequentially, I think it was our feeling before the deal, that things were beginning to improve perhaps a little bit. I just don't feel like you can necessarily take that to the bank. So whatever improvement it is, I think is rather modest, and the majority of the improvements sequentially that we're reporting to you is the Chase deal. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Gary Kelly : The good news in what \u2013 at least what I was trying to explain with my remarks, my opening remarks is that to the extent that there is some softness, it doesn't feel to us like it's getting softer still. If anything it feels like we've seen a bit of the bottom and things are beginning to improve. But 90 days is a long time in our work. So a lot of things can change between now and September. But that's the way things feel right now and obviously the Chase \u2013 the Chase deal is pretty material. We've given you the numbers, so you can \u2013 you can do your own arithmetic if you want, but I think Tammy, you already said, it's $125 \u2013 $125 million a quarter. So you can kind of \u2013 I just can't do all the math, Duane, in my head, sitting here. Tammy anything do you want to add? Tammy Romo : Yeah. Duane, the only thing just to give as I mentioned earlier that the third quarter is trending up. And if I had to, it's probably about a point sequentially from the second quarter. And we are \u2013 we're continuing to see a very strong demand as Gary mentioned for low fares. And thus far in July including the Chase benefit, I would say, our July RASM is trending pretty much aligned with the last year. So while, it's a little difficult to tease all this out, I think, it's fair to say there is \u2013 the way I'm thinking of it is, we had some bad with the yield weakness in the second quarter, but trends have stabilized and I think improving a bit, so. Gary Kelly : Yeah. And again, so what I mean with a lot of noise and Tammy just said the same thing. These are all trends without us doing the deep analysis. So is our improvement because the economy is improving, is because our development markets are improving, is it Dallas, is it Washington Reagan, are we seeing more improvement in the international? All that has to be \u2013 it takes a while to understand and now we're talking about predicting trends in the future, where we don't have that in-depth understanding necessarily. So, I think, it feels to me like the economy is strengthening a bit, we keep up with it just like you do, and all of the weekly reports that I see are all \u2013 they're mixed, they're continuing to be mixed. I just read one this morning before our call, and it was yet another mix to report on, on current trends. So, it could be that it's just our own developing markets are improving, which would be welcome also. But in any event, whatever it is we are definitely seeing an improvement in our sequential trends and certainly because of the Chase contract. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thanks for that commentary. Gary Kelly : And I was just going to jump in with the notion of revenue that was $18 million for the quarter. Operator : And that does conclude the analyst Q&A portion of today's call. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Brand. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom and thank you all again for joining us today. And as always, I'll be available, if there are any follow up questions this afternoon. Operator : And that does conclude the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I would like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Outreach. Linda Rutherford : Good day everyone. Tom, if you could go ahead and give our members of the media instructions, on how to queue up for questions. We'll go ahead and get started. Operator : Yes. Ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And thank you for standing by. We'll take our first question from Terry Maxon with The Dallas Morning News. Terry Maxon : Afternoon, everybody. Gary Kelly : Good afternoon, Terry. Terry Maxon : Hey, Tammy set off of a great deal of excitement on May 19th when she gave the capacity estimates for your 2015 and 2016. Your numbers today instead of 7% to 8%, you're now at 7% for this year and 5% to 6% for this year instead of 6% to 7%. My question is, did you actually dial back capacity set more just a refinement of your estimates? Tammy Romo : Hi, Terry. Yes. We will \u2013 I think, it's both really. We were always working on schedule as we look forward. And what we were simply dealing at that time I think we had our schedule out. And it was \u2013 I mean, simply reporting on the schedule that we had published at that time. And given the weakness that we saw in May and June and particularly on the yield, and as we're getting closer to publishing our schedule, we are dialing back our capacity a bit just based on \u2013 based on the trends that we saw on the yield side in the second quarter. And then also as we're getting \u2013 as we're thinking about next year, what we do know is that the carryover impact in this year's capacity is and the \u2013 for next year then the 4% to 5% range. And then above that as we told you, we're expecting to grow 5% to 6%. So where we brought a lot here, over the past couple of years. So we want to certainly digest that growth, and as we're thinking about our international expansion, while what we're seeing so far is in line with expectations. It does take a little bit of what we're experiencing and it does take a little bit longer for those markets to mature. So we factor all of that in to our capacity plans and just based on our current outlook and where we're not \u2013 we dialed that back just a bit. But Terry, what I'd also point out to you at that time, we as always, we tweaked our schedule and react to the current business outlook. Terry Maxon : All right. Tammy Romo : The only thing I would add is \u2013 it's not really a macro discussion, it's really more of a bottoms up discussion. So we have airplanes that are available for us to put to work in the fleet, which is the source of our capacity increase really both years, 2015 and 2016. Although we're adding a few airplanes next year to the fleet. And as we were publishing the schedule, we have pushed the utilization in the first part of this year, which has squeezed some flights into what I'll describe as a non-peak time period and they are sometimes less than desirable flights. So there's some opportunities to cut those back as we are beginning to restore more and more aircraft back into flying. So we have some things going on like that. Secondly, and I mentioned this on the Analyst Call, our international is a true expansion and it carries risk. And so, our folks are monitoring very carefully the performance of those markets and we do not want to grow those new expansion markets too fast. So those are \u2013 we're managing the business as opposed to reacting to the May 19 scenario and we want to continue to hear out strong profits, strong margins and grow the airline at the right pace, whether it's 5%, 6% or 7%, we'll figure out what that right pace is and we'll try to make that as dynamic as possible knowing that the airline is fairly set in concrete for a while. It's tough for us to turn it on a dime but we certainly are continuing to evaluate our opportunity of 2016 and haven't made final decisions about the capacity yet. Terry Maxon : Okay. Tammy Romo : Again products \u2013 Terry, one thought as well, because I think what you were referring to was the capacity for this year. It really \u2013 we're talking decimal point. In term Terry Maxon : It's better to 10 points [indiscernible] Tammy Romo : And so, it is a lot of attention for rounding. Gary Kelly : 2016 our thoughts have moved more. They've moved up, we've moved down, Mike Van de Ven has operating needs for some airplanes, so \u2013 we are not fully baked with our plans for 2016 yet, but those are the parameters that we're operating under. Terry Maxon : Yeah, if the \u2013 on the capacity, I wondered further in fact you just rounded it a little bit differently, but when you're further out you are the vaguer the future is, but if I could follow up on our question that came up toward the end of the conference call with the analyst, the delta software situation, is it \u2013 do you anticipate operational issues once you do your August 9 and you've got 180 flights and there are five folded into one of your gates? Gary Kelly : Well, it's not going to be easy and our people are planning as best they can and they will work really hard to serve our customers well, so I think it will be incumbent upon all parties to be cooperative and levelheaded but yeah it's going to be crowded. Terry Maxon : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Nicas with Wall Street Journal. Jack Nicas : Good afternoon folks. Gary Kelly : Hi Jack. Jack Nicas : So can I ask this question, the DOJ is investigating Southwest and three other large U.S. airlines for possible collision on capacity, so what is \u2013 what's your take on this probe and how are you cooperating? Gary Kelly : Well, we're cooperating by doing what they told us to, so we're good at supplying information and we know how to do that and we're busy complying with that request. There has been a lot of talk and advice on and we don't want to continue to perpetuate that, but I'd \u2013 you'd have to ask the Department of Justice, what's actually [ph] spon their desire to investigate. But we're fully compliant, we compliant with all the anti-trust laws, and we compliant with all laws for that matter and certainly that with the Federal Securities Laws. At the same time, we are \u2013 if you go back to the Terry's question of Tammy in the May 19th conference, we're doing our best to be transparent with our investors and answer their questions. But our focus is on the Southwest Airlines and managing our business and would not commenting or making comments about our competitors. Jack Nicas : Okay. Thanks. And one other quick follow-up. Some of, I guess some of the analysts that have been on this call before over the past several months have criticized the industry and in some cases the Southwest for growing too quickly. And there is concerns among the analysts, concerns among the investors that capacity growth has been too rapid and jet fuel has been fueling that. Obviously, you've got a unique situation with Dallas Love Field, but what's your response to that criticism that you may be fueling too rapid of the growth to be sustainable and we may be going back into this moving bus cycle of the airline industry? Gary Kelly : It's incumbent upon us to manage our business. And Southwest Airlines has competitive strength and we want to take forward advantage of those. We're a low cost carrier. We have substantially lower cost than our legacy competitors do. And I think, what people miss is that, we have opportunities to grow that many of our competitors do not and Dallas Love Field is a perfect example of that. Houston Hobby International is another perfect example of that. So we have not grown Southwest Airlines in three or four years. So we have a history of being prudent and measured and how we approach our business. And certainly, would want to continue that into the future. But we have opportunities to grow like we haven't had in years and we absolutely will grow this airline, that is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we have a fiduciary duty to create shareholder value and take care of our shareholders and as well as our employees for that matter and that's what we intend to do. Jack Nicas : Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Andrea Ahles : Hi, good afternoon. Gary Kelly : Hi, Andrea. Andrea Ahles : I was wondering, if you talk a little bit more about Love Field and you'd be mentioned in the comments that, it's the markets that are doing well and obviously you're adding more in August. You had previously said that Love were at load factors about 90% on some of those at Love Field. Are you still seeing that sort of yield or did the softness in May and June also affect Love Field. And do you \u2013 and also do you think fares are going start going up on some of those in the Dallas routes, that you've added in the past year post writ. Gary Kelly : Andrea, I can report this. You're right, the things have changed since I told you that load factors at Love were 90%, they're now about 94%. Andrea Ahles : Okay. Gary Kelly : Very, very full and very, very popular and our folks are working very hard at Love Field and they're doing a great job. So I'm very pleased with the results, I can't talk about that, any future pricing as usual. But we've got very strong results, stimulated the market with lower fares, we provided a competition that we promised. And I don't know how it could be any better. Well, I do know how it can be better. And hopefully, we'll be better soon, because we'll have even more access to our gates that we have paid for, so that we can add even more low fare flights. That would.. Tammy Romo : I'm sorry. Do you expect Houston to \u2013 do you expect to grow Houston as quickly you have Dallas in terms of that opportunity with the international base, once [indiscernible] in October or are you're going to be more measured because there is more risk with the international hub? Gary Kelly : Not expect it to grow anywhere near as quickly. The potential is probably not \u2013 well, the potential is not nearly as great in terms of just sheer traffic and flights that you have compared to Dallas. But the theme is very similar, it is a market that is monopolized by one competitor with very high fares, and we will be able to go in finally and add some competition and significantly lower fares, and no doubt we'll simulate the market. Now, it is one thing for us to add flights between Dallas and New York or Washington or Chicago, better cities that we currently serve where the customers know us. As opposed to Houston, where we're now going to be adding the lease, which is of not only a city, but a country that is not familiar with Southwest Airlines, and probably doesn't drive an equivalent amount of traffic to United States. So the risk are different and we'll have to take that into account, and we will have more measured growth as an example with these international markets. Having said all that, we're still starting off with a nice bang. So I think we start off with nine daily departures, we're quickly adding a couple more this year. And we'll just continue to monitor the performance of those flights and evaluate whether we want to add more. Contrast that to Dallas Love Field and Bob, I think we will have added about 60 daily departures in one year \u2013 less than a year's time to Dallas. So we're not talking about 60 daily departures in Huston ever most likely, just to put in perspective. Andrea Ahles : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson : Good morning. Gary, I wonder if you could revisit for a minute in the website now down back in early June, what you've learned from it. What the real cause was in the past? Give us a sense of \u2013 can you quantify any financial impact from being down for a couple of days? Gary Kelly : Well. Dawn, good to hear from you. Yeah, I think the headline there, it was just an extraordinarily successful sale. But, Bob, by the way did a tremendous job of managing through that challenge. So Bob, any thought do you want to share there to Dawn's question? Robert Jordan : Well, Dawn, I think it shows you the power of a low fare. So we plan for these things as always we test and we were just overwhelmed with the demand the first couple of days. We did uncover some technical things that were fixed rapidly, but you just can't test everything. But really what is the demand coming to the side. At the end of the day, we decided to extend the sale by a day, which is a little abnormal for us and in totality, the sale performed better than we expected despite those two days that were an issue. So that last day in other word made up \u2013 more than made up for all of the issues in the bookings that we couldn't take those first couple of days. So at the end of the day despite the challenges, we know because our customers a lot of issues not being able to get into the website and we've really apologized for that. But at the end of the day, financially the sale was really good despite those issues. Dawn Gilbertson : Perfect. Robert Jordan : Welcome. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thanks, Tom and thank you all for being with us today. If the media has any follow-up questions, please let us know. You can call 214-792-4847 or of course send an inquiry to swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Operator : And this does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining.",

My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Marcy Brand : Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. And welcome to today's call to discuss third quarter 2015 results. Joining the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. At this time, I\u2019d like to go ahead and turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Marcy and good morning everybody and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call. We are celebrating, this is a terrific quarter and really a terrific year. I am very proud of all of our people, all 47,000 of them and I want to thank them and congratulate them on these stellar results. This is the culmination of years of hard work on their part as well as daily dedication to running a great airline and taking great care of our customers.  While it is true that the majority of the 71% surge in our earnings-per-share was due to a dramatic drop in jet fuel prices, there are a lot of other good things happening in this quarter. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to grow in terms of members and revenues and obviously the amended credit card deal is a highlight for the quarter and for future years.  Next, our core passenger business overall is solid and steady and that's despite the very brisk competitive environment that we find ourselves in. I'm especially pleased with our record load factor and record revenues considering the aggressive Dallas, Love Field expansion, the transition of the AirTran markets this year, the slot acquisitions at DCA and LaGuardia and our continuing international expansion. Next, our cost performance was also very good. Profit sharing was up significantly and of course that\u2019s a very good thing. Our nine-month accrual for profit sharing was a record $484 million and well earned by our people and of course they too are benefiting from dramatically lower fuel prices.  As far as the year 2015 goes, I just want to recap our plan for a perspective. This year is a confluence of events, some planned and some not but the result is spectacular. We have significant opportunities to expand, Dallas, Love Field, Washington Reagan, LaGuardia International, Houston International all converging here in 2015.  While we have significant opportunities, we also have significant access to low-cost incremental capacity to pursue these opportunities and that\u2019s through the restoration of our aircraft utilization to more historic levels and our fleet over the last several years has been underutilized as we\u2019ve been going through the merger process.  And then finally with dramatically lower fuel prices, we have the cushion to mitigate this expansion risk and actually been very fortunate to help \u2013 have that help to drive record profits at the same time that we\u2019re growing. So we\u2019ve been able to significantly augment our revenue production this year also with the amended credit card deal.  So all this has supported our growth plan of 7% in ASMs for 2015 and still resulted in record earnings and returns and our plans for 2016 are unchanged from our previous guidance. We are expecting unit revenue growth year-over-year in fourth quarter \u201815 which has been an improvement from the third quarter and that's primarily because our developing markets are continuing to mature rapidly. So we expect to end this year with roughly 700 airplanes and add roughly 15 aircraft next year, again for an available seat mile growth of between 5% and 6%.  So the work over the last five years in particular has come together exceptionally well. We\u2019re exceptionally well positioned for future growth and that will continue dependent upon our continued success with our low fare brand which of course is built with low-cost and our transparency and we\u2019re exceptionally well-positioned for future growth but also dependent upon our continued success with our customer service and especially the hospitality of our people which is something that Southwest is beloved by our customers for.  So with that brief overview, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tammy Romo, our CFO who will take us through the quarterly results. Tammy Romo : Thanks, Gary and welcome everyone. We are pleased to report incredibly strong third quarter results marked by many records.  Our third-quarter earnings excluding special items were a record $623 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 71% over last year\u2019s $0.55 per diluted share. Our GAAP net income was $584 million, including $39 million in special items. In addition to our usual special items related to out of period fuel hedging adjustments, we had two other large special items this quarter. First, we recorded an expense of $140 million associated with the tentative agreement with our pilots in accordance with accounting guidance, and second, as we discussed last quarter, we had a special revenue item of $172 million related to the required change in accounting methodology as a result of our amended credit card agreement with Chase. That was effective in July.  Our operating income excluding special items was a third quarter record $1 billion which produced nearly a 700 basis point improvement in operating margin of 20.3%. And to top up these records, we produced a 12-month trailing pre-tax return on invested capital, excluding special items, of 31.1%. So congratulations to all of our terrific employees on this outstanding achievement. Total operating revenues in the third quarter, also a record, were $5.3 billion, up 10.8% year over year on a capacity increase of 7.6%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.7 billion. Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter resulting in nearly 9% growth in traffic and an all time quarterly high record low factor. The yield environment remained but stabilized and sequentially our third quarter unit revenue trends were above average driven by our credit card agreement with Chase, which again was amended in July.  Our third quarter operating revenues included a $300 million from the amended Chase contract and resulting change in accounting. Included in that benefit was a one-time non-cash adjustment of $172 million, that reduced the deferred revenue liability and thereby increased revenue. This was recorded as a special revenue adjustment and was excluded from the RASM that we reported. The remaining $130 million incremental benefit was due to the improved economics of the co-brand contracts and required accounting treatment combined. This $130 million benefit was about a 2 to 3 point improvement to RASM and we expect a similar benefit in fourth quarter 2015 which is incorporated with the guidance. I will discuss here with you shortly. With the amended agreement with Chase and change in accounting treatment, our third quarter 2015 passenger revenues would have been $40 million higher and our other revenues would have been $170 million lower for a net incremental reduction to operating revenues of $130 million and of course we wouldn\u2019t have had the $172 million special revenue adjustment.  As Gary said, our Rapid Rewards program overall is a huge success and continue to contribute a significant incremental revenue year over year. On a unit basis, our third quarter operating revenues declined 0.4% on a 7.6% capacity increase and we are pleased with this very solid performance especially considering the impact of increased station scheduling which impacted our third quarter year-over-year unit revenues by about two points, as well as the high percentage of development markets which impacted year-over-year unit revenues by an additional point.  For third quarter about 18% of our network was under development. We are delighted as we have been talking about here for some time with the performance of these new markets which are performing at or above our expectation and Dallas continues to outperform the systems margins and returns with a robust demand in all facets of our Dallas growth. International is also developing as planned and again very excited to begin international service out of Houston last week.  So looking ahead to fourth quarter, so far demand for our low fares remains strong. Based on our current bookings and revenue trends we are estimating fourth quarter RASM will increase approximately 1% year over year, including about a $130 million estimated benefit from the Chase agreement and corresponding change in accounting treatment.  Considering the estimated 2 percentage point impact of more stage engaged as well as another point impact from 12% of our network under development, all year-over-year we are very pleased with our fourth quarter revenue outlook.  Turning to freight and other revenues, we are also very pleased there and we currently expect our fourth quarter freight revenues to be comparable to third quarter this year and as I discussed previously, other revenues increased significantly year-over-year and that was largely due to the amended Chase agreement. And in addition to certain ancillary revenues such as EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding, those were also strong contributors to our other revenue growth. The growth in such ancillary revenues completely offset the loss of AirTran\u2019s ancillary revenues, so we were \u2013 again just a strong performance from the ancillary revenue side.  We expect another significant year-over-year increase in fourth quarter 2015 other revenues largely due to the combined impact of the Chase agreement and required accounting treatment change.  So now I will walk through our cost performance briefly. Third quarter unit costs excluding special items decreased approximately 8% year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control particularly fleet modernization. Our economic fuel costs decreased almost $300 million year-over-year driven by the 25% decline in fuel prices and an improvement in fuel burn. Our fuel price per gallon declined $0.74 to $2.20 versus $2.94 in third quarter of last year. And our third-quarter fuel burn improved 1.8% year-over-year reducing our third-quarter fuel costs by approximately 80 million and we are on track to achieve our target of at least 74 that we mentioned in last November at our investor day.  Based on our hedge position and market price just as of Monday we expect our fourth quarter \u201815 fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.05 to $2.10 range which is well below fourth quarter last year\u2019s $2.62 per gallon. And since last fall, we -- just remind everybody, we\u2019ve significantly participated in the market decline and we currently expect 2015 economic fuel costs to decline approximately $1.3 billion over last year. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were up less than a percent which was largely driven by the 77% year-over-year increase in profit sharing and our profit sharing expense increase is a record 484 million as Gary mentioned. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs decreased 1.6% year-over-year which way better than expected due to some cents particularly in advertising and technology related to project costs that had been shifted to fourth quarter 2015 and better-than-expected airport costs.  Our modernization remains on track to produce an estimated 700 million EBIT this year even with the drop in fuel prices. Based on current cost trends we expect total fourth quarter unit cost excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing to be comparable to fourth quarter last year\u2019s $0.0822.  Now I will move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our investment grade balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong and we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our free cash flow was $1.6 billion with $583 million in third quarter alone. Our very strong cash flow generation has allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return significant value back to our shareholders while we continue to reinvest prudently in our business.  During the third quarter we repurchased 500 million in common stock which brings our share repurchases this year to nearly 1.2 billion thus far. We received approximately 9.7 million shares under the $500 million accelerated share repurchase during -- and we expected to receive the remaining 25% of total shares expected by the end of this month. We currently have 700 million remaining of the 1.5 billion repurchase program that was authorized in May of this year. We\u2019ve also repaid $170 million in debt and capital lease obligations thus far this year and our leverage including off-balance-sheet aircraft leases is in the low to mid 30% range. We continue to estimate our 2015 capital spend to be approximately $1.8 million and that excludes assets constructed for others which is estimated to be in the 50 million to 100 million range and that includes approximately 1.1 billion in aircraft spend. And for 2016 we continue to estimate aircraft spend in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range with total CapEx estimated to be roughly $2 billion.  Turning to our fleet plans for just a quick minute. We ended third quarter with 692 aircraft in our fleet and continue to expect our fleet to end with roughly 700 by the end of this year. And regarding capacity, our fourth quarter available seat miles are estimated to increase year-over-year approximately 8.5% on year-over-year seat growth of 4.4%.  Our full year capacity growth remains on pace to increase approximately 7% year-over-year with the seat growing only 2.9% year-over-year which as you all know is driven in large part by Dallas\u2019 new non-stop \u2013 longer haul flying and also on Washington Reagan, LaGuardia and our new international markets.  Our 2016 growth plans haven\u2019t changed, as Gary said, and we continue to expect to grow our available seat miles for the full year in the 5% to 6% range versus 2015 and as a reminder the vast majority of 2016\u2019s growth will simply be the annualized impact of 2015 capacity additions that we discussed.  So in conclusion, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with our results this quarter. Substantially lower fuel prices along with solid revenues and cost controls produced a record earnings and our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and we continue to be disciplined with our approach to capital allocation as evidenced by a very strong return on invested capital.  So with that brief overview, I would like to close again by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and outstanding contributions to these strong results. Tom, with that, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now begin with our first question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Just on the growth opportunity, I\u2019d like to discuss \u2013 and you\u2019ve kind of talked about things, still being a substantial and a domestic growth opportunity here. I was wondering, does that come from just routes that you are not in today that you want to add or is it more from just increasing frequency and gaining share in the markets that you are in today, outside of what we see happen in Dallas? Gary Kelly : We have 85 domestic mainland 48 state destinations today. I don't believe we have many more dots that we can add to the route map, so that\u2019s first part of the answer. Among the 85 we have a variety of opportunities to add non-stop segments and especially in short haul markets if those markets begin to return to pre 2000 traffic levels we will have a lot of opportunities to add frequencies in those markets as examples. Savi Syth : And I guess you\u2019ve also talked about \u2013 I think I see new [ph] and articles talking about the potential to gain share in the long haul market, now again going to Dallas, I understand that was kind of an artificial kind of holding back in that market but wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on -- your comment on long haul market, market share opportunity and why maybe Southwest is lagging there and how you kind of ago about increasing that market share? Gary Kelly : Savi, ,I think what you are picking up there was an interview that was done with Fortune and I really think that\u2019s old news, so that article was really recounting where we\u2019ve come over the last decade, so that was much more of a story 10 or 15 years ago. Today we are very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made, you are very familiar with the initiatives that we\u2019ve been working on over the last five years. So I think prospectively that would not be our messaging today that we believe that we can gain share in long haul markets.  Now in terms of the expansion opportunities that we have, just geographically, since we\u2019re just now getting started flying trans-border, obviously those will be long haul opportunities but that's really more a function of us building off of our domestic base having a very small presence internationally and having a lot of potential destinations that we can add to our route map. So we are pleased with the customer experience as we have it today. We are very pleased with the market performance whether it\u2019s long, medium or short and we are happy to have the 737-800 as a component of our fleet. It\u2019s just performing exceptionally well. Savi Syth : And if just may, what I am trying to understanding, Gary, is just the opportunity growth 5% to 6% type levels in the future. I am trying to understand is how much of that comes from domestic, I know the past commentary on international has been more of kind of slow growth and it\u2019s 1% of ASM, so it\u2019s a small base. Just trying to figure out, as you look out over the next three, four years even, just how the growth will be \u2013 what\u2019s the composition of the growth and what level of growth is reasonable for Southwest? Gary Kelly : Well, the only guidance I can give you on the growth rate is for 2016 and there we\u2019re going to grow 5% to 6%. Next year, about a point or two of that will be international and beyond that we will just take that on a year-to-year basis and we will pursue the opportunities that are the most advantageous for us. Over time I think that most of our growth opportunities in the future will skew towards domestic but clearly most of these, virtually all of the new destinations will be international. But we are not operating under a route target either way. We've got decisions that we\u2019re making still even for 2016 as to what we want to do with the additional capacities that we are adding next year. So again as Tammy has already pointed out, there is not much new plan for 2016 anyway because most of it is just going to be the full year effect of decisions that you are already familiar with here in 2015. Operator : And we will take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Realize it\u2019s little early to comment on 2016 unit cost trends, can you offer any color at least directionally on what we should expect in 2016 assuming the pilot deal is ratified and can we look at the Q4 run rate of flat as a good proxy? Tammy Romo : And Julie, you were breaking up a little bit there but I believe that you were asking about our 2016 cost performance, if I picked your question up right, is that correct? Julie Yates : Correct. Yes, I just said it, I know it\u2019s a little early but can you offer any color directionally assuming that the pilot deal is ratified and can we look at the Q4 run rate of flat as a good proxy as we move into next year? Tammy Romo : Sure. I can provide a little bit of color but we are still working through our 2016 plans, so I am not prepared to give you cost guidance here today. But just a couple of items of note, as you are thinking through 2016, while I would expect ongoing benefit from our fleet modernization effort, I wouldn\u2019t expect the year-over-year impact to be as significant as this year since we are passing anniversary of 717 so we still get some benefit there. I\u2019d also anticipate some cost pressures particularly salary raises and benefits, I think you noted and in addition, while we aren\u2019t prepared to provide an implementation date of our reservation system until we get past a couple of milestones here, I would encourage you to keep in mind that we would expect to have some training costs associated with that implementation as well. So but as always, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated year in, year out that we are very diligent when it comes to our cost control effort and we will work hard here and 2016 but until we have completed our planning effort here for 2016, I will hold off on giving you any specific guidance until later this year. Julie Yates : I mean to be clear, is that going to be later this year or will that be in January with Q4? Tammy Romo : Well, it may be with Q4 with earnings, I don\u2019t know, Julie, well but it will be later, I am just not prepared here today to give you specific guidance yet simply because we are still working through our plans with respect to cost for 2016. Mike Van de Ven : Julie, the only thing I was going to add to what Tammy said is that again to be clear, with the pilot tentative agreement, if that is ratified, that will be a cost for that work group, that will be a cost increase next year but that is an investment in our people, it\u2019s an investment in Southwest Airlines, it gives us certainty that we can plan around and obviously our objective here is to work together to grow Southwest Airlines. So obviously we\u2019re very pleased to have the tentative agreement and we should know the results of that voting here in I guess two weeks. Julie Yates : Gary, let me ask you something we had talked about I think during the headquarters back in May, about you guys continuing to focus on expanding your fundamental margins. And so you are doing that again in the fourth quarter now that your RASM is back to positive and your costs are flat. Looking into next year, would you expect the spread for RASM to exceed the growth in CASM? Gary Kelly : That will clearly be the target in that I would just again defer to Tammy and repeat what she said which is once we are ready we will provide the cost outlook for next year but part of the strategy with our growth in \u201915 and \u201916 is to allow this large percentage of markets that are under development, give them a chance to mature next year, so the percentage of markets under development a year from now, I think, Bob, will be in about the 5% range -- Bob Jordan : Yes. Gary Kelly : So clearly we are well set on expectations for some tailwinds here with the RASM improvement and do the best job we can to match that up with some of the cost pressures that Tammy has referred to for next year. But clearly that will be our objective. Tammy Romo : And Julie, the only other thing I would add to that, just keep in mind, we will have a full year impact from the Chase agreement. So just make sure to factor that into your thought as you are thinking about next year. Gary Kelly : And you all, I know, will take some time to evaluate our revenue results but there is quite a bit of noise in those numbers. They look very solid today, whether you tease apart, the increase in the stage length, the increase in the gauge, some of the effective reclassification for accounting purposes for passenger revenues to other, there is quite a bit of noise there and it looks very good. So it\u2019s just helpful that even with the noise the fourth quarter number shows a positive, so you don\u2019t have to go through a lot of this analysis but if you are careful and you look at the analysis, I think you will be pretty impressed with the revenue performance here in the third quarter also. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Just first on capacity growth as you look at next year, can you just talk about that cadence and maybe compare that the beginning of the year going towards maybe the end of the year? Tammy Romo : In terms of just the capacity, Rajeev, yes, you will see similar \u2013 in terms of ASM growth you will see similar trends in the first quarter as you are seeing here in the fourth quarter, and then it will obviously taper out as we go through the year. Rajeev Lalwani : And then just continuing on a lot of comment around the revenue environment, I was just hoping to get more color, Gary touched on sort of competitive environment, so just to get your thoughts on sort of what makes that calm down going forward, is it fuel, is it just lapping certain dynamics, just your thoughts there would be great? Gary Kelly : Well, I am chuckling because you are talking about competition in the industry et cetera, so we are doing well in this environment, we are a low cost carrier, we are a low fare brand and we are growing and we love the competition and we love being pro-consumer. So I think we will continue to manage our growth according to our ability to generate appropriate returns and we\u2019re going to continue to work very hard to deliver on our low fare brand promise to our customers. So low fares is our specialty and our business and we\u2019ve been profitable for 42 years with that, so I would expect that will continue. Operator : And we will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : So Gary, you\u2019ve got a couple things going on, I guess, you\u2019ve got some new IT on the merchandising side and at the same time your average stage length continues to increase. And I just wondered if you could give us some updated thoughts on, any perhaps big picture kind of changes to the product positioning that you are concerned currently and others, been various questions asked on this topic over the years, which is wondering kind of how you are thinking currently about, things like perhaps doing a premium economy, perhaps plugging in more of a seat selection ability in the main cabin, those types of opportunities, anything you could say would be helpful? Gary Kelly : You bet, and again thanks for the question there. So and you are right, we are continuing to invest in the company in various ways, so we have investments underway that are physical in nature in terms of airport capacity, we just opened up Houston Hobby, we\u2019ve got a large project underway at LAX, we\u2019ve got a large project underway at Fort Lauderdale which will create international flying capability there. So that\u2019s one thing that we are doing that I think fits in somewhat with your question.  From a technology perspective, we are replacing our reservation system but there is a broader commercial agenda that will roll out, Bob, over the next five years, I would say, lot of it will come on line sooner than that. But that will give us significantly updated capabilities to pursue our commercial goals, and then thirdly, we also have a similarly large agenda with Mike Van de Ven and his team on the operations side of the house. So there is a lot of infrastructure investment taking place. There is a lot of infrastructure spending by the way that will be occurring in 2016, so that will be something that Tammy will want to share when we are ready here at a future date. We are excited about all of that.  With respect to the customer experience, there is no question that we will have better tools in the future to make more tactical decisions in terms of changes to the current approach. Having said that, and looking at the current results and our expectation for 2016, I am very happy with our customer experience and our focus right now is very much on the basics. It is using the tools that we have to improve the reliability of our operation and also to invest in our people to improve the hospitality of our customer service, and that we can do without new technology and it\u2019s something that we are very excited about, the technology I think will certainly enhance our ability to better execute against those two goals. But we are really happy with the product that we have right now. I think we\u2019ve actually got opportunities to improve further and the kinds of considerations that you are asking for, I think, something that we can think about in the future but we have no plans to make any changes that are material along those lines. Darryl Genovesi : And then Tammy, on the fuel hedge margin, it looks like you reversed about half of what you had posted last quarter, I think it looks like you\u2019ve got about $200 million left. Should that come through in Q4? Tammy Romo : Yes, that\u2019s correct. We provided you the liability and for the remainder of 2015 I want to say that in the 100 million to 125 million range, I think it was 116 million. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays. David Fintzen : Question on the Wright Amendment and flying, now that you\u2019ve got \u2013 I guess, about a year thereabout, do you view the new flying as markets that have sort of jump started the typical market development cycle where you\u2019re going to get to that 18 to 24 months processing you got there quite fast, or do you think it\u2019s sort of these markets from here developed \u2013 like they are not finished developing that continue to go? Gary Kelly : It\u2019s both. First of all, we\u2019ve never had anything like this. It\u2019s a pretty unique \u2013 well it\u2019s a very unique scenario and we were already in those markets already and had a lot of customers and I know you know all of this. So that clearly gave us a head-start and it allowed us in terms of our planning, if you go back 12 months before the launch of these flights, it allowed us to be more bold and more aggressive and just believing that those flights wouldn\u2019t be a drag on our earnings, as we were \u2013 our objective for 2013, \u201914 and \u201915 was to hit our earnings targets and we\u2019ve done that. Having said that, while they\u2019ve out of the box virtually every flight, not literally but the almost every flight has been very successful financially. They are still developing, I mean any \u2013 as you know, our flight activity is up 50%, I believe the available seat mile capacity is up 188%. We all know that is huge and there are bound to be some imperfections there that need to be tuned. So we will continue to look at our schedule and we will continue to look at our revenue management and with the idea that we will continue to improve from here. But it is with the understanding that \u2013 and we\u2019ve been very clear about this of the financial performance out of Dallas has been superb from day one. So the improvement may not be as sharp in those markets as it will be in some others but nonetheless I absolutely would expect that we will continue to see improvement from that capacity. David Fintzen : And just maybe a quick one in terms of \u2013 couple of weeks from new we find out about the TA, if it is voted down, how does the CASM guide change for the fourth quarter? Tammy Romo : We will \u2013 if there is any change to our guidance, we will just update you as appropriate later this quarter. Gary Kelly : And the first \u2013 just trying to help you a little bit here, that you don\u2019t get a full quarter change because \u2013 and think about the fourth quarter, because the effective pay rate change date is November 1, Mike, if I remember right. So it\u2019s not the \u2013 we would have a full quarter effect of the pay increase in the fourth quarter. David Fintzen : And in terms of how the contract is implemented, are there other things that sort of \u2013 from a crew planning standpoint et cetera that, sort of hit you cost wise upfront that you kind of manage over time or is it once the sort of contract goes in, that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 that\u2019s right run rate on the pilot side? Gary Kelly : Again, I think we will need to win that is all certain one way or the other. I think we will need to go into the effects of the contract. But at least for the time being you\u2019ve got good guidance from Southwest on the fourth quarter cost outlook. We booked the accrual for the bonus and with that we are assuming in our guidance that the agreement is ratified. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Just two quick ones here. Tammy, the next year\u2019s growth of 5% to 6% ASMs, do you have a \u2013 what percent on departures, I think you gave us departure growth for the fourth quarter and then the new Houston International terminal and it looks like you have been adding international flights from some other markets, how should we think about what part of that is international, split between international and domestic? Tammy Romo : For 2016? Michael Linenberg : Yes, 2016. Tammy Romo : Most of that\u2019s going \u2013 it\u2019s going to be weighted obviously towards domestic, so a small, I guess, probably call a point or so would be international and rest of that would be domestic. Michael Linenberg : And then just the departure growth rate? Tammy Romo : Yes. Our seats \u2013 we are expecting those to be up \u2013 somewhere, 3.5, call it, 3.5%, 3.6% and that is going to \u2013 of course Dallas, LaGuardia and Reagan National and that\u2019s call it probably half of that, and then the remainder with the other \u2013 just regional additions that we make here this year. Michael Linenberg : And just second question, I caught it somewhere in the press, I think it was reported that you paid $120 million to get access to the Love Field gates, so I was just wondering maybe if you could talk about how you got to that share value and whether or not \u2013 I mean do you have exclusivity of those gates or will you have to accommodate Delta, what\u2019s the story there? Gary Kelly : Well, I will answer the question, Mike and I just want to recognize that we are under a gag order from the federal judge on this case. So I am going to be very careful not to \u2013 not comply with his order. But the value was pretty straightforward, we simply looked at the equivalent values for slot controlled airports, slots are readily traded, and I would argue to you that there is no more effectively slot controlled airport in the United States than Dallas, Love Field. So it was pretty straightforward on how we arrived at that value and obviously you heard our results from Love Field.  With respect to the exclusivity, this sub-lease operates like any other airport lease where, yes, we do have preferential rights to the gates and then are required to make reasonable accommodation which simply means if you have room available, then you can\u2019t prohibit someone from using the gates and that\u2019s the way it works, that\u2019s where it works at Love Field, that\u2019s the way it works everywhere. Obviously there is no room at Love Field for anybody other than Southwest on our gates, by the way we are operating. Tammy Romo : Again, Mike, just one clarification, the numbers I gave you are for a carryover and it wasn\u2019t clear if your question was carryover or in total, but it\u2019s not going to move a lot, it\u2019s probably somewhere in that 4%, the seats are probably somewhere in the 4% growth range. Operator : We will take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : We all think of Dallas as being Dallas obviously, that is very competitive, and the reality is two different airports there and at times they behave like different markets. So I love to hear what you guys have discovered as the Wright Amendment route is still up about the competitive dynamics in Dallas. In terms of sort of when Love Field and DFW truly compete with each other and maybe when they don\u2019t as in maybe does the competitiveness become a little bit less important during trough period travel times, and are there times maybe these two airports may be distinct to \u2013 more distinct to one another than maybe a lot of people realize it at a high level, anything you can share of your experience are appreciated. Gary Kelly : I would be happy to. I would say more than any other dual or multiple airport market that I can think of, they operate as one airport, and they have \u2013 I have been here for 30 years and they always have. So the prices are matched, they are matched, obviously when it\u2019s Swiss Airlines leaving in the market, it\u2019s been rate historically to have any low fare offering at DFW because of the dominance of that airport. So really it was left to Southwest in this market to provide that low fare competition. That changed materially in 2006 when President Bush signed the Wright Amendment compromise because we could then begin offering itineraries beyond the Wright Amendment area and you saw prices come down significantly. Now we are able of course after 2014 to fly those markets non-stop and so there are more seats available at lower fares, you\u2019re seeing the increase in traffic not just at low but by virtue of that increased competition over DFW. What we\u2019ve typically seen over a 30-year period is as we\u2019ve grown with a focus on local traffic, the hub and spoke carriers and especially in DFW began to de-emphasize that and shift their focus to flow traffic which is why in the old days you\u2019d say one-third of the flight is coming from Southwest, one third from the City Pair, one-third from Delta, one-third from American and Southwest would have two-thirds of the traffic on that segment. Dallas, Houston was my all time favourite example, and that phenomenon continued more and more and more because they simply could not compete effectively with our cost on those \u2013 especially those short haul segment. So they absolutely compete, I talk to customers here in the DFW area all the time who tell me that they choose between DFW and Southwest for various reasons, or rather Love Field for various reasons and \u2013 I mean the same situation, I can drive to DFW just as fast as I can drive to Love Field, and obviously I drive to Love Field but they are very close together and it is much more of a single market than Houston as an example, or the Washington DC area, maybe it\u2019s more akin to the Bay Area where Oakland and SFO I think are pretty inter-changeable but it operates as one market. Hunter Keay : And then as it relates to fuel hedging, Tammy, can you talk about some of the risk parameters that you guys put in place when you think about taking out a hedge position and how much you\u2019re willing to absolute in terms of not just premium expenses in terms of sort of downside and upside and collateral being posted, what are the risk parameters you use when putting on hedges and when you make unfortunate hedging choices, is there a level of accountability that exists within your department, if the bet \u2013 if the wrong choice is made? Tammy Romo : I\u2019d be happy to walk you through that, Hunter. As you are aware, fuel represents one of our largest expenses, these are our first or second and it\u2019s really pretty straightforward. Our fuel hedging program is designed to provide an insurance when prices are rising. Obviously when prices are low, that\u2019s not as great of a risk and I think this quarter is evidence of that where we are producing very nice earnings. So we really look at our fuel hedging to help us mitigate the impact of the volatile swings that we see in fuel prices and just provide us at least a little more certainty with respect to what kind of fuel spikes we might have as we are planning for the future. So in terms of what do we think about, I think it\u2019s all the things that you would expect us to, we certainly do consider our balance sheet in determining how much risk we\u2019re able to absorb either on the high side or the low side, with respect to risk that we might be willing to accept with on the floor side. But that\u2019s simply what we do. We really do a lot of scenario planning to make sure that we are comfortable with the possible prices \u2013 possible fluctuations in fuel as we work through our plan. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight. So we are looking up and down the curve to make sure that we\u2019re comfortable when prices are high as well as when prices are low. Operator : And we will take our next question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Joseph Denardi : Gary, I think in that Fortune interview you also talked about potentially getting to a 90% load factor within five years. So I am wondering if that\u2019s how you are managing the airline whether Southwest can handle that operationally and whether you have the appropriate ancillary revenue stream to have that strategy make sense? Gary Kelly : To be honest with you, I don\u2019t remember saying that. You might be right. Mike Van de Ven sitting next to me is about to punch me saying that, but I don\u2019t know \u2013 honestly I don\u2019t know if 90% is a realistic number or not, I really don\u2019t know the context of the statement. But today -- I will answer it today, rather than trying to reconcile or whatever is in that article. Last year, Mike, we were an 83% annual load factor, that is 15 points higher than what we produced 15 years ago in the year 2000, and a lot of that increase \u2013 of course, it\u2019s all been necessary that we\u2019ve had economic imperatives to adjust our schedule to have fewer empty seats, we are also carrying more connecting passengers, still heavily weighted towards non-stop passengers but I think that, that\u2019s all important background to think about your question. We lag the industry, think a lot of our employees believe that we are the highest low factor, but actually we lag in the industry because we don\u2019t hub and spoke and we don\u2019t schedule so intentionally for connecting customers. We\u2019ve had not more of that way in recent years but not nearly as much as the rest of the industry. So it seems to me unless we continue to evolve more towards trying to fill airplanes up with connections, we are going to be somewhere here in the low 80s, we are running a bit ahead this year over year ago, we just had a record low factor for the third quarter which was at 85%, that was up one point versus a year ago, it feels like we will probably beat last year\u2019s 83%-ish 2014 load factor, Mike, that we had, so I think we can kind of inch things along from here and I am happy at these levels, as long as the rest of our economics continue to be successful. So one of the things that we\u2019ve tried to do over the last five to 10 years is have more customers per departure, so we would be relying less on having to raise our fares. That\u2019s a great way to increase revenues and still keep our fares low. And obviously we\u2019re getting closer to the point where that may not be as achievable. I think we have opportunities to manage our revenues better with revenue management techniques that\u2019s one of the things that will come with our new reservation system and by adding value in areas like our frequent flier program. So very pleased with the improvement that we\u2019ve seen with our credit card compensation there. So we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our unit revenues and I think for the most part that will need to come from optimizing our route network and less so in terms of trying to fill more empty seats. Joseph Denardi : And then I think at the investor day you also said that once you get beyond 2015, the growth out of Love that you see yourselves as a low single digit type grower domestically. Is that still the case or has that changed at all? Gary Kelly : I am sorry, I was thinking about your question, so is the question about our domestic growth opportunities to grow beyond Love Field? Well, no, I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 we have a large opportunity to grow, it depends upon a number of things, it depends on fuel prices, fares, the economy, all things that you know, depends on our competition, but as we see things today, there are more than ample opportunities to grow domestically, and as I have said many many times, we will want to grow in a sensible way and we want to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, we maintain hitting our profit targets, our return targets but it is important to grow, it\u2019s important to keep the customers that we have. We will need to continue to add service to meet their needs as long as the traffic is growing. So not growing is obviously not \u2013 it\u2019s not a good alternative but as the domestic economy continues to grow and especially if the short haul traffic continues to rebuild as \u2013 some of the early signs we\u2019ve seen here 2015, then we will have ample opportunities to grow. I am reluctant to put a number on it. Whatever I say really doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re going to grow at the rate that is justified by our financial parameters as well as the demand in the marketplace. And if we are lucky to have growth opportunities like we\u2019re experiencing right now out of Dallas, out of Washington, out of Houston International, then that will be fantastic and we will grow and we will manage it and we will continue hopefully to have a record earnings, that would be our goal. Joseph Denardi : And then just a quick one, Tammy, can you provide what the no-show fee revenue was in the quarter? Tammy Romo : Sure, I\u2019d be happy to pull that for you. It was 16 million for third quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Only two from me, I am not going to ask you six or seven. So on the other revenue line, it looks like you increased nicely even excluding the new credit card agreement. Can you just talk about what is driving that and trends you expect going forward? Tammy Romo : Yes. As I mentioned \u2013 as opened the call, we have had a nice growth in our ancillary revenue, obviously the Chase agreement is benefitting significantly in the other revenue line. So that\u2019s going to be the large \u2013 that\u2019s going to be the biggest piece of that, Duane. And we also had a freight \u2013 freight and others are also performing well, so we were actually quite pleased because our ancillaries offset as you know, we had the AirTran back seats coming off that we were pleased that that, offset our revenue but it\u2019s primarily the Chase agreement and in addition we had a nice showing with EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding, those are also contributors to our other revenue growth, and I think those are really the headlines.  And one other note is just charters, we also had a very strong growth during the third quarter as well. I think our charters were up in the 20% to 30% range. Gary Kelly : Duane, again just I am saying the same thing Tammy is but the Chase deal \u2013 if I do my arithmetic here right, accounts for all that about 25 million of the increase. So there is a $40 million adjustment out of passenger into other, in addition to the 130 million that we\u2019ve been talking about, for the third quarter. So there is actually 170 million in other. Duane Pfennigwerth : I think the trick was to get beyond AirTran because it was shrinking for a while and now it looks like it\u2019s growing even ex this deal. And then on the domestic res migration, it sounds like you are messaging little bit on the cost side, the things that we can sort of look forward to on the revenue side levers that you haven\u2019t pulled yet, can you give any update there, is it 2017, is it 2018, when can we start to get excited about the new levers that you haven\u2019t pulled yet? Thanks for taking the questions. Gary Kelly : Well, I am thinking to myself about the new levers that you must be referring to. In terms of the levers that we have been talking about, I think it\u2019s primarily our new reservation system, with some enhanced revenue management capabilities, so I will let Tammy talk about that. But beyond that \u2013 and she has already made this point \u2013 you get the full year benefit of the new credit card deal which is something we are excited about for next year, and then we are working really hard to mature our route network, it\u2019s gone through a lot of change over the last couple of years, we are absolutely expecting that we are going to drive more performance from that especially with the maturing of the developing markets. But Tammy, anything else you can add there? Tammy Romo : No, I really don\u2019t have much to add to that. The first phase of that, I agree, would be the revenue management opportunity and just continuing to optimize the network, and then as we get past \u2013 turning on our new reservation system, we will certainly provide a more insight at that time. Duane Pfennigwerth : So when we would you expect it to turn on, is that a \u201916 event? Tammy Romo : We have not given the exact date yet but what we have said is that we will be on our current reservation through the end of 2016 and we have transitioned the systems beyond that. So we\u2019re getting closer, so just stay tuned and we will be back in probably not too much longer with more details on the timeline, but we\u2019re just not ready to lay out \u2013 all of that out for you today. Operator : That concludes the analyst portion of today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Outreach. Linda Rutherford : Good day everyone. We\u2019ll just jump straight to the questions, so Tom, if you could instruct them on how to queue up, we will get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Lindenberger with Dallas Morning News. Michael Lindenberger : I mean I wanted to ask you \u2013 you saved a lot of money on fuel and you\u2019ve made a lot of efforts to try to keep your prices low by finding other revenue, I guess, by volume. Is there any calculation that you ought to invest some of these savings rather than share buybacks but in more aggressive pricing to drive up your volume and just sort of give the flying public the benefit that you guys have been sharing with your shareholders currently? Gary Kelly : Well, first of all, we want to be America\u2019s low fare leader and I think that we are. We are the only \u2013 I think the only \u2013 I was going to say the only major carrier \u2013 we\u2019re the only carrier that doesn\u2019t nickel and dime with bag fees, change fees, so we offer a tremendous value, and we have \u2013 we are meeting our financial goals with respect to our cash and our balance sheet and we are trying to serve all of our constituents, our people, our customers, our shareholders, so we are trying to take care of each one of those. Nobody a year ago saw a 50% decline in fuel prices looming. Nobody saw that, and so logic would tell you that as we sit here today it is going to be very difficult for any of us, you, me, Tammy, anybody, to predict what fuel prices will be a year from now. What I can tell you from experience is that it\u2019s very difficult to increase fares rapidly. Customers hate that and it tends to chase away demand very rapidly. Everyone of our legacy competitors that we compete against has been bankrupt over the past decade and bankrupted primarily because of surging fuel prices. So I think speaking for Southwest, I am very reluctant to take our customers through a rollercoaster ride fares and if we are all lucky, and energy prices remain low for an extended period of time, I can assure you that we will continue to offer low fares and continue to add flights and grow Southwest Airlines. So that\u2019s where the money is going. It\u2019s going back to invest in the infrastructure for Southwest, we\u2019re building new airports, we are building new technology for commercial purposes, for operational purposes and we are buying more airplanes. We are replacing our older airplanes and we are also adding growth so that we can expand in exciting places like we did last week by launching new international flights out of Houston. Michael Lindenberger : If I can just ask one quick follow up, you mentioned the legacy airlines, obviously you guys have sort of stayed out of the flight between them and the Gulf carriers but it does implicate this sort of \u2013 you\u2019re all in the same competitive mix, not obviously as much on the international carriers, but I am just wondering if you think there is any weakness in the legacy carriers position of arguing against the Gulf carriers, huge gains in the US market base in large part by lower fares and better service? Gary Kelly : Well, I would certainly acknowledge that we are all in the same industry but I would also be quick to add that we often take a differing view \u2013 with respect to the particular issue that you mentioned, it is not our priority, we haven\u2019t spent any time on it, and therefore we just have not taken a position. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andrea Ahles with the Star-Telegram. Andrea Ahles : Hi Gary, if you -- I heard you talk on the call about the Love Field case with Delta, in front of a federal judge. Delta was asked last week if they plan to appeal the ruling, if it goes against them and I wanted to ask you the same question, will you appeal \u2013 the Southwest appeal the judge\u2019s ruling if it goes against Southwest? Gary Kelly : Well, really I want to honor the judge\u2019s order here and comply first of all. We are looking forward to the decision and would expect that hopefully soon and I think we will respond accordingly at that time. Andrea Ahles : You are not willing to come out like Delta side and say that yes, we definitely plan to appeal this to the Circuit Court if it goes against that. Gary Kelly : I am not going to \u2013 not comply with the judge\u2019s order to not comment on this case. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Conny [ph] with The Associated Press. Unidentified Analyst : I\u2019ve got two questions, because I think the first one is probably a quick answer but can you say what your early load factors are on those international flights out of Houston and also on the cost side, that labor cost line really stands out, and even if that includes the pilots ratification bonus, even if it does, you are still up 14.4% and I am wondering if that is going to be a trend that your investors should expect to see going forward? Gary Kelly : David, on the latter, that\u2019s really profit sharing that\u2019s driving this. So I would welcome that kind of increase but yes, that\u2019s our variable pay component, when the company does well, our employees do even better. I\u2019ve talked more \u2013 I forgot your first easy question. Unidentified Analyst : Houston Hobby load factors, international \u2013 Gary Kelly : Well I can report this, we\u2019ve got by far the majority of our destinations or leisure destinations, those load factors are consistently very high. These are brand new markets. I am expecting us to have periods of time now when we have pretty light loads. The only markets that we\u2019ve typically seen softer loads than we would like would be the more business markets which is primarily Mexico City and some of the flight times there aren\u2019t optimal yet with the slot controls that they have in place. But I was there on Thursday and virtually all every flight going out there was full. So early returns are pretty much what we would have expected and I think we will do very well in that market, the fares have been very high, we\u2019re going to come in with famous low fares and would very much expect to have the Southwest effect to kick in. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : Has Southwest finished its response to the Justice Department, civil investigative demand and kind of give any other updates on where that process stands now? Gary Kelly : I think the only thing that I can appropriately comment on is that we are fully complying with the civil investigative demand. Certainly we\u2019ve worked hard and turned over a lot of information but as to exactly where that stands, I can\u2019t really comment any further.  End of Q& A Operator : And at this time I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you all very much. Of course, if there is any follow up questions, don\u2019t hesitate to call us or you can always reach out at swamedia.com and we will take care of you. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining.",

Joining me on the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO, Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please note today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company\u2019s current intent, expectations and projections. They are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning\u2019s press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. At this time, I\u2019d like to go ahead and turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Marcy and thanks everybody for joining us today for our year-end 2015 earnings call. This was another superb and critical year for Southwest, and I am very grateful to all of our people for their hard work. I want to especially thank them for these terrific results. Tammy is going to take us through the quarter, but I want to offer up, not a comprehensive overview, but at least a few highlights. Of course this was by far our best year of earnings in our entire history, and that includes a record return on invested capital of 32.7%. We no doubt benefited from 29% lower economic jet fuel prices. Obviously that was a major component of our earnings. But so were record load factors, and revenues were up also very solid 5.6%. It was a strategic year for us in that we had secular growth opportunities at Dallas arising from the refuel of Wright Amendment and of course that has been a phenomenal success. We\u2019ve also had secular growth opportunities out of Washington Reagan and LaGuardia that is arising from the acquisition of slots. It was also a year that follow at the end of 2014, the completion of the AirTran, our acquisition and integration. a lot of new markets resulted from that. And then of course it was also a year where we had a unique opportunity in which to build in international terminal and launch international flights out of Houston Hobby. That was for the first time since 1969 by the way. All of that added up to capacity growth of 7.2%, and then of course we were delighted that traffic was stronger than that. It grew 8.8%. And as a backdrop the economy for last year was solid travel demand was solid and of course energy prices moved even lower. So the convergence of all of these things made 2015 very successful year, but again one that was also very strategic for us. And we accomplished virtually everything that we set out to do, and in some cases where we didn\u2019t, we at least laid significant progress. I'm very happy about that, but certainly that includes generating record operating cash flow, strong free cash flow, and we also returned a record $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. So I want to make sure that I highlight two announcements from this morning's release. First of all, we announced that we will soon launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. I'm sure you all saw that. And then second we recently ordered 33 new 737-800s from Boeing, and that is spread out for delivery in '16, '17 and '18; and the sole purpose for that is to accelerate further the retirement of our Classic fleet. So mechanically we did that by exercising six options, and then on top of that we placed new orders for 27 more. So you get to 33 more new airplanes. And then in addition to that on our fleet chart, you'll also see that we have committed to two more used aircraft. But I just want to reiterate that our capacity plans for the next five years are essentially unchanged by this announcement. We're replacing the Classics with next generation airplanes. And then in particular our capacity plans for 2016 are unchanged and we still plan to grow this year between 5% and 6%. So the financial, operations and customer service effects of these fleet announcement are all very favorable and Tammy will take us through all that. Work continues along three basic themes this year, as far as investment goes for the future. One as we have significant airport renovation and infrastructure projects underway across the country, some we're managing, some we're not. But big project at LAX, Fort Lauderdale, Chicago Midway and New Orleans. In that Fort Lauderdale in particular will bring on new capacity for us in 2017. Number two, we've got significant commercial technology program underway, and the headline on that of course is the replacement of a reservation system that's also targeted for 2017. And then finally we have a major program underway with our operations technology, and the headline on that is the new 737 MAX, along with other very significant technology improvements that [Indiscernible] has planned, and that is also a 2017 deliverable, at least with respect to the MAX. So for this year, in addition to focus on these investment programs, we want to do a handful of things. We want to continue to manage our network growth and mature our developing markets. Number two we want to compete vigorously in an increasingly competitive environment. Number three, we want to continue to work on and improve our reliability of our operations. Next, we want to continue our focused on the hospitality of our customer service, and through all of this, we want to continue to grow our unit revenues, our margins and our earnings. So there is nothing really fancy about or 2016; pretty basic blocking and tackling things. But clearly 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for Southwest Airlines. I just want to highlight for our Southwest people finally that our profit sharing for 2015 will eclipse last year's record and increase by 74% to an all-time record of $620 million, and I am very pleased about that. I'm very proud of them and their hard work and I am very pleased that they're being justly rewarded with that. So Tammy, with that quick overview I'd love to turn it over to you and have you take us through the quarter. Tammy Romo : All right, thank you Gary and welcome everyone. We're very pleased to report a standard year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43 consecutive year of profit. Our annual earnings, excluding special items were a record $2.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted share, which was an increase of 75% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter performance was also record setting, and represented 11 consecutive quarter of profit. Fourth quarter net income excluding special items increased 46% year-over-year to $591 million or $0.90 per share, which was in line with consensus. Operating income excluding special items was a record $992 million, which produced a 5-point improvement in operating margin of 19.9%, which is the best fourth quarter margin we've seen since 1978, and it's also worth nothing like last quarter with and without the benefit substantially large rail prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. And the record that really stands out is free cash return on invested capital, excluding special items of 32.7%. I would like congratulate all of our outstanding employees on these fantastically built and like Gary thrilled we can reward our employees with a record breaking profit sharing $620 million for 2015. Our total operating revenues in the fourth quarter were a record $5 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year on a capacity increase of 8.4%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.6 billion. Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in more than 11% growth in traffic, and an all-time fourth quarter record high load factor. A softer yield environment resulted in a 7% decline in passenger revenue yields and an $8 decrease in our average fares. Our fourth quarter operating revenues included a $125 million net benefit from the amended Chase contract and the required accounting treatment, and this $125 million benefit was about 2 to 3-point improvement to RASM. For 2016, we expect to realize a year-over-year incremental benefit from the amended Chase agreement and accounting change, but once we reach third quarter, we will of course lapse the year-over-year benefit. For our first quarter 2016, our estimated incremental benefit is approximately $110 million and that is included in the RASM guidance that we provided. Our developmental markets continue to perform in line with our expectations, and Dallas continued to outperform the system on margins and return. International is also developing as planned, including our inaugural service from Houston, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter RASM declined 0.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Considering a point impact from development markets and roughly 2-point impact from increased [indiscernible] in space, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter record and likely industry leading revenue performance. Thus far in January, demand for our low fares remained strong, soft yet stable yields have continued thus far into first quarter and based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are estimating first quarter 2016 RASM will be flat year-over-year. In light of the current yield environment, we're very pleased with our first quarter revenue outlook at this juncture. Our freight and other revenue production was also favorable. In addition to the incremental benefit from the amended Chase card that I mentioned earlier, our ancillary revenue production was strong led by growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding revenues. And we currently expect first quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to be comparable with fourth quarter 2015. I'll turn to our cost performance now, and our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding special items decreased just under 7%, year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control, particularly our fleet modernization efforts. Our economic fuel cost decreased almost $200 million year-over-year and that was driven by a 23% decline in fuel prices. With the current state of the oil market and oversupply situation, we currently expect another year-over-year decline in first quarter and full year 2016 economic fuel cost. Based on our current hedge portfolio for this year, and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price to be approximately $1.70 per gallon, and I'll also provide you our estimates by quarter here. Second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.60 per gallon, and second half we expect that to be in the $1.80 to $1.95 per gallon range, again based on last Friday. And that brings us to a full year 2016 fuel price per gallon in the $1.70 to $1.75 range. So our market prices, we're still benefiting from lower fuel prices and currently estimate over $500 million in economic fuel savings this year. Our first quarter 2016 estimated fuel price per gallon is below last year's $2 per gallon and represents the lowest economic fuel price we've realized since third quarter of 2006. With respect to our hedge book, our strong profit margins today call for a more conservative approach to hedging in this low fuel environment. We will continue to manage our existing portfolio to minimize cost as we burn off our 2016 and 2017 position. Prospectively, we'll focus on catastrophic protection with no downside risk, particularly in this environment for 2018. As we reported or 35% hedged, and that\u2019s with all calls and call spread. So while our hedging philosophy has not changed, our tactics have in this environment. And we will manage through our portfolio and just fourth quarter of 2015, we participated in 85% of the market decline. So I\u2019ll take you through our non-fuel cost quickly. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were flat, including a 30% year-over-year increase in profit sharing that our employees earned for fourth quarter 2015. Our profit showing expense accrued in the fourth quarter was $136 million and that brings again the total for the year to understanding $620 million, which again was a 75% year-over-year. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs decrease 1.1% year-over-year, which was towards the more favorable end of our cost guidance, due primarily to a reduction in advertise and lower airport costs than we had expected. Our fleet modernization produced the expected $700 million an EBIT this year and that\u2019s even with the drop in fuel prices. Based on our current cost trends we expect first quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And keep in mind that roughly one point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation, which of course is a non-cash charge from our recent decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classic fleet that Gary took you through. For our full year 2016, we are currently estimating a 1% year-over-year increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel our special items and profit sharing. And again, this modest cost inflation is almost entirely driven by the accelerated depreciation. And as a quick reminder, as we noted in our press release this morning, this cost guidance only reflects our current labor contracts. Therefore, it does not include the impact from the tentative agreement currently out for vote with our ramp operations provisioning and cargo both. I\u2019ll move to our balance sheet and cash flows. And of course our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and that's as opposed to being $835 million in cash collateral to third-parties. We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2015 and incurred $2 billion in capital expenditures. For 2016, we continue to estimate CapEx of approximately $2 billion, and I\u2019ll cover our aircraft CapEx when I\u2019ll review our fleet plans so shortly. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2015, which exceeded our free cash flow of $1.1 billion. And we will have $200 million remaining on the $1.5 billion purchase program after we launch our 500 million accelerated share repurchase, which we will be doing soon. We repaid $213 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2015, and issued a $500 million senior unsecured note at an all-time low 2.65%. And this was in light of our debt maturities of approximately $600 million here in 2016. Our leverage including off balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low to mid 30% range, and of course we are very proud of our strong balance sheet, with an aggressive investment grade rating that was further strengthened during fourth quarter with an upgrade to BBB+ and that followed an upgrade in July by Moody\u2019s to BAA1. We\u2019re focused on preserving the strength in our balance sheet and cash flows, while continuing our long standing track record of returning significant value to our shareholders. I\u2019ll move now to our fleet and capacity plans. We ended 2015 with 704 aircraft, in our fleet as planned and outlined in this morning's release. Our press release also included our future delivery schedule that I pointed to, that we restructured at the end of December in conjunction with our decision to further accelerate the retirement of our Classic fleet. I\u2019ll quickly take you through the revisions that they included, the conversion of our remaining 25 NextGen-700 from orders to NextGen-800 from orders. And it included the addition as Gary mentioned of 33-800 firm deliveries and as he noted, some of those were options that we had exercised. And we had two additional -700s. We now intend to retire our Classic fleet no later than mid-2018, and that's compared to our previous plan that have retirement skewing into 2021. And we had a 129 Classic aircraft in our fleet at yearend. Roughly two thirds of our Classic aircraft were impacted by our decision to further accelerate the retirement; and the incremental in seakage [ph] aircraft in our restructured order book is intended to back flow these aircrafts while maintaining our current plans to keep our year-over-year fleet growth over the next three years to no more than 2% on average. The accelerated retirement plan is estimated to produce cumulative EBIT improvement of approximately $200 million over the acceleration period, and that's primarily through maintenance and fuel cost savings. And I'd also note that this incorporates the approximate $100 million in accelerated depreciation that I referred to earlier. And the overall customer experience will improve as well with a fully Wi-Fi equipped more modernized fleet. Our future from capital commitments increased approximately 400 million as a result of the order book revisions and our 2015 capital expenditures increased $200 million to $300 million and that was primarily related or that was related to restructuring of our order book.  Our aircraft CapEx for 2016 is still estimated to fall in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range, and our average aircraft CapEx for 2017 and 2018 combined is currently estimated to be in a similar range as 2016 which was very manageable. While the details of our Boeing agreement are confidential, the economics of our NZ order book are very supportive of our continued fleet modernization efforts. Overall the internal rate of return on accelerating retirement of our Classic fleet is estimated to exceed our -- the return of investment, and this is after tax, which we reported to you in 2015 of almost 21%. So it was a very easy decision for us. We are still optimizing our retirement schedule over the next few years, but we expect in 2016 with roughly 720 aircraft. With regards to capacity, we ended 2015 as planned and we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. And as we previously noted, the majority of 2016 capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of our 2015 expansion. So in conclusion, we ended an exceptionally strong 2015 with a record fourth quarter, and our outlook for first quarter calls for another quarter of strong operating margins approaching 20%. Despite a soft yield environment, demand held strong producing record revenues. We currently estimate our first quarter RASM will be flat year-over-year based on revenue and booking trends. That's for 2016, which suggest the continuation of the strong demand and a soft yield environment. Substantially lower fuel prices and other cost controls contributed to our favorable cost performance in 2015, and our outlook for 2016 calls for modest cost inflation excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And again, that was driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of our Classic fleet, which is expected to produce a significant cost savings, and an EBIT improvement and the $200 million range. We continue to benefit from lower fuel prices and currently estimate this year's fuel cost to be more than $500 million lower year-over-year, based on Friday's prices and including our current fuel hedge. Our balance sheet is industry leading and our cash flows remain strong, and as ever we are committed to creating value, and we are very pleased that we were able to restore over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015. And as we announced this morning, we will be launching our $500 million accelerated share repurchasing, which will leave $200 million remaining on our outstanding 1.5 billion buyback authorization. And again our pretax return on invested capital was an astounding 32.7%. I would like to close by thanking all of our employees for their outstanding contribution to these very strong results. So with that Tom, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And will now open our analyst portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for waiting. We'll begin our first question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : I'm hoping to ask 2.5 questions here. The half-question Tammy, you noted also as a TA -- two TAs out right now, they guided this morning and the impact assuming ratification. Are you willing do the same in terms of what that would mean for the XL [ph] cabin guide you just gave? Tammy Romo : No Jamie, just out of respect, the process of -- we'll update that as we progress here. Jamie Baker : Sure understood. So why don't we move on to Gary here, and another question on labor. Given your history of profitability, it's no surprise that your 737 wage rates came to represent the peak for U.S. Airlines easily over the last decade. But as the competitor wage bar begin to rise above yours currently, is it inevitable the Southwest pass to establish a peak with every successful contract; or put differently, is your business model predicated on maintaining above market pay scales, or was that just a byproduct of how poorly the competition was at one point? Gary Kelly : Well, I am going to try to give you -- I am going to try to answer your question and I want to try to be diplomatic and respectful of the negotiations process here. But I would just say our business model Jamie, is great service and low cost. And we -- every single employee at Southwest Airlines signs up for that, and of course we all need to continue to work hard every day to deliver on those two things. So that is our business model, not. There has never been a promise to be the highest paying airline in the industry. And so to the extent that we're able to do that because we produced great results, I think that is terrific. But all of that needs to obviously be negotiated with our labor groups and that's what happens, and that's the way that works. I think the overriding objective for us is to continue to have a healthy company meaning that we are safe and that we're financially strong. And in order to do that we've got continue to offer great service and our objective is to the low cost producer and live up to the low fare brand promise that we have. Jamie Baker : And as a follow up to that last point you've made and I guess this echoes the discussion that you and I had at the Wings Club. You've never faced a larger percentage of competitive capacity that have lower costs than your own than you currently do. In fact, last time you faced a formidable competitor with a superior cost structure, as near as I could tell, you brought them. So I'm wondering how growth at Spirit and Frontier, given their cost structures alters how you think about your own business going forward? Gary Kelly : Let me just affirm virtually everything you said. The only edit I would make is that actually when we acquired Air Tran, their costs were not lower than ours interestingly enough, at least by my analysis. Jamie Baker : Fair enough. Gary Kelly : But clearly there are carriers today whose costs are lower. On that point you and I certainly agree. And first of all, I think that is inventible that overtime that an industry will get more competitive, especially when there is a disrupter as there has been with Southwest Airlines. So it is not shocking at all that we have more intense competition today than in any time in our history. And it is a challenge for our Company and something that I'm very confident that our people will rise up to that challenge. But indeed, it will put an obligation on us to continue to innovate and work very, very hard so that we don\u2019t lose our low fare leadership position in the country. So absolutely, it is different and I think we recognize that the industry is more competitive today than it has been ever. I would quickly add by the way that Southwest has never been stronger. We've never had the route network. We've never had the depth and the breadth of the service that we offer. And we've never had a balance sheet this strong, we've never had earnings this strong. So it's really up to us to continue to make sure that we compete and be the best at service and price. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : So the hedge liabilities you called out for '16 and '17, appreciate that detail. I'm just wondering, can that change or is it fully locked in at this point? In other words, if fuel goes higher, does it shrink? Tammy Romo : It is if fuel goes higher, it certainly shrinks. I'll start there. And no, it is not entirely locked in. But I think the main takeaway there is that we -- as prices go down, so does our fuel bill as well. So yes, I gave you a pretty good amount of detail there on our hedge as I walk through our -- my comments there. So I think we're positioned very well. We know what we have to manage and I think we're positioned well, if fuel prices go up or if they go down from here. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then as we think about the capacity that you had in development last year and specifically the Redmond markets, can you help us quantify the benefit you expect, having less of that capacity in development? And if you can help us with sort of the full pie, maybe you could just talk about the markets that you launched in late 2014 that you should've had basically a year of experience with by the fourth quarter, if you saw sort of significant RASM improvement there. And thanks for taking the questions? Gary Kelly : Duane, you were fading in and out, but I think we got the gist of your question. Yes, we have -- we can quantify at least from an internal perspective what we think the opportunity is there. I would just start out by acknowledging that that assumes all else as equal and \u2013 but, I'm sure that you and everyone else understand that. Tammy Romo : Yes, just a couple of comments there to maybe help you out, Duane. We had, again like you said a high number -- high percentage of our markets were under development. You know what those markets are and I'll remind you that the high percentages did include the market that we were converting from AirTran over to Southwest. So the point I'm making there is not all of the markets are created equal. Obviously we reported a lot on Dallas, Love Field and are very pleased with how those markets are progressing. But we wouldn\u2019t expect our international markets as an example to mature at the rate we would say Dallas or even the AirTran markets. So they're all a little bit different, but I can at least help quantify the impact we're expecting here in the first quarter. And if you -- it's probably in terms of -- it's probably at 1 point, I call it -- maybe not even a 1-point impact from development markets. So as we move in to 2016, at least my expectation would be that we'll get some tailwinds from our development markets as those continue to mature. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Just two for you guys. The first, I guess with oil coming down so much, and obviously you're going to see that benefit from the fuel numbers you provided. How does that impact how you're thinking about the business either from a revenue or a capacity standpoint, if at all? And then second question was just, you announced the aircraft order today and the acceleration. What drove down -- what changed over the last couple of months. It seems like the opportunity has been out there for some time? Gary Kelly : Tammy, I'll take a shot, and if you want to chime in, please do on both of those. I would admit to you all that it is -- the year is off to a very concerning start, when it comes to headlines around the world. It's almost as if we're living in a different dimension here at Southwest, and from what I've heard from some of our competitor reports too. So our business continues to be strong, but I will quickly admit that there are concerning headlines around the world. So then you translate this to oil prices and living in Texas my entire life, this is an oil and gas state, and yes, it is concerning, the impact it will have on companies and debt payments and jobs and so on. There's no question that the United States has benefited from the oil and gas boom that was occurring over the last X number of years since the -- really since the recession. So yes, that's all a concern that no doubt you have. We share that. But at least in terms of seeing any manifestation of that in our business, we just \u2013 we don\u2019t see it. Even our oil and gas markets, if you want to call them that, produced very strong results in the fourth quarter. Several of our markets have year-over-year -- our yield pressure if you will. So that's not unique to those markets, but they still produce very, very handsome returns. But yes, it's just something we're going to have to keep our eye on. And I offer that background, just as an acknowledgment that we're just living in a world where we need to continue to be alert and be cautious. I will then follow-on and say that we feel like our plan for 2015 was sound and it turned out to be so. We think that the follow-on plan for 2016 is also sound. It is more conservative then what we had committed ourselves for last year. And as Tammy and I have both reiterated, we\u2019ve not made any change with our capacity outlook. And especially for 2016, we\u2019re still right in the 5% to 6% range, and I think all of us would be prepared that if for whatever reason travel demand weakens, then we would want to address that, and then at least discuss what kind of options we have to react on the down side. But in terms of taking advantage, further advantage of low energy prices and boosting our capacity, we don\u2019t have any plans to do that. Tammy, before we go into the second question, anything you would like to add? Tammy Romo : No, I think that was perfect. And in terms of your question on why did we decide to accelerate the Classics. I guess, I just point that to our fleet modernization efforts that when we set our plan, I guess, I just have to say, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the benefits from our fleet modernizations so far, and as we've continued to evaluate, just the operating cost of operating Classic as it dwindles in size. We just really took out our pencils, evaluated it and we were able to come up with a plan that actually is going to enable us to improve our EBIT at very modest capital levels. So I think you know our Southwest well. We prefer a simplified fleet, and even though the Classic fleet is 737, we'd much prefer to operate 700s and 800s. It certainly simplifies a lot of the operations, and also just improves the reliability in terms of just less downtime from a maintenance perspective. So I think we\u2019ll get also get a boost from the productivity of our fleet, which certainly was part of the EBIT contribution that we\u2019re expecting. So all-in-all when we set down and evaluated it, it became pretty compelling to go ahead and accelerate the Classics. So hopefully that helps provide a little color as to what went into the decision making tranches. Gary, did you have anything? Gary Kelly : Tammy, only thing I would say about -- it\u2019s always a fair question; why now? Why not earlier? Why not later? And I think it's back to that convergence or confluence of things. First of all, we\u2019re at a fleet number that is manageable to think about accelerating retirement in that way. We have more out of service time with those airplanes for maintenance reasons than we do the rest of our fleet. And Tammy made that point. I just want to reiterate. You'll get a lot more productivity out of a new airplane than what we are currently getting out of these Classics, which means you don\u2019t necessarily even have to have a tail-by-tail replacement, although that is our plan. But they'll be more efficient. The other thing is that Boeing was available to us. Boeing had delivery positions and we were able to strike a deal with them, and in a way that worked for them and was win for them. It was win for us. So that was key. With respect to our people, think about the people who have to touch the airplane, the pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, specially. It\u2019s just far easier for our people to operate the NextGen than it is the Classic. That's just a fact. So this will simplify a lot of things for all three of those work groups and in particular, our pilots. So it\u2019s a good deal. If it works out, it will be better for our customers and all the way around we're just delighted that we have this alternative available and we\u2019re able pull all together to end of the year. But it was an idea and a decision that was aggressively pursued in 2015, in fact in the later part of 2015 and fortunately it all team together. Tammy Romo : And just again on the cost obviously. As always, it's just part of our DNA at Southwest. We're very focused on costs and being the low costs producer, and this is just yet another way to help us as we\u2019re managing our cost here over the next several years. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : You guys didn\u2019t buy back stock in the quarter for first time in almost five years it looks like. You'd still put money off in the repo and I understand you did the $500 million ARS. But I would have thought you guys would come in and thoughts on after cutting the revenue guide. Did that have anything to do -- not buying the stock have anything to do with posting 800 [ph] million dollars in hedge collateral, or can you give us any kind of colors, the thinking behind sort of putting it on hold for the quarter? Tammy Romo : No. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with the fuel hedge collateral, and honestly wouldn't read anything into that at all. We are more focused. As we said this morning we are launching a 500 million accelerated share repurchase and we'll get that launched soon, and then after that we will have 200 remaining on our 1.5, which was approved at our shareholder meeting last night. So we've gone through that authorization pretty darn quick, returning more than a 100% of our free cash flow in 2014 to our shareholders. So I'm very proud of what we did there in 2014 with respect to the share repurchases. So again, actually that included our dividends. So we are -- I don\u2019t think there is anything more to it than that. Gary Kelly : That's true. That was already a record amount, and as we've allowed here, we were also beginning to have serious thoughts and conversations with the Boeing company and what -- how that cash flow might flow from that deal. So I think what's material is that we have announced the $500 million today. Hunter Keay : Yes. Okay that's just fair. Thank you. And looks like -- when I look at schedule data, I think you guys are trimming over the capacity at Love Field markets into LaGuardia and Regan and moving some of that out west little bit. Does that have anything to do with the operational challenges that you might be encountering at Love Field because of the ongoing legal dispute and obviously the [indiscernible] or feel it but does that have anything to do with that, or is that unrelated and there are other factors, maybe just sort of like market demand based decisions. Any color around what's flowing into that -- if the [indiscernible] is correct. Gary Kelly : Yes. You bet, yes sir you bet. No. There is no -- I think our operations folks have done a marvelous job. They are doing what is for us ten turns a day on a gate with well -- in less than full utilization of 18 gates. So the operation actually is doing fine, which simply means that we have --- when we finally get access to all the gates, we will be able to put more flights in there. But you'll note Hunter, that we make changes all over the country, and we don\u2019t make dramatic changes in Dallas, but you've got markets like Seattle that come into mind and Fort Myers, Florida where we make very significant seasonal adjustments. The other things that I mentioned to the media on this very same question this morning is that you know that we have a lot of new flying that's transpired since October 2014. And I went through all that stuff and so has Tammy. So with all of those new way routes, I think we would readily admit to you that in some cases we may have too many flights in some places, we may not have enough flights in places, and so there is always some tuning that continues, and that is all that's going on here at Love Field. So my recollection -- we'll still at a 180 daily departures, which probably cut through everything, and answers your questions best that way. But yes we've got some pluses and minuses in routes, and there's nothing unusual about that. Operator : And will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Just on the unit cost growth, I was just kind of curious, with the higher capacity growth in the first half, I would have thought maybe -- a little surprised by the 2% [indiscernible] growth, and then just wondering -- I know the one-point from the [indiscernible] depreciation. Just wondering the timing -- the timing issues or what was leading to that very high increase in 1Q? Tammy Romo : Yes. You are exactly right, Savi. The guidance for the full year is more 1%. So you are exactly right. It's just the timing of when our expenses are falling. Savi Syth : Got it. And then just on the USCC question, they came up before; just wondering Gary, if you have any thoughts here. It seems like the industry was going through a bit of the segmentation. And I know Southwest wants to be kind of the leading low cost, low fare airline. But there is a product differential, and then your kind of performance or be at the product or the service, and merely the things that I was just kind of curious as to what your thought process is? Do you need to be the lowest fare recognizing, that there is a difference in product, and then maybe your thoughts on kind of the customer segmentation, if there is a customer segmentation or if this is truly like a commodity business and you just have to be -- have the lowest fares? Gary Kelly : Well. I love your question. Well, everybody's question, but that -- I think that's one that's an interesting one to share. And I'm happy to have an opportunity to address it. We want to be the best service at the lowest price. Period. And describing price, I would agree that we are going to have to do some comparisons between unbundled pricing versus our more bundled approach. All-in, I want Southwest Airlines to be the lowest price. We'll win if we have the best service at the lowest price. And that's been our tradition, that's been our history, that\u2019s what the whole Company is based upon, and that's what our growth plans are fundamentally based upon. I think it is a slippery slope to accept that our costs and our fares can be higher based on service, because as you well know, there is a long list of failures in the airline industry who pursue that exact strategic plan. And it's really a compound. It really not facing up to the challenges of finding more and better ways to compete on cost and on price. So thing I love about Southwest is it's been a Company who has been able to do both. And the other thing that you find I think, which is a slippery slope is companies can change. And while service may not be a great attribute for some of our competitors today, who will go on unnamed, who is to say as they can change that in the future. And so we need to continue to strive to be the best at both, and we need -- while we may not have all the answers at any given point in time, I think that that needs to continue to be our guiding line. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Two quick ones here. When we started the quarter, the guide was for RASM to be up about 1%, and as we moved through much of the quarter, that number was out there. And then, about a month back you took guidance down. And when I think about across the industry, we did see some, some of the carriers come in with weaker than expected at revenues. Some of it was fuel surcharges, some of it was FX, some of it was the Paris attacks. Those are to take some things that I didn\u2019t think impacted you on one hand. Then on the other, we did hear that some airlines just ran a better operation because the winter weather wasn't that bad. So I am curious with your exposure on the energy patch, was that some of it, that you saw some demand weakness in your core energy markets, or is it just a better run operation? What drove that down so much? Gary Kelly : Mike, I don't think Tammy would either. I wouldn't blame our energy markets at all, although as I mentioned earlier, I think it is true that the energy markets are seeing some softness in RASM year-over-year, but they're still really healthy. I think the thing that\u2019s -- and Tammy will better insights no doubt, but the thing that stands out to me was Thanksgiving. And we were pretty much tracking along with our forecast for the quarter until then. And if you'll recall our discussion with our November traffic, the pricing environment was not -- I used a word and it was quoted at the time, it was unusual. So the Christmas holiday period was more normal. But regardless, you kind of fast-forward now and Tammy, maybe it might be more helpful to talk about current trends as opposed to what changed, but Mike, that was the main thing that I recall in the fourth quarter, was the yields over the week of thanksgiving holiday travel based on unusual discounting in the industry were lower than what we would have predicted. Anything you want to add there, Tammy? Tammy Romo : Yes, Gary I agree. That really was what -- that was primarily what was different from what our forecast was going into the quarter. And by the end of year with the holiday performance in the December, that was actually within our expectations. So as we're just trying to sort through all of that I would just -- our expectation going into the first quarter based on what we've seen so far, and in January is demand seems strong. We're continuing to see strong load factors, but again we're also continuing to see those come in at weaker yields. So at least I guess the way I would characterize at least from what we're seeing so far and our bookings is stabilized. Gary Kelly : Mike, the only other thing I would just point out is we had the same question here after -- so Thanksgiving occurred the Paris attacks. And whether there was an effect on bookings with us, with our competitor, I don't know. That's hard to tease out all of that. But the other thing that's going here is if you looking the border GDP results for the fourth quarter, and they weren\u2019t very good. So it's possible that the industry was seeing some softening in demand that led to more aggressive discounting. And it's coupled with the industry also growing faster than GDP. So it wouldn\u2019t be shocking to find that there was a little bit of a rough patch there and just trying to get supply and demand cleared at the right price. So -- but any of that -- beyond that, we're continuing to manage our developing markets. We're continuing to manage our markets in which there are competitive changes in terms of pluses and minuses in activity and overall the demand -- that all -- as we said -- demand, it all adds up to I think a very solid outlook. And I'll just reiterate one more time, that our results are not adjusted for the difference in stage, length and gauge. If you do that, we're turning in positive unit revenue performances in the fourth quarter for the full year 2015, and that would also continue to be our outlook in the first quarter. Michael Linenberg : It's a good point. And then just on the capacity, I apologize if you threw this out there, Tammy, but I think you gave the full year number five to six, which is obviously unchanged, but normally around this time of the year, you'd get it to us by quarter end. The way it seems, it seems like it would be front end loaded, obviously impacted by the leap day. Do you have kind of rough -- what those rates are by quarter, how we should model it for the year? Gary Kelly : Well, she did say 8 to 9 for the first quarter. Tammy Romo : Yeah, 8. Michael Linenberg : It's 8. Tammy Romo : 9 for the\u2026 Gary Kelly : It is \u2013 I think it was 8.3 in the fourth quarter or so. The high watermark is going to be this quarter and then it will start trending down from there, but I will defer to you on the rest of the quarters, Ms. Romo. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Mr. Kelly. Yes, so after this quarter, second quarter is in the 4% to 5% range, yes. Operator : And that concludes the Analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion. At this time, I'd like to introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Outreach. Linda Rutherford : Thank you and good afternoon. If you go ahead and queue up, Tom you can give them instructions and we'll get started up on the media Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you for standing by. We'll take our first question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : Has Southwest recently exited any pure hedge contracts early for further participation in the fuel price decline? And if so, at what cost? Tammy Romo : Yes, I'll be happy to take that. We have reduced our hedges here in 2016. So the answer to that question would be yes. We -- we're just looking at what we had last reported to you in terms of our hedge percentages against the main difference would be in the second half of 2016. so we did reduce our hedges there substantially in light of the declining fuel market. So we went from call it 60% to 70% in the second half of 2016 to probably closer to 30% to 35%. Jeffrey Dastin : And a brief follow up to make sure I understood your earlier comments correctly. Is Southwest relying more heavily on call options this year than last? Tammy Romo : That would be going forward, and that's correct. And in fact our 2018 position only represents call options. That's exactly right. Gary Kelly : So in other words we were already long with a position for '16 and '17 as 2015 unfolded. So Tammy and her team are continuing to work those positions off as best they can, but then any additional hedges that they're doing, they're doing with the call options to answer your question there. Jeffrey Dastin : So, the call options are also for 2016 and 2017 in addition to 2018. Tammy Romo : Actually anything that we've added, just to be fair to your question, well\u2026 Gary Kelly : Yes. Tammy Romo : The majority of what we've added in 2015 has been call, because all we have is 2018. But yes, I think that would be fair. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And Ms. Rutherford, there appears to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you so much Tom. If anyone in our media community has any follow-up questions, please reach out to us 214-792-4847 or shoot us a question over to www.swamedia.com. Thanks, and have a great afternoon. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining.",

My name is Tom and I'll be moderating today's call. Today's conference is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand - Managing Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our first quarter 2016 results. Joining the call today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations, and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information, regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. At this time, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marcy, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We are absolutely delighted with these results and considering the quality of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service and these strong profits, it is absolutely the best start we've had to a year in over two decade. So, I'm very, very pleased. Of course, a big driver in our 33% earnings per share growth is a lower jet fuel price, but the revenue performance was also superb. This year is essentially the follow-through to a healthy expansion that began back in 2014, with the repeal of the Wright Amendment and then the aggressive expansion out of Dallas Love Field and that was followed by the integration and conversion of AirTran at yearend 2014. And that generated a lot of new flights in Southwest as well. Following the AirTran conversion, we launched four new international cities in 2015, as well as a new terminal and domestic gateway at Houston Hobby. So, you add all that up and it's a 9.2% capacity growth here in the first quarter. I would certainly admit that that is a lot, and what is impressive is that our revenue growth kept pace. So, we continue to experience outstanding performance out of Dallas Love Field. The rest of our developing markets are providing a very nice tailwind as well, as they continue along an expected maturity path. Last year at this time, we had about 20% of our system in development, and this year because we have intentionally slowed the additions of new markets, we have only about 5% in development. And of course, as a backdrop, the industry is adding seats aggressively. It's a very competitive environment. Of course, that's all fine with us, we have low cost and we have a great low fare brand, but we've been very pleased with the consistent strong demand for the Southwest product, resulting in yet another record load factor in the first quarter, and numerous other records for that matter. But the point is even in the face of our growth and the intensely-competitive environment, we're doing really, really well. And I would attribute that to a couple of things. First and foremost to our people, and the terrific service that they offer our customers every single day, I'm very proud of them. And of course, I congratulate them on these great results and the record profit sharing that they have earned. I also attribute our results to our strong domestic network, where we offer more seats and board more customers than any other airline. Our marketing department in particular has done a terrific job of distilling our message with our advertising campaign on Transfarency. The customer awareness of the low fare value that you get with Southwest is very high. And that timing of that campaign matches perfectly with the incredible momentum that we have had with our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. So, we have a strong profitable network, we have great service, low fares with nothing to hide. We have an award-winning loyalty program and all of that served up by outstanding employees. So, we are exceptionally well positioned to compete and grow and we intend to keep it just that way. Before I turn it over to Tammy, I have noticed in some of the reports this morning, a little bit of confusion. So, I did want to make an opening clarifying point, which is \u2013 with the now earlier retirement of our Classic fleet, I just want to be sure that everyone understands that what we said in our press release is that means that the growth rate will be less, not that our capacity will be less. So, we will still grow available seat miles under any scenario that we've contemplated in 2017 compared to 2016, and then the same would be true also for 2018 as compared to 2017. The point is, is that the growth rate in 2017 will no doubt be less than it could have been. So, Tammy with those opening remarks, let me just turn it over to you to take us through the quarter, please ma'am? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Gary, and welcome everyone. We're thrilled to report on our exceptionally strong first quarter results. Net income, excluding special items, increased almost 26% year-over-year to a record $567 million and earnings per share grew 33%. This represented our 12th consecutive quarter of record profits. Our revenue results remained at record levels, and we continued to benefit from low fuel prices and our ongoing fleet modernization efforts. We expanded our operating margins, excluding special items to 19.7%, which is the highest it's been in more than 35 years. And our pre-tax return on invested capital excluding special items for the 12 months ended March 2016 was 33.4%, which well exceeded our cost to capital on after-tax basis. Just a fantastic start to the year, and I'd also like to congratulate our wonderful employees on these outstanding results and the record first quarter profit sharing of $155 million. Our strong revenue performance in first quarter was a significant driver of our record first quarter earnings. Operating revenues grew to a record $4.8 billion, and our passenger revenues also grew to record levels. Strong demand for our low, friendly fares and the overall strength of our network were contributing factors to our 9.3% increase in revenues. We're pleased with the performance of our development markets that resulted in about a point in that tailwind to RASM in first quarter. International markets also performed in line with our expectations, including our new Houston market and Dallas continues to produce solid results with load factor expansion and strong margins in first quarter. Our Rapid Rewards revenue production was very strong in the quarter, including approximately $125 million year-over-year incremental revenues from our amended co-brand agreement with Chase last July. And our ancillary revenues continue to perform very well. Our revenue growth was in line with our capacity, resulting in flat RASM, which was industry-leading and notable considering the one-point to two-point impact from our stage and gauge increase in first quarter. All around, very pleased with the first quarter revenue performance. While the weak yield environment has continued into second quarter, demand so far has remained solid. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are expecting a modest growth in second quarter 2016 RASM performance year-over-year. And just as a reminder again, this outlook includes roughly a $125 million from the Chase agreement and accounting change. But just as a reminder, that we will lapse that year-over-year benefit in the third quarter. Our freight revenue was down slightly year-over-year and other revenue production was boosted by the Chase agreement, but also by a 12% increase in ancillary revenues mostly from growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding product. We currently expect second quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from second quarter last year. Turning to our costs, we are very pleased with our first quarter cost performance. Our operating unit costs excluding special items decreased 2.6% year-over-year from ongoing fleet modernization benefits, milder weather and lower jet fuel prices. Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 11% year-over-year to $1.78. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower crude and heating oil prices, offset by higher hedging settlements year-over-year. We ended up a little higher than our previous guide at the beginning of March, simply due to the increase in the crude and heating oil since that time. And based on market prices as of Monday and our second quarter hedge that remains unchanged, we currently expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.75 to $1.80 range. And for full year 2016, we currently expect to fall in the $1.85 to $1.90 range based on current market prices. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were comparable to first quarter last year and down slightly when you also include \u2013 excuse me, exclude profit sharing. This was better than our previous guidance due to milder weather and the associated cost avoidance as well as shift in project spend to later this year. Based on our current cost trends, we expect second quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, to increase approximately 2% year-over-year, and roughly one point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirements. And the remainder of the cost inflation is largely the result of timing of advertising and technology investments. For the full-year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong. And our cash and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We allowed our cash to build a bit as we plan to fund our 2015 profit sharing accrual later this month. And we also intend to launch a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, which will be completed next month. Our record free cash flow was $1.2 billion as a result of strong operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and $438 million of capital spend. For our full-year 2016, we continue to estimate manageable CapEx of approximately $2 billion. We returned $596 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter. And as I previously mentioned, we will be launching a $200 million accelerated share repurchase this month to complete our current $1.5 billion repurchase authorization. And this was on the heels of returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015. Returning significant value to our shareholders remains a priority, along with preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows. Our leverage including balance sheet (sic) [including off balance sheet] aircraft leases remains in the low-to-mid 30% range, and we are very proud of our strong balance sheet, and we remain the only domestic airline with an investment grade rating from all three rating agencies. Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend just a little bit of time going over our announcement this morning regarding our Classic retirement fleet plans. So as you will recall in January, we announced our intent to retire our Classic fleet no later than mid-2018. Earlier this month, we made the decision to refine the acceleration date to no later than third quarter 2017 to allow for our Classic fleet to be retired ahead of our planned operating date of the Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft. By doing so, we'll alleviate the potential training complexities related to operating both the Classic and MAX aircraft. Boeing and the FAA aren't expected to determine their training requirements of operating the Classic, MAX pair until May of 2017 at the earliest, which doesn't allow adequate time to be trained and operationally ready for a 2017 MAX launch. So our preference to address the undefined FAA requirement was to segment Classic and MAX flying. We've been working with the SWAPA negotiating team to come up with a mutually beneficial solution to address the segmentation, but unfortunately, we've been unable to come to an agreement. So in order to move forward with our plan to launch the MAX, we must proceed with a solution, which retiring our Classic fleet no later than third quarter 2017 provides. So as a result of this decision, we'll have about 50 fewer aircraft than previously planned in fourth quarter 2017, which obviously also creates less capacity. And again, as Gary mentioned, we intend to have capacity growth but just this decision alone creates less capacity than what we had previously planned. That said, we're evaluating our options given these circumstances and believe we have a lot of flexibility to manage through the temporary dip in our fleet as we did with the 717s including utilization of our fleet. So with that in mind, we continue to expect our year-over-year fleet growth for the three years ended 2018 to average no more than 2%, and again our annual year-over-year capacity over that period is still expected to peak this year at 5% to 6%. So while we continue to evaluate our fleet plans based on where we are today, our aircraft CapEx forecast remains in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for this year. And while I mentioned before our preference for a number of reasons would have been to segment our fleet, however we still estimate EBIT improvement of at least $200 million from accelerating the Classics from the 2021 timeframe to 2017, again largely driven by maintenance and fuel savings. This is net of the impact of the estimated accelerated depreciation of approximately $130 million that will largely be expensed during 2016. And of course, accelerating our Classic retirements results in an improved customer service even faster with a fully equipped Wi-Fi fleet by the end of third quarter of next year. So, with regards to capacity, just again to be clear, we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. Our second quarter and third quarter ASMs will increase in the 4% to 5% range, and we will be publishing our fourth quarter schedule in May, which will go through January 4 of next year. And as we've noted previously, the majority of 2016's capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of 2015's unique expansion opportunity. So while our capacity plans beyond 2016 are yet to be determined, we do expect 2017 and 2018 year-over-year ASM growth to bend down from 2016's level. We will remain disciplined in our approach to growth with a focus of flexibility to adjust if needed and with a goal to preserve strong returns and margins. So, in conclusion, we had another record quarter with or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices. Our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. Demand remained strong, producing record revenues and our outlook for second quarter suggest positive operating unit revenue growth. Our cost outlook for the year is for modest inflation driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classic fleet even faster than we had previously announced, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Fuel prices remain lower year-over-year, and we have had very strong free cash flow this year, and our balance sheet is strong as ever. We've continued our commitment to return value to shareholders, and intend to complete our current authorization with the launch of a $200 million ASR by the end of this month, and we will continue to prudently manage our capital spend, and we'll remain disciplined in our valuation of future growth opportunities. Again, our pre-tax return on invested capital was an exceptional 33.4%. Our outlook for second quarter supports another quarter of strong margins, likely in excess of first quarter's 19.7%. And with that, I'd like to close by thanking our employees again for another fantastic quarter. So, Tom, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin with our first question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Can you just talk about the RASM trend from here, obviously you've got a nice increase going into the second quarter. But as we think about just the rest of the year, and well I think the credit card deal, is it going to be hard for you to stay in that positive territory, that's the first question. And then the second is, you talked about kind of evaluating or looking at a range of options to address some of the Classic flying, can you just talk about what those range of options are? Is there the potential for more CapEx or more orders or anything like that? Thank you. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Rajeev. I'd be happy to start with your question regarding RASM trends. So, I'll just walk you through the quarter a bit. So, just at the highest level, January and February RASM were slightly down and then March was slightly up, which got us to the roughly flat unit revenue comparison with about $15 million of benefit from Easter in March. So, April RASM adjusted for Easter is currently running in line with March, and as you think about the comparisons as we move forward in the quarter, we expect those to improve as a result of the increased competitive environment that we began experiencing in May and June of last year. And then of course as a reminder again, we'll continue to have the year-over-year benefit from the Chase agreement \u2013 at least through the second quarter here. So, again I think we're positioned very well here as we start second quarter, and I would just characterize the demand environment as solid. And so at this point just we're continuing to see the same sort of trends that we saw in the first quarter. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm sorry. What about just the rest of the year and keeping that trend going, especially with the Chase agreement lapsing? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's the one. Yeah, so it's always hard to predict further out in the year. Certainly, we're off to a good start here in the second quarter. And as you pointed out, the comparisons do become more difficult in the second half, because we lapsed the benefit of the Chase agreement. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I might take up the \u2013 unless you have any more questions on that Rajeev, I might take up the fleet question for a second. I think it is the usual suspects, they're available to us. We can tweak the utilization of the aircraft, which translates to a longer duty day of the airplane, I'm not sure that that's what we want to do, but that is an option. In other words, just flying later earlier and later in the day. We can search the used market for more 700s and we can \u2013 we'll have some options as you know by our fleet chart, we have options that can be exercised as well, which would translate to more \u2013 to be clear that would be more capital spending, that's not in Tammy's capital spending guidance that in other words, the capital spending guidance does not assume the exercise of any options to be clear. In no scenario that we've talked about would we bring in 50 more airplanes, and Mike (25:13), I don't recall exactly how many aircraft would be ultimately retired under the previous scenario, but I'm going to guess, it was around 30 that would've been retired in one step a 30-ish. So, the 50 is not quite as large as it might sound, although again that's a real number, but we were already going to retire a fair number of aircraft in 2018. So, as I said in the press release, this is all manageable, it's not preferable, but it's all manageable. And we're just not \u2013 the first thing that we wanted to share with all of our team and of course you all as well is that, that is going to happen that being the Classic retirement acceleration. Now, the company can go to work on translating that into maintenance programs for that fleet to now retire earlier, that will avoid some maintenance spending, as Tammy's already made clear. And then, we can explore other options as far as bringing either leased equipment in or exercising some options and spending a little bit more capital. But I think the other thing just to make sure that everybody is clear in their head on is that, our projected fleet at the end of 2018 is unaffected by any of this. So, you're simply talking about accelerating retirements from 2018 into 2017. And that makes this all for us a little bit easier and another reason, why we'll want to be thoughtful about bringing on more airplanes to replace that. So all of that is still an open question and as soon as we make some choices there, I am sure we'll be sharing those. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Tammy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Gary, on the topic of the Classics, is the decision potentially reversible, and how much lead time would you need if you did negotiate a solution to keep these airplanes in the fourth quarter of 2017? I'm trying to assess at lower capacity is it done deal here or if this is merely a shot across SWAPA's bough that could be revisited at the negotiating table? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I read your note earlier, so I'm glad you asked me the question because one thing I wanted to clarify is this is not a shot, contrary to the way our industry has worked with employees in the past, that's not the way we do business here at Southwest, so. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, duly noted. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you know that, I just wanted to be sure that all of our listeners know that, but that's not what this is about. We're here to take care of our people and clearly accelerating this retirement is not going to be a good thing for our employees, this is not a bad thing, but we are not at war with our people, we're at war with our competitors, number one. With respect to whether it is negotiable, well, in that spirit, of course, we want to continue to work with the pilot union in particular to do what we can to keep our cost competitive and grow this airline, so that we can be as competitive as possible. I don't realistically see a scenario, Mike (28:57), where we can \u2013 I mean that's why we're sharing this today, it's not so much that it is a decision, I don't see that we have any choice because we have to begin to put plans into effect for training, maintenance and then if we are going to go out and try to mitigate the earlier retirement, we've got to get working on that and I'm sure that sooner than later, we want to make commitments there. So, as a practical matter, I think that's a done deal. And to be blunt, I just don't see SWAPA moving on their position regarding segmentation. So, as a practical matter, I think it's a done deal. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate the color. On the topic of SWAPA and the pilot offer from last month, it did look pretty rich to us and represented over two points of CASM by our analysis and again that's just the pilots, all in it's getting hard to imagine how the entirety of your new contracts won't increase ex-fuel CASM by four points, possibly more if it was rolled up into a single year. What assurances, Gary, can you give us that you possess sufficient revenue initiatives that can offset this cost pressure or do we just have to assume that post-labor, Southwest will have lower, still very good, but lower margins than today on a fuel neutral basis? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, great questions. Obviously, it is very important for us to maintain our low fare brand and our low fare brand is not negotiable. In order to have a business in a low fare brand, we have to have that supported by low cost. So, that's what the company was founded on 45 years ago and we're certainly not going to re-trade that. All these negotiations, they are complex, they take a long time and especially in light of the fact that we are in mediation where the mediator has asked us to maintain confidentiality about what is discussed, I know you don't expect me to go into any detail, but I certainly want to honor that request for confidentiality. But all of this just has to be addressed at the negotiating table, and with an eye towards rewarding our people, and compensating them handsomely, but doing that in a way where we maintain industry leading productivity and efficiency so that we sustain our low cost structure. So, what I can give you assurance on is that we have not wavered on our desire to achieve that goal, and we'll have to continue to work together with our union leadership to be able to live up to that. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Gary, I appreciate the color, and thanks for even finding the time to read our short blurb this morning. I'm flattered. So thanks again. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jamie, we're fascinated by it. So, I would never miss it. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Take care everybody. Operator : And we'll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. So, Gary or maybe Bob if he's there too, when you think about the heavy mix of connecting traffic at Love Field, even more specifically on the Wright Amendment routes being so high like well above 40% I think, it looks like you may have sort of inadvertently created a bit of a rolling hub there. So, thinking about that in the context of the new market development, how satisfied are you right now with your ability to manage yields in Dallas on an O&D basis given all those connections, and is that an opportunity that is sort of a new for you guys that maybe has a little bit of underappreciated upside that even you yourselves are unable to quantify right now? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm going to let Bob speak to that as well, and he is here, he's sitting right by me. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No actually I feel like the Dallas Love Field operation is pretty much in line with what I would have expected except as I admitted to you all before, the rapid development of those markets and the full flights actually took me a little bit by surprise. I thought it would take us a while longer to produce the kind of results we have there. Tammy, I did glance this morning earlier, the returns out of Dallas are still right at system average, maybe just a hair below for the first quarter. So, simply meaning Hunter that it is, I would not call Dallas in development, clearly Bob is going to disagree and say there's certain markets that he wants to see better performance but overall as an entity, it looks really good. I've never noticed any remarkable difference in the O&D mix versus connects at Dallas versus any other place. Sounds like you've been studying this, but our intent would be to have Chicago, St. Louis, Phoenix, Baltimore, all of those very large operate \u2013 Houston, all of those very large operations look roughly the same. And I have not seen anything that says that it is remarkably different, and I certainly haven't seen anything so far to suggest that there is any disappointment whatsoever in Dallas. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. No. Hunter, this is Bob. And thanks for the question. I think a couple of things, our Dallas performance is right in line with system as Gary said. Now, we built Dallas up in a series sort of tranches of adding flights and so some groupings of flights are more mature than others. So, I'll tell you that the last couple of groupings that we added which are obviously younger are continuing to develop and we'll see that I'm confident over time, so there's still room for improvement in Dallas, even though it is right at system average. On the traffic mix, just because Dallas is constrained, always remember, we would love to have more flights in Dallas than we can have. And so, because of that, we're always going to bias for local traffic more than we would in an unconstrained large city like a Chicago for example. So we do, because we could have more capacity in Dallas. Dallas will always I think slightly underweight the flow and connect traffic compared to what it could be if we were not constrained, because we've got to make room for local traffic which again there is more local traffic demand than we have room for at the gates and flights that we have in Dallas. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hunter, the only thing, I would add to what we both said is that we're conscious of this. There are some analogies to Love Field around the country that I won't mention, but we do have techniques where we can influence one way or the other. So we're very happy with the way Dallas is performing. Again it's a constrained market as we know. So we'll have to continue to keep an eye on it. But I don't know if we're hitting the point on your question or not? Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. No it's \u2013 we can maybe take this offline, but that's \u2013 I want to ask another question. So that's good enough for now. Thank you for the time. And then if I back out the $125 million credit card benefit, it looks like unless some stuff moved around in the P&L which I'm not aware of, it look likes your other revenue grew by 35%. So first, is that right? And if so, what is that, you only mentioned EarlyBird up, whatever, 12%, and once we lap the credit card, how should we think about that other revenue growth rate in the third quarter and beyond, because again well, I'm just kind of curious of my, first of all, correct my underlying math, and how should we think about it beyond, once we lap the credit card? Thank you. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Hunter, I'll be happy to help with that. Yeah, we are seeing strong growth in our other \u2013 just as a remainder of our \u2013 just so you know where the components of the benefit from our credit card fall, if you will \u2013 about \u2013 the net is the $124 million, and other revenues were increased by about, call it, $175 million, and passenger revenues were decreased by about $50 million. So, I'm not sure if you did your math exactly right there, but that's the split of the net roughly $125 million benefit from Chase. But we're continuing to see strong ancillary revenues. We had strong EarlyBird revenues but again aside... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we had more bag fees, we had more Wi-Fi, we had more pets... Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There's a collection that your \u2013 I can't attest to your math either, but I am certain that we had a very strong growth in the \"group\" of ancillary revenue. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so, just... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I would think \u2013 I think your question was should that continue, Tammy, I would think that we would continue to see that. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think so, again, just with the caveat of course that we'll lapse the benefit of the chase benefit in July. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the time and the questions. I guess, Gary, you spoke about this in your prepared remarks, but one of the reasons you have been posting industry-leading revenues of late has been the maturation of many of your routes. As you look at the impact over the course of the year, do you think this maturation is having a bigger impact on revenues today or call it the first half of the year, or do you think this accelerates into the back half of the year? I guess, any color you can provide around the timing of that would be helpful. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Feels like it will trend away from us. So in other words, it's higher today than it should be a year from now. I also think that there is quite a bit of art work that we're debating internally about how to define a development market. So, we're seeing really broad strength in our cities. And, Bob, I don't think we call an additional frequency in a market that's existing, we don't call that \"development\". Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: No. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I think the impact is likely larger than the point that Tammy shared with you. I think all of our folks agree with that. So we may be a little bit conservative and that may be a conservative outlook as a consequence of that. But the other thing is \u2013 not only is the existing maturing, but we're also slowing down the pace of stuffing in new, and that's all intentional. So we'll have a pretty conservative year here in 2016 in terms of incremental flying that's being added between now and the end of the year, and that will help as well. So the tailwind should exist all year long. I think it will begin to diminish roughly a year from now. Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And I also just wanted to kind of touch upon the balance sheet and capital returns. I guess, with no change right now in terms of your CapEx spend, do you think we could see a pick-up in the pace of buybacks, particularly as I guess fuel stays a little bit lower for longer now. I guess maybe any color you could provide in terms of how you think about buybacks, returns to shareholders versus new growth at the company? Thanks. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. We are just continuing to balance all the above. We, as I mentioned, we'll be completing our current share reauthorization here next month. So we'll be taking up that question with the board here very soon. But as you can tell from our outlook, we're expecting our cash flows to continue to be very healthy this year, and as we've mentioned a number of times, we expect our capital expenditures to be very manageable, and we're continuing to be very committed to return value back to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, but you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we might do beyond this most recent $200 million accelerated share repurchase. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. The only thing that I would add to that very thorough answer is that obviously free cash flow is a very significant guardrail in the way we think about all this. And if you believe that our free cash flow is going to continue to grow, well then that just gives us more latitude to think about it. Likewise, if you're concerned that free cash flow may go the other way, well then that would influence us also. But it is very prominent in our thinking and the next step obviously is to wrap up the existing authorization, and then we'll revisit this question with the board. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. And just the only other comment I would add just to kind of round out the discussion is just on our leverage. We've been managing to kind of low-to-mid 30% range, and we don't really have any plans to change that at least at this juncture. Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, there. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Julie. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Gary, a question on growth. So there is still a lot of growth opportunity for you guys, including resurgence of short haul, international expansion out of Fort Lauderdale and Houston and eventually Hawaii. Does the changed fleet plan impact how you think about prioritizing that growth over the next two years? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I have to smile at Julie, because Bob Jordan is shaking his head, as you're talking about all these opportunities. He is lathering up here. I have to cool him off. I think we have a tactical challenge to work through a step down in the fleet in the late third quarter next year, I think, is the primary challenge. So by the end of the next year, by the end of 2018, we'll be back to our fleet plan. And we haven't given you a precise number there yet, so that's a little P plan. It's not etched in stone. But we'll work through all of that. In the meantime, it may affect a priority or two. It's a little premature to say. That's one of the reasons that we need to give our team this guidance now is because Bob Jordan and his commercial team are working right now on what the schedule will be in the fourth quarter of 2017, and they've got to know how many airplanes we're going to give them to schedule. So those are questions that we'll be immediately thrashing through. One thing that's a priority for next year that we won't waiver on is Fort Lauderdale completing the construction of the new international five-gate terminal and then following through the launch international flights there. So that will be a very high and hard priority for 2017 that we'll have to potentially work around as one example. But as I've said several times, I think that this is manageable and we can handle it, and we'll obviously get to work on it here. But, Bob, I don't see any change in priority because of that. (46:16), Bob... J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Is there a timing \u2013 go ahead, Bob. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : I agree with Gary. It's tactical. You've got a period of time where you have to manage our wants and our needs. A lot of what you mentioned, we're going to always pace our growth here. And so some of the things you mentioned are already in our sights 2018 or beyond anyway. So those are really unaffected because once you get into the mid-to-late 2018, we're sort of back to where we expected. So it's really just a short-term challenge, but it will be painful. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, it will... Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : It will definitely be painful. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll have hard decisions. And the thing that we've liked here in 2016, as a pretty vivid example, the plan that we had for this year did not include any new cities, and we will very likely have four as it turned out for 2016 with three Cuba cities and Long Beach. So it's nice to have that flexibility. Those four markets don't require a lot of aircraft time, but we did have enough in reserve where we could jump on those opportunities. So we may have to forego some things like that if they appear during that time period in 2017, 2018, but again we'll be able to manage and I don't think that this really impacts our strategy long-term. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And, Gary, can you just remind us the timing on the expansion out of Fort Lauderdale, if there is any update on the construction of the new facility? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't believe we have any new updates. It's first half of next year. I think a decent assumption, I think, that we've been sharing publicly is midyear but we don't have a precise date yet. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : And we'll go next to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I just wanted to ask about Houston. Since the international gates opened there, I've been a little surprised I think there's maybe up to 10 daily flights out of Houston internationally. Just wondering how may gates are you using there and what the plan is and maybe what similarities we might have as we think about the growth out of Fort Lauderdale International? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, and Mike can help me here or Bob for that matter. Let me give it a try and see if I'm answering your question. If not, please redirect this. But our rough estimate with five gates, assuming that we have access to five, we have four under lease and as long as the fifth is open and available to us, we can use five. So the capacity for five gates international flying is roughly 25 departures. And I think today we're maybe 11 international departures, 12 international departures out of Hobby. And I'm pretty sure that our folks at the airport will also use those gates as they need to for domestic flights. So I think if I'm understanding your question, we're where we expected to be by the way at Houston Hobby, not a year later. We're just months into operation there. We did not expect to be at capacity that fast. And I know Bob will continue to have Houston as a priority to continue to add international flights there in the future. I can't give you prediction and would not want to give you prediction yet as to when we might be at capacity in the terminal, but we've got plenty of capacity now. It's a great facility. Our customers absolutely love it, and we'll continue to have flights in Houston. Is that responsive to your question? Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks, Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And then Fort Lauderdale, I think again it's a little bit premature to tell you exactly what our plans are, but they're not similar from what I've described at least in concept. It's another five-gate facility. Bob, off the top of my head, I don't recall exactly how many gates we have access to. I believe it's all five. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's all five, yes. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's the same scenario as we have in Houston. So I'm going to guess that we have roughly the same 25 departure a day capacity there. And now Cuba, assuming that all gets approved, our request is to add flights out of Fort Lauderdale. So if we start Cuba flying this year, we'll already have some international flights even before the terminal opens, which was in our original plan. So Fort Lauderdale could ramp up faster than Houston has, I just don't know yet. It's a little bit premature to say. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Savi, the only other thing to add is the, because we have a lot of local traffic out of Houston, which is fantastic, we have probably even more flow and connect than we expected, which is also fantastic. So we're really happy. It's right on what we expected. Fort Lauderdale and Houston there will be some synergy. When Fort Lauderdale opens, because you will have flight schedules that work together, because it's also a gateway. So you will have customers that connect over Fort Lauderdale that could potentially have a return flight that connects over Houston. So they will actually complement each other in terms of the schedule for folks who are connecting in those airports. So that's a great thing as well. So the Fort Lauderdale will help Houston and Houston will help Fort Lauderdale. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And if I may just follow-up on the unit revenue front, Tammy, I know you provided color. So if I'm thinking about 2Q correctly, you do have a nice \u2013 a slowdown in capacity I'm guessing, should help unit revenue and you have easier comparisons and possibly the only headwind being the Easter shift. Am I thinking about that correctly? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I wouldn't dispute any of that, Savi. I think you're thinking about that exactly, right. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks very much. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. As I look at your cash flow statement, Tammy, you've got air traffic liability declining on a year-on-year basis from $717 million last March to $685 million this March, and you've got 5.5% more capacity growth. Should I be worried about that decline? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, not at all, Helane. So there's no concerns. Just based on our outlook and just our cost outlook and feel we're expecting healthy cash flows, and no concerns on the air traffic liability. Of course, you've got to take into considerations the Rapid Rewards impact of that. But when you adjust for that, there is nothing unusual going on there. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you. And then my other question is with respect to \u2013 I'm sorry, I haven't paid attention to this. Is there anything new at Love Field with respect to Delta and their access to your gates, your one gate? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, there is nothing new there. Where it stands is the judge ruled and Southwest is in the process of appealing that ruling. So there is really no new news and nothing further to discuss on that. But I was just kind of curious by your cash flow question on air traffic liability. I'll bet you that it's just a timing of Easter. Where all... Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: That could be. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...burned off earlier, but you asked a good question... Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But everything looks really good. But... Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, there is... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...I am analytically kind of curious about your question. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And one other just point on our air traffic liability. We've also seen that grow just simply because we're publishing our schedule out a little further. So there's a few things that are impacting that on a year-over-year basis. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Are you seeing any trends in air fares that you could comment on; improving, staying the same, declining, maybe that's an effective air traffic liability? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think so. Well, it's a very competitive environment and I'm very pleased with our results, especially in light of that. The comps are a little distorted because of the credit card deal and accounting change, but I will say, I think, Tammy, that consistent with what we're reporting on today, which are booking trends and revenue trends for April, there is nothing new to report there. So the trends are continuing; not better, not worse. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. That's all fair. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : And we have time for one more question today. We'll take our final question from David Fintzen with Barclays. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just on the Classics, how practically do you expect to do this. Do you want to fly them as long as you can before the MAX shows up and have one big wave of retirements or should we be thinking about a step down as you get closer? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, no. We have to have every pilot trained to sit in every cockpit. And so it's all or nothing is the way that this has been presented to us. Now we don't know exactly what training requirements Boeing and the FAA and Southwest would ultimately work out, but we can't wait that long to develop a training program and then get all of our pilots through it. So, no, there will be a day and one day we'll be flying 50 Classics and the next day we'll be flying zero. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. It will be a hard stop. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It will be a hard stop and so in reference to Julie's earlier question, that's really the task at hand is to figure out how to smoothly do that. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I'm confident we can. It will be painful, but we'll try to at least seasonally it steps down post Labor Day. So we have less flying in September than we do early August anyway. So we'll manage it and there will be a little bit of pain, but hopefully, we'll be able to contain that and get over it and then about a year later, it'll all be behind us. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : David, I think a way to think about it is, when we put the last AirTran aircraft down at the end of 2014, we put them down in a lump and we began a new schedule the next day and that is exactly the way we're going to manage this. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I think Bob makes it \u2013 I'm so glad you mentioned that, because the point is, we have had practice at this and know how to do it. And I don't think the world knew a thing. We knew it internally. But we got through it and everything worked out just fine. So, I think, like I said, I think we can manage it and I'm not overly concerned about it. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : To Bob's point and Gary's point, if I remember correctly that was about 27 airplanes. So, again, we believe this is all very manageable. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Shifting gears a little bit, Long Beach, I know it's a small new city opened, but can you talk a little bit? Obviously well established in California. How does the launch fit in? Is that somewhere you'd like to turn into more full-size Southwest city or what happens there? Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think we're ecstatic to get a foothold into Long Beach here. So we had no avenue for a long time. And so just to be able to have a modest schedule to Oakland is great. The airport interacts really well with our other LA area service. So we don't feel like there will be a cannibalism or anything like that. So I think this will really be new traffic for us. Obviously there are constraints. We'd love to have more flights over time. I don't see a case where we would add dozens and dozens of additional flights, but if we could get another two, another four over time, I think that would be wonderful because I think the traffic is there. Our bookings look good. We're really happy with the traffic build so far and we're looking forward to starting service. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And you probably know this, David, but we're the number one airline in the five-county area... David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...among the four airports. So I think this will be really awesome. We'll be able to provide more flexibility to customers to go out of one airport and back to another. And if we can get more slots, we would love to do that. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And if I can sneak one last one in about geography and RASM performance. I would think California best, Houston worse. Is that right or is just any color around what you're seeing around the country? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're seeing California as strong and we're seeing just general strength across the network and as we've called out before, just we have had a high percentage of our markets under development over the last year. So, some of those markets that have come on more recently, those are ramping up, but no, general strength across the system. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I think you're referring I guess to oil and gas and... David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Houston looks fantastic, Midland looks fantastic. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we're just not (1:00:36) the impact. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, our business is held up quite well, I think it would be fair to say that it's not as strong as it was, but it's still really strong. So I feel real good about that. But I agree with Tammy's first reaction, which is it's mostly a function of where we have developing markets. So I think our strength is very, very broad and very consistent across the U.S. And again, we're really pleased, we're pleased with our network. It's been under construction for years and the results look really good, revenue management has done a phenomenal job in a very competitive environment. And the marketing, I think is just \u2013 no one has asked us about it, but I think the marketing and the messaging has been absolutely superb, presenting Southwest competitive advantages in a very clear and colorful way. And they're going continue on that course and I think it's going to continue to drive strong revenues for us as well. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just one clarification on a place like Midland, are you talking sort of absolute performance or is that relative to the system right now when you say fantastic? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolute, absolute performance, oh, yeah. It's very good, it's not as good as it was, but... David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Okay, that's what, yeah, that's what I was trying to make sure that I was... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We've been clear about that, but it is still very, very good and the same applies to Houston. David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford - Vice President Communication & Outreach: Good day, Tom. We can go ahead and get started, if you want to give instructions on how to queue up for questions. Operator : Yes, ma'am. We'll take our first question from Susan Carey with The Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Hey, everybody. Two little ones. Tammy, you mentioned earlier that this operating margin in the first quarter of 19.7% was the highest in I believe you said 35 years, is that correct? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That is correct. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: And is this, what was your pre-tax margin in the quarter, or is this the pre-tax margin? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That was our operating margin. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: I know, I'm really... Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Our pre-tax... Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: ...obsessed lately with pre-tax? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Pre-tax was 18.7%. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: 18.7%. And secondly I noticed that you give kind of your guidance in terms of RASM. So you guys don't break out PRASM guidance? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. We don't, but that's simply because of the \u2013 as a distortions that the impact of our Chase co-brand agreement has, because of the reclassifications resulting from just the accounting change of that, it's much more meaningful just to provide it at a RASM level. So you are correct, we're just providing guidance based on RASM. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We did, Susan, provide PRASM guidance until third quarter last year... Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Until third quarter, yeah. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : When it got confusing because of this new credit card deal, and it changed the accounting, and so it rendered the PRASM numbers irrelevant. But maybe one of these days, Tammy will get back to that. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I can certainly \u2013 I'd be happy to walk you through that if you're... Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Because you gave us the actual PRASM number of minus 3.6% in the current \u2013 the guidance. I mean, the... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Release. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: The release. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And Susan, if you backed out the Chase benefit, PRASM would have been down 2.4%. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Okay. Okay. It's fair enough. Thank you so much. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News Inc.: Guys, thanks for the time. I just was wondering if there was any comment on what a stronger Alaska with the pending acquisition of Virgin America means for Southwest, both in the California market, but then also at Love Field and what the potential with the two gates Virgin currently has there is? Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet, Conor. No, we really don't have a comment on that. And we'll wait to see what the government approval process reveals and if there are assets that are for sale, we'll obviously do our duty and take a look at them, but otherwise I don't have any comment on that. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Hi, Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi David. David Koenig - The Associated Press : You said just a minute ago that Houston and Midland are performing, I think fantastic was the word you used, right. That seems to be very different from the United's experience right now in Houston. So why are you doing well there and they are not, is it different type of passenger or what can you say to explain that? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we don't really compare ourselves to United, first of all. So, I don't know that I have an explanation. You might ask United that question, but we have had great success in Houston in particular over the past four years as we have been working with the city to reestablish international service at Houston Hobby. That generated a significant amount of grassroots support locally to convince the city to add that service, which we were very pleased with. What we had discovered at the time when we started this in 2012 is that the air fares, especially internationally out of Bush were extraordinarily high, double \u2013 in fact the air fares compared even to Chicago on the same airline to points south. So, I think what we've been able to do is build a brand new five gate terminal, and the City of Houston and the community are very excited about that. We've been able to add a lot of new flights at lower fares, and the community has been very excited about that. And our low costs are such that we can offer that very profitably. We have a decades long business built up in Houston, including connecting it to Midland, and we just have a real strong franchise there. We have a lot of loyal customers; we have a lot of Rapid Reward members. So, anywhere from a third to 40% of our customers fly on us on business. So, I can assure you it's not because we don't have business customers, we probably carry more business customers in the United States than any other airline. But I would just attribute it again to great service by our people, the great network that we offer, they are offering a great product, excellent on time performance. And we've really made a very significant investment in the community, and I think the community is appreciative of that. David Koenig - The Associated Press : And can you say how much of the what you're seeing there is due to the international flying you're now doing out of Hobby? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the international component in fairness to your question is relatively small. I believe, Bob, we've got about 160 daily departures, so what, 5% of that would be international. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Right. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So it's small but it's new product, it's exciting, it causes people in Houston to take notice, and maybe to try Southwest when they haven't flown on us in a while, so there is a halo effect. If you look back, Bob, over a five-year time period, we've added quite a few new domestic nonstops as well. I want to say we have added Newark and LaGuardia, Boston. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President : Boston... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I'm sure there are more David that I just can't recall, but I guess the point is we are growing in Houston, we have made a very significant commitment, we're adding new product, where our people are doing a great job, and we just have a lot of momentum. So I don't know how that compares to our competitors in the market, but I don't sense that they have momentum. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay. Thanks very much. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And you can just talk to them to figure out why that is I guess. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.: Thank you very much. At what point do you see faster yields for domestic travel becoming positive? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll let Tammy explain that, but we are predicting positive unit revenues in the second quarter. So, we were actually slightly positive, although in fairness I call it flat, but we were actually up 0.1%. So, I'm not answering your question literally, but it's a little more complicated than that, but I would say that the substantive answer to your question is, we are already seeing that. But Tammy, you want to explain? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. So, if you're referring to our yields per revenue passenger mile... Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.: Yes, yes. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would just attribute that to, as we mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see a very competitive environment, and I would characterize that as weak, but we've been offsetting that with a strong demand for our service. And so, that's netting to \u2013 we had a flat unit revenue performance in the first quarter and then as we've guided, we're expecting that to turn positive here in the second quarter based on our current trends. So, I don't know that I can specifically answer when we're going to see our yields turn positive, but what we really focus on of course is our unit revenues and our outlook for unit revenues is favorable here in the second quarter. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So in other words, the yields are distorted year-over-year due to an accounting change and you can make a lot of sense out of that, I was redirecting you just to look at total revenues per available seat mile I think is a better way to evaluate our performance right now. Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.: Right. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And you can see that in our fares, our fares were down year-over-year by about $4 on average and that's even with an increased stage length. So, which supports the weak yield environment, but we've been generating record load factors and again offsetting that by strong demand. Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.: Great. Thank you. I guess two, three follow-ups. One, has the airports where capacity has exceeded demand changed or is it the same that's it's been for the past several months? And then secondly, I guess could you characterize corporate bookings in particular? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, yeah, I would say that the main thing that's happening, I don't know how much of the analyst call you listened to, but the main thing that's been happening over the course of the last 12 months is that we had grown aggressively in 2014 and 2015 and added a lot of new markets. So, let's call those developing markets. Those markets have begun to mature. And I think that addresses your question about capacity exceeding demand. So, virtually all of our markets now are performing well where we feel pretty good about the capacity that we have relative to the demand and the markets where we're continuing to see \u2013 which are very many, but those markets where we're seeing softness, they're the same corporates. So, they're mostly in that development stage, they're new, we're creating awareness with customers, trying to get people to fly us and that's all very, very expected. There are fewer of those today than there were a year ago. Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.: And on the corporate booking side, it's strong or I guess how would you characterize it? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would characterize that as strong. We're seeing a growth in our corporate sales in the high single-digit percent range. So, I would characterize that our corporate bookings are strong, as well as our business mix, our business mix, we've seen really no change there that represents about a third of our passengers. Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.: Great. Thank you, both. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with Flightglobal. Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the time. I have a question about just the ongoing difference in opinion with the pilots unions over whether their contract is going to allow for the operation of the 737 MAX, has that been resolved and how has today's (1:15:27) with the Classics changed that? Thanks. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The Boeing 737-8 is covered by our contract and we are working with Boeing to put that aircraft into service next year. Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal: Okay. Do you have more clarity on when you plan to take delivery of the first aircraft and when you would be placing in revenue service? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Boeing has told us and I believe they've stated publicly that they're comfortable with their contractual commitment, which with us is the third quarter of next year. There have been rumors that they might actually have the aircraft earlier and obviously we continued to have conversation with Boeing. But our plan, which we reiterated this morning with our Classic announcement is that we'll plan to put it into revenue service after Labor Day next year. So, we're anxious to get our hands on the airplane and put it through its proving runs and get all of our training done in advance of that, but that will be our plans. But as far as we know, so far, everything looks really good, looks like it's going to be a great airplane. Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal: Okay. So, just one quick follow-up. In the event that the FAA training requirements for the MAX are not finalized say about May, does that impact your entry into service for the aircraft? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, let me be clear on that and Mike, I'll let you comment here too. The May information, the May date that we shared with you was relative to training for both the MAX and the Classic aircraft. Since we are now not going to be flying the Classic that vastly simplifies the training and we do know the training that's required for the MAX or the 737-8 I should say, and that training is very small and that is in development, but that will be done and ready well in advance of May of next year. Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, do you have a date when you're going to start that training? Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : No, not yet. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But it will be \u2013 the differences between the 737-8 and the 737-800 are very modest and we're very comfortable with that. We'll be ready and approved by the FAA and approved by Boeing. Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal: Okay. Thank you so much. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg. Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief/Correspondent- Bloomberg News : Thank you. Gary, excuse me, the Wall Street Journal has had a story that Boeing is considering yet another version of the 737, and that it would be dubbed as 737 MAX 7X and would fly quite a bit distance further. Have you guys been in talks at all with Boeing about that and do you have any idea at all whether that might be something that you would convert some of your pending orders to? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mary, I'm going to let our good friend Mike Van de Ven answer that question. Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Mary, there has been no decisions from Boeing about \u2013 we have firm orders, as you know for 30 of the 737-7 versions of that and there have been no decisions or agreements or thoughts on Boeing on adjusting those firm orders at this point in time. Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief/Correspondent- Bloomberg News : Okay. Are you familiar with this new version that they are talking about? Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I've heard rumors, but that there are... Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief/Correspondent- Bloomberg News : Okay. Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : But we're not in a position to comment about any of it. Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief/Correspondent- Bloomberg News : Okay. Is it something that you would look at, I mean, I realize you said, you haven't made a decision of any kind, but is this something that you would look at and consider? Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, absolutely. We would want to go consider different options out there. Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief/Correspondent- Bloomberg News : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda Rutherford - Vice President Communication & Outreach: Thanks a lot Tom. If anybody has any follow-up questions, you know where to find the Communications Department 214-792-4847 or www.swamedia.com. Have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram David Koenig - The Associated Press Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review- Journal Operator : Welcome to the Southwest Airlines' Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. My name is Tom and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand - Managing Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter 2016 results. Joining the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements, because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marcy, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 PM, there was a network equipment failure and the planned redundancy or backup failed as well, and this hindered the recovery efforts, and especially with some of our older legacy systems. Ultimately, the network was virtually fully recovered and restored around 12 hours later, roughly 1 AM or 2 AM this morning. And since then, the operation and that is airplanes and flight crews and customer re-accommodations have been working to catch up. I want to apologize to all our customers that were affected yesterday and today, this is absolutely not the kind of service that our customers expect or what we expect of ourselves. And of course our 50,000 employees, jobs to serve our customers became significantly more difficult as a result of the computer failure, and I do want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their collective efforts to recover, those efforts have been truly heroic. So, hopefully after a day of recovery, things will be back to normal tomorrow morning. Tammy's going to take us through the quarterly results and I just wanted to point out a couple of highlights. First of all, we had a record performance in many ways, traffic, revenues, load factor, earnings, return on invested capital; it was a very strong quarter also in terms of customer service and operations. Next, we had very solid revenue growth on 4.8% growth in capacity, and that was driving industry leading but modest unit revenue growth of 0.6%, and that was in line with our expectations. Revenue trends have been up and down all year. Now we're seeing softer fare trends in July, August, and notably with close-in bookings, given overall industry revenue and capacity trends that we've been monitoring, none of this is shocking, but it is disappointing. We're still anticipating strong third quarter margins and profits, strong cash flows and continuing shareholder returns, but we will need to factor these softer trends into our future plans. So, for now, our second half 2016 plans are unchanged, but we'll continue to look carefully and evaluate our 2017 growth plans. 2017 is going to be an exciting year; we have the 737-8 being launched next year, we've got new technology being deployed next year, we are opening an international terminal at Fort Lauderdale, we've gotten our preliminary approvals to serve three cities in Cuba, and we have an outstanding request to add Mexico service to LAX. So a lot of exciting things going on and certainly 2017 is going to be a very big year. I want thank our people for all their hard work and the tremendous success in driving these results, and also congratulate them on another quarter of record profit sharing. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the quarter. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million, and excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% year-over-year to a record $757 million and we grew our earnings per share almost 16% to $1.19. This was a little shy of consensus, but it was right in line with our expectation and the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day. Our operating margin of over 23% represents a 36-year high performance. And we grew our pre-tax ROIC excluding special items for the 12 months ended June by more than five points to 33.5%. I'd just like to also join Gary in congratulating our outstanding employees on our 13th consecutive quarter of record profits, excluding special items and their record quarterly profit sharing of $206 million. This brings our profit sharing accrual to $361 million for the first half of the year alone. Second quarter revenue performance was a significant driver of these strong results. Our operating revenues grew 5.3% and our passenger revenues once again grew to record levels. The growth in our revenues exceeded our capacity growth, resulting in unit revenue growth of 0.6%, which was in line with our guidance. This RASM performance outperformed the industry and on a stage-length adjusted basis, our RASM performance was even better. Despite the challenging fare environment, our core business was solid, with strong demand for our low fares. Load factors were at record levels throughout the quarter and we closed second quarter with a record load factor of 85.6%. Revenues related to Rapid Rewards continue to be very strong. Our second quarter results reflect a net benefit of approximately $135 million related to the amendment of our Chase agreement, effective in July last year. Our strong revenue performance was also supported by continued growth in other ancillary revenues. Corporate sales were also strong, although at softer yields. We continued to benefit from tailwinds from our development markets, and we're very pleased with their performance, especially in light of the challenging fare environment. International markets continued to perform in line with our expectations, with several of them producing revenue results well above system averages. Our freight revenues were in line with second quarter of last year. So, to close revenue, we are very pleased with our record operating performance. So turning to our third quarter revenue outlook. Thus far, traffic and booking trends remain strong, but the fare environment continues to be a challenge. We're seeing heavy discounting in fares including close-in, which as we noted in the release has softened in recent weeks. Based on these trends and our current bookings and including the yield trends we're expecting third quarter RASM to decline in the 3% to 4% range year-over-year. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing benefit from the Chase amendment and 2Q's approximately $135 million benefit is a reasonable run rate for 3Q. But we won't see the 2 point to 3 point year-over-year RASM improvement in future quarters, of course, as we've lapped the July 2015 amendment date. We currently expect third quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from third quarter 2015. And now, I'll move over to our cost performance. Our second quarter costs were right in line with our expectation. Our operating unit cost excluding special items decreased modestly year-over-year, largely from lower jet fuel prices. Despite a 4.8% increase in our capacity, our fuel gallons only increased 4.1%, reflecting our fuel efficiency gains, largely from our fuel modernization efforts. Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 10.4%, to the lower end of our guidance of $1.80 to $1.85. And based on our market prices as of Monday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.05. We're also currently forecasting that level for fourth quarter. This brings our estimate for the full-year 2016 to the $1.90 to $1.95 range, which is down a bit, due to the recent drop in market prices. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio beyond third quarter 2016, based on prices as of Monday, is a net liability of approximately $775 million. And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our second quarter unit costs were also in line with guidance, up approximately 2% year-over-year. This increase is due largely to the acceleration of the depreciation of the Classic fleet, the timing of advertising and technology investments along with airframe maintenance. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to also increase approximately 2% year-over-year. Roughly 1 point of that year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirement with the remainder associated with increased salary, wages and benefits costs from ratified agreement since third quarter 2015 as well as costs associated with technology projects. For full-year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation. And I am going to move now to our balance sheet and cash flow and I'll just make a few quick comments regarding the strength of our balance sheet and as well as our cash flows. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. As we reported at Investor Day, we deferred $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx to beyond 2020 as a result of our recently restructured order book with Boeing. Our capital spending remains on track to reach approximately $2 billion this year, with $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx and about $650 million in non-aircraft capital spend. With operating cash flows of $2.7 billion, thus far this year, and manageable capital spend, our free cash flow has remained strong, enabling us to continue to return value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. To quickly recap, what we discussed at Investor Day. Last month, we completed our previous $1.5 billion buyback authorization with a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program in May and launched a $500 million ASR under our new $2 billion program, which was authorized by our board back in May. We completed that ASR last month and we intend to launch another $250 million accelerated share repurchase here soon. Once launched, we have returned $1.6 billion to shareholders this year and we will have a $1.25 billion remaining under our authorization. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low-to-mid 30% range. And I'll just make a few comments on our fleet, but we have not had any changes to our plans since we announced the restructuring of our order book with Boeing last month at Investor Day. We ended the quarter as planned with 719 aircraft in our fleet and continue to anticipate ending the year with the fleet of 723 aircraft. We are still managing to an average annual net fleet growth for the three years ended 2018 of no more than 2%. And as Gary has mentioned, our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. While we continue to evaluate a rate of capacity growth beyond 2016, especially in light of the current revenue environment, we still expect annual capacity growth in 2017 and 2018 to be less than this year. We remain disciplined and our approach to growth with a focus, of course, on flexibility to adjust, if needed, with a goal to preserve our strong returns and margins. And now just to quickly recap for you. This was another quarter of record profits, outstanding margins and strong cash flows. Demand for low fares is strong and we continue to produce record load factors. The revenue yield environment remains challenging with heavy fare discounting. We are working hard to control costs and this year's inflation and non-fuel cost is explained almost entirely by the depreciation associated with our accelerated retirement, and we still expect cost savings and an EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Lower fuel prices continue to benefit earnings, but second quarter earnings would've improved with or without the benefit of lower fuel prices. Our balance sheet is strong as ever, and our commitment to return value to shareholders is unchanged, having already returned as much in the first half of 2016 as we did in all of 2015. And of course, we also announced in this release, our intentions to launch a $250 million ASR. Our capital spending remains in check and are very manageable, and pre-tax return on invested capital was just phenomenal at 33.5%. As we look ahead to third quarter, we are expecting another quarter of strong margins. And with that overview, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for another fantastic quarter and for their extraordinary efforts over the last 24 hours. So, Tom, with that, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. And thank you for waiting. We'll begin with our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Hey, Gary, I appreciate your comments about 2017, I think you said you're monitoring the situation closely and obviously trying to determine what the right amount of capacity growth will be for next year. But when I look at sort of the guidance for the latter part of 2016, I think fuel's going to be up year-over-year, CASM's going to be up and it also looks like RASM could be down a bit. Why no change or move away from the 5% to 6% growth for this year? I mean is it a systems issue that you can't change the schedule for the latter part of 2016, or what's holding you up, or maybe preventing that, any color, your thoughts on that that'd be great? Thanks. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, and sure Mike, and a very logical question, one that we know that we're going to get from you all here today. We're different than the industry. So, we don't publish 330 days' worth of inventory and the other aspect of the \u2013 our competitors' approach is they mostly over-schedule. So, they'll publish more, they'll claw that back and we just don't use that technique as you know. We don't publish as much inventory and what we do publish we very much intend to fly. So, we rarely go out into a published schedule and make changes. It is easier for us to hold a few flights in reserve and then publish them later, as opposed to taking flights out and re-accommodating customers. So, it is a \u2013 I don't know if it's so much a philosophy, but it is certainly a practice that we've used. The modeling that we've been \u2013 and second, the trends that we are complaining about this morning are very recent, and that's one reason that I mentioned to you all in my opening remarks is that we've seen inconsistent trends over the first seven months of the year. Really going back to December, Tammy, I think of last year. So, we don't know that weeks will make a trend, the bookings right now for the fall were quite good. I wouldn't want you to conclude that that means that we're predicting positive unit revenue comparisons yet in the fourth quarter, but what I mentioned earlier that I was disappointed, that is our goal, our goal is to have positive unit revenue growth every single quarter and certainly for this year. We're falling short of that right now for the third quarter and that obviously will give us a cause to rethink our plans. The final point is, as we have discussed this in recent weeks about the opportunity to reduce the schedule primarily in the fourth quarter, we've not been able to model a scenario where it was profit positive for us to do that. And so this \u2013 in dealing with these incremental capacity choices, we think that actually would be harmful to Southwest in the near term as opposed to helpful. So I think the more productive work effort for us right now, on July 21, is to think about our next schedules and what our plans are for 2017. So hopefully that's responsive to your question. Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's very helpful. When does that next schedule roll out? What's the next schedule rollout date for you guys? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Bob, what are you working on right now? Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : We're working on the basically the spring break \u2013 post-spring break period, and that'll be published here in the next couple of months. Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Very helpful. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Bob. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Tammy, what does your 3% to 4% guidance assume as we enter the shoulder periods? One of the other carriers gave guidance that assumes some improvement in September. Are you also assuming a similar improvement or are you more cautious as we enter into shoulder periods, I know a lot of these changes have been rather recent but just trying to figure out what your base case is in the down 3% to down 4%? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Julie. Yeah, as we look forward, September does look to be a little bit easier comparison. But what our current forecast represents is really just a continuation of the trends that we're seeing here more recently. So, as we updated you at Investor Day, we knew our year-over-year comparisons were going to be difficult here in the second half, simply because of the lapse of the Chase agreements, but we have factored in the recent softening that we've seen particularly in our close-in bookings. So, we've \u2013 it's our best guess on our current trends, and obviously, we'll keep you updated as we move along here in the quarter. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And is there a tailwind from developing markets in the third quarter guidance or has that lapped at this point? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's lapped largely simply because we're getting back down to a more normal percentage of development market as a percentage of ASMs. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But year-over-year, yes, the developing markets are definitely down, but they're being overcome, if you will, that improvement is being overcome by increasing fare competition. So, obviously the industry is continuing to add capacity every month. And we can get the traffic, but we have to work hard with fares do that. The nice thing is we're seeing, in terms of more positives, we're seeing good strength with our corporate sales, very nice growth there, our Rapid Rewards program continues to grow very nicely, and those are sort of outside of the \"fare environment\" and then our ancillary products continue to grow. And that's primarily EarlyBird and the upgraded boarding product. So, we have a couple of tools. And I guess the other thought was that freight was relatively soft in the second quarter. So, hopefully, there'll be some opportunities to regain some growth with the cargo business there. So we'll have a number of things that we'll be looking at to try to boost revenues, but certainly as time goes by here this year, the tailwind of the developing markets, I agree with Tammy, it's going to continue to wane, but we have some \u2013 we're 4% in development this year, and I think this time last year, it was closer to 20%. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Julie, just to be clear, back to your question on trends. What was implicit in my comments on September is that we would assume a little bit of improvement there just simply because of comparisons, but we've done our best to extrapolate current trends out into the full quarter. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then have you guys talked about how much of your booking curve is weighted towards this close-in period, where you're seeing the weakness? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. We haven't. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think we've talked about it. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We haven't shared that, Julie. J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Hey, thanks for the question. So mine is real simple, can you give us a sense today for quite simply how you're going to grow, what the growth rate is in 2017 or even in the first quarter, as we try and model revenue and perhaps a recovery from this softer spot? What should we be punching into models for next year? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : What I can give you right now to help you out is what we have through what we've got published with our schedules. So we are currently published through early March next year and our scheduled ASMs are up in probably the 6% range, and February I think is up a couple of percent for February. So that's where we are and as Gary indicated earlier, we're in the process of evaluating beyond that period. So I just don't have a forecast to give you beyond what's out there in the published schedule. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Okay. How about the latest on when you park these Classics, what date should we assume for that and what is the \u2013 I guess, we'll hang around the basket and wait for you to publish at least a full first quarter, but how should we be thinking about the cadence quarterly from that point forward? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll be retiring our Classics fleet here, as you know, between now and October 1, 2017. So \u2013 and as we described earlier, we'll be down to a manageable number of Classic and you can think of it as those being all out of our fleet by our fourth quarter schedule. So, we're still working through all of the details on that. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : So would ASM growth be higher or lower for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q than this mid-singles rate that we're at now? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, all else being equal, just simply because of the fleet, you would expect that to go down now. Again, Duane, we're just working through all of the details for next year's schedule. So, as we sit here today, I'm just not in a position to give you exact year-over-year ASM guidance for next year. But as we go through the year and as we work through the Classics, particularly in the second half, all else being equal, you would expect that to bend down. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Okay. And if we think about how Southwest revenue might hold up in a downturn, obviously there's a lot of data from prior cycles, but are you more of a corporate carrier, more reliant on that close-in customer today, given all the progress that you've made on that side of the business, than maybe prior downturns? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think so. What's interesting is, if you go back 20 years, we were, as you know, such a short-haul carrier. And I think what a lot of people misunderstood back in the 1990s is how much business travel we had, and some of that again was very natural with the short-haul orientation we had with high frequencies, those were convenient schedules that were built for business customers. So I don't \u2013 if anything, I'll bet you that we're less reliant on business customers today than we were 20 years ago. Business travel, as you know, is very sensitive to the cycle, and \u2013 if that's where you're going with your question. The other tool that we have today to help manage through softer periods is we just have better connecting capabilities, and a lot higher load factors today than we did 20 years ago. So, I still think that we're very well positioned for a change in the cycle. I think we're obviously a low-cost producer, and have a low-fare brand, we have a very loyal brand, and people do travel during recessions, they just look for more bargains. So, generally that's worked very well in our favor in the past. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Thanks, Gary, for those thoughts. I mean, do you think that's where we are or is this industry dysfunction on pricing? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, I was just trying to be responsive to your question. No, I don't think that's where we are. I think GDP growth is pretty steady. It's \u2013 you all know all the macros, real GDP is 2%-plus and domestic industry seats are up closer to 5%. So, I think that's not anything new, we've been talking about that for quite some time. And as I mentioned in my remarks, I don't think it's shocking that we find this sort of ebbs and flows of fares. But right now, it's \u2013 we are at a spot where, in particular with the close-in pricing, fares are softer than what we were expecting. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. You spoke earlier about the expectation to get back to positive RASM, or the hope, I should say, to get back to positive RASM in the fourth quarter. Can you speak to what you're seeing perhaps in your forward bookings and the potential revenue levers that you all have that could allow that to happen? Just sort of curious of the puts and takes there. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm glad you asked me the question. So, let me try to make sure that I'm being clear. I am not predicting positive RASM, I'm not remotely suggesting that, that is a possibility based on what we're seeing right now. I'm simply acknowledging to you all that that is our goal, that was our goal for the year and we're falling short of that goal and we can't be happy about that, that's all I was trying to point out. What we are able to do, in the meantime, of course, is continue to sustain very strong profits. We're enjoying low fuel prices and very strong operating margins are our expectation here for the third quarter. I don't have any reason to believe that that will change in the fourth quarter, but we have initiatives that come online in 2017 that bring with them the opportunity to boost our revenue production. So, we're in a period here between now and then, where we're just going to have to focus on blocking and tackling good revenue management, excellent customer service, tweaking our route network to try to use those levers here for the next several quarters. I think all the capacity questions that we're getting here today are very appropriate and that's something that we're going to have to take a very close look at. I agree with Tammy's point earlier, if that is one of the main levers that we have, we're just not prepared to give any 2017 guidance yet. And of course, I'll just remind everybody that last year, when we did guidance well in advance, it was \u2013 I think it was somewhat misunderstood. So, we've got to work to do in 2017, we've got the goal to boost unit revenues in 2017 and based on third quarter trends, we've got a little work to do. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that, Gary. And then, I guess a follow up for Tammy. The maintenance line has been relatively elevated in terms of year-over-year growth for the past, I guess, three quarters now. How should we think about that line trending in the back half of the year and would you anticipate giving some relief there as you retire the Classic fleet and take delivery of your next gen aircraft next year? Just sort of how should we think about the maintenance line trending going forward? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Thanks, Jack. Yeah, the maintenance \u2013 our maintenance costs, you'll continue to see that trending down as we retire the Classic fleet and I would expect our maintenance unit costs in the third quarter to show some improvement as well. So we'll continue to see a relief in that as we retire our Classic and so we're \u2013 that should be a favorable trend as we move forward. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you again for the time. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Tammy, I'm sorry. Can you please clarify, what you said before about the capacity question, you said something about 6% and a couple percent; I just pulled capacity data in Diio and it looks like you guys are growing ASMs by 1.6% in 1Q 2017, is that not right? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We... Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, that's not right. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, that's not right. We don't have March. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : A couple of things. We don't have March published and then you also have the impact of leap year here this year. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : So, I think it's just probably missing the month. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So, just to be clear, when you said 6%, Tammy's, then a couple percent, I'm just \u2013 what were you saying, how much you're growing, was that just like a January, February number? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, those were just January and February. So, January probably up in, would you agree 6% range in February, up year-over-year a couple of percent. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, because of leap year. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Because of leap year. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Of course, okay. Is there a scenario where you see Southwest growing capacity less than GDP next year? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that would be hard to do. I'm sure that just taking your question literally, I'm sure that there is a scenario. I wouldn't want you to think that it's a likely one, but as I think we pointed out, we don't want to \u2013 we don't see a compelling reason to tinker with the capacity that's published, certainly for the third quarter or the fourth quarter. So, these are recent trends and not ones that we're happy with. And so, as I think we've said several times, we've got some work to do. And as we typically do, we'll provide more guidance for the capacity plans here in the fourth quarter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much you have seen the fare environment change from, I guess, your little bit more positive commentary at Investor Day until today. Maybe can you give us some order of magnitude in terms of how much weaker close-in yields are right now as opposed to where they were on average in 2Q and I guess, what can Southwest do to try to fix this problem? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, and as I'm assuming you know well it's \u2013 forecasting airline revenues is always treacherous. So, basically what happens is trends get extrapolated, there is \u2013 we'll start a month with half of the bookings in place that we would expect for that month. So, it's not necessarily a ground up \u2013 from the ground up kind of a forecast. I would say that the guidance that Tammy is offering today for the third quarter unit revenues of down 3% to 4% is much less than what we thought at Investor Day. So we've \u2013 in a short period of time in another words, we've reduced our forecast by 1.5 points to 2 points. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 2 points. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So to 2 points. Now, that's mostly weaker revenues that we're seeing here for July, August. There was a question earlier about September. September does look better than July, August, but it's not anything that we're willing to tell you that you can take to the bank at all. So, the trend could change. We could be overly pessimistic here, it is most of the change in the trend as, again we've attributed it a number of times here today to the close-in bookings. And that is just simply saying that our \u2013 we have a lot of competitors out there the week of travel that are offering very hot fares, and we must match to get that traffic, it's just that simple. So that is a change in technique and a change in trend for us. The all-in result is still quite good, still falling, still \u2013 as I said before, it's just below our goal. The only other thing that I would mention is that there is a consistent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenues. Going back now all the way to probably the second half of 2014 when we began to see lower fuel prices. So, we're off-trend in the third quarter compared to second quarter, and the second quarter is also off trend compared to where we would expect to be relative to the first quarter. So these are, not having talked to you a lot personally, we call these sequential trends; you probably use the same term or technique. And that is basically the technique that we are using to arrive at this prediction of down 3% to 4% in the third quarter. So, we'll take steps to try to arrest these trends and to get back to positive unit revenue comparisons and again, as I've said a couple of times, we've got quite a bit of work to do to try to \u2013 to get back there, at least here in the near-term. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for that color, Gary. And my second question, I guess, you mentioned in your remarks that you have not gotten to a scenario where taking capacity out as profit accretive. I guess how much further would unit revenues have to fall in order for capacity reductions to make sense? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm sorry, I just \u2013 I can't do that math in my head. And again my answer with Mike Linenberg earlier was specific to the fourth quarter. So, we looked at some fourth quarter capacity changes that we could make and none of those looked productive to us. So, it will be \u2013 we'll spend our time better working on 2017. So, the hypothetical you're asking, I'm not \u2013 I can't readily answer, but clearly that's something that we want to look out here for 2017. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Gary, I realize I'm probably walking a thin line with the question, but I've heard you say a couple of times with regard to the fourth quarter at least that taking some capacity out, anyway that you sliced it wouldn't be profit accretive for Southwest. I mean I think if you look at what we've seen from some of the other carriers this quarter, most of the legacy carriers are trimming capacity. We can argue about what is the earliest you'd want to trim from the perspective of your customers, but those capacity cuts do likely help Southwest some way. And DOJ will, of course, complain about illegal price collusion or collusion of capacity levels, but there is also the opportunity, it seems, for some legal coordination, so to speak, on capacity levels and on pricing in the industry. And your comments suggest to me that you're perhaps resistive to playing that game. And I guess I just wonder, with Southwest having grown to be as large a player as it is in the industry today, isn't it kind of required that overall the industry is healthy in order for Southwest to be healthy?. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know what Darryl, I think I'm just not going to comment on your question. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I appreciate it, but I'm not going to comment. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Well, let me ask a simpler one then. Are you seeing any advantaged fares in the market today? And if so, what is your strategy for competing? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the advantaged fares are just a fare. It's a technique, it is a low fare. We predicted 15 years ago that all carriers were going to \u2013 have to become low fare carriers. It is a very competitive environment and carriers use a variety of techniques to offer low fares, that's from the lowest-cost carrier to the highest-cost carrier and that changes all the time. And we don't talk about our techniques and we are certainly not going to comment about our competitors' pricing techniques. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take a next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Just , Gary, well-worn question here on the call. But I'm just trying to understand something here, just from Southwest's perspective related to your comments that you were saying that if you're looking at industry capacity and then you were growing just as much as the larger players in the market that you were surprised but not disappointed. And what I was wondering is what you were hoping to see when you're growing supply like 3 times faster than GDP. So I'm just wondering what the expectation was? And just if this is just not \u2013 is this from a Southwest perspective, were you just adjusting to a new lower fuel price environment? Why you would be surprised if you're growing so much faster than GDP, and then Southwest isn't moderating capacity. I think most of your competitors showed moderating capacity into the end of the year, what the expectation was? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Savi, when we were having the same conversation three months ago, this was not the topic. So, we've got a change in trend. We'll need to evaluate that and see if we need to make some adjustments. I'll remind you that we had some secular opportunities to step up our growth in 2014, 2015. The added capacity that's coming online here this year is very modest, I believe, Bob, it's about 2%. So, you got the carryover effect of increasing the flying for the Wright Amendment, taking on the flying of the slots that we acquired for Reagan and LaGuardia. And then launching international service, which was a function of integrating AirTran and then what is true expansion, any way you look at it is launching international service as an example out of Houston Hobby. So, you have the full year carryover of that from the fourth quarter of last year. So we are, as we've said many times, we peaked in that capacity growth in 2015, we're coming down here in 2016 and now I think we're getting into a point where for 2017, we need to be thoughtful about how fast we grow. The other thing that's going on with our capacity is a fairly significant changing gauge. We're not adding a lot of trips. We're adding more seats than trips because of the up-gauging, and then we're getting a little bit more productivity per airplane per day because we're flying a little bit longer, so there's just less time sitting on the ground. So, all of those are adding up to more available seat miles than, I think, really tell the story about our growth, but I don't know \u2013 again as I've said, we're not shocked that this is where we are. We've been leading the industry consistently with unit revenue performances and I think has very much justified our growth. We've got record earnings and record returns on capital, so we have a little bit different economic and fare environment here that we're seeing in July, and again, we're going to react to that, and stay tuned. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And if I can follow up, Gary, then. As you talk about kind of looking into 2017 and kind of filling out your plans, is the opportunity to maybe shift more to international growth if domestic environment doesn't pick up here after September in that, because if I think about it, you're already retiring your Classic fleet. And if I remember correctly from your Investor Day, I don't think you have many retirements until 2023. So just what's the flexibility over the next few years to really kind of flex up or flex down capacity plans? Or is it just a mix between domestic and international? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, no, we have the absolute flexibility to flex up or down. And then we have tremendous flexibility to allocate capacity around the country or add or subtract international for that matter. As I think about the international, that's higher risk and truly expansionary, that's real growth. What are wonderful opportunities for us to add capacity remain in the domestic markets with our point-to-point system, either adding frequencies in markets that are spilling traffic or alternatively, connecting to cities with new non-stop service; that has much lower risk than adding a new Caribbean destination. And that is part of the reason that as we look at \u2013 just taking the fourth quarter as an example, why we don't see a profit positive move that close-in given that we already have this fixed capacity, you already have the employees, we've already got the airplanes, we've already got the corporate overhead, it's real hard to justify pulling in the capacity that close-in. So we're much better served to look a little bit farther out where we can impact the cost in more of a variable way and avoid the capacity increases that way. But we have plenty of opportunities to grow the airline. And whether we need to be growing at GDP or something faster or slower are all things that we're going to have to continue to judge, and I'm just not ready to give you an answer today. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts, Gary. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Gary, the impression that investors have is that your priorities at the moment might be somewhat out of order. The impression is that passengers come first, then labor unions, and then shareholders. And that's certainly fine when all is right with the world, and it certainly worked well under Herb. But during a time of industry crisis, and I would suggest that's what current revenue trends imply, most companies would consider revisiting their sort of priority order, at least in the short run. So my question, as awkward as it may sound, is this. Are you prepared to suspend all labor negotiations until we solve for the industry's revenue crisis? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. No. I appreciate the question, but the premise I would push back on. I think that certainly more than any other airline \u2013 and I'd put us in there with top-notch industrials, we have done a very fine job of trying to balance the needs of all of our constituents. And we've taken very good care of our shareholders. And it's interesting that you describe the current period as a time of crisis when in the first half of this year, I believe we've had all-time record shareholder returns \u2013 in six months. So, if that's a crisis, I'll take it. But the notion that we put one over the other is an unfair characterization. We must have good employees, we must take good care of the employees, we have a very intensive business and we truly care about people. We care about our people and then in turn we care about our customers. And it is a virtuous cycle, and to think that you can simply ignore that and say, we're only going to focus on the shareholders, doesn't work, it's not sustainable. But we're famous for telling everyone, and admitting, that's who we are and we're just not \u2013 we're not going to apologize for that. It's worked; this is the most successful airline in history, that is now turning out record earnings. And so we want to sustain that. We want to sustain the returns for our shareholders and the best way to do that is to continue to take very good care of our people. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Second question \u2013 and thank you for that, Gary. I knew it was a challenging and potentially differentiated line of questioning. Second question; you've got weak PRASM. As Tammy pointed out, you've got load factors at record highs. You've inflicted a pretty sizable fuel headwind on yourselves. And you're guiding to a year-on-year earnings decline. So why do you routinely ignore initiatives, industry initiatives intended to restore pricing stability? Or put differently, why does Southwest potentially choose to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution? Thanks in advance. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I am unclear as to how we are part of the problem. So, feel free to elaborate and I'll do my best to answer. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, I know you like to stay clear, understandably, of specific pricing questions. But sitting out the last Delta-led $2 to $5 one-way initiative, which at one point or another every other airline in the States participated in. I realize now I'm veering in Darryl's direction, and \u2013 but I mean, that sort of thing. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think you've arrived at his destination. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I will defer answering that question as well. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : What I would just roll up to though here, is rather than talking about any specific pricing or specific capacity questions that are really, as we all understand, off limits, our goal is to have positive unit revenues and we have seen that become \u2013 through the first half of the year we were doing a pretty good job there. The second half of the year now has emerged as more challenging for the reasons that we have articulated and I think it is incumbent upon us to figure out what we are going to do about that and we have all the tools that you are aware of. We have pricing, we have ancillary revenues, we have our capacity, and then of course new revenue initiatives, and we'll take a very close look at all of those and see what we can do to hit our goal. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think we had a decent \u2013 I don't think we have a reasonable prospect of having positive unit revenues in the third quarter. It probably is difficult to assume that for the fourth quarter. So that doesn't mean we won't make a hearty effort in that regard, but we'll certainly be looking very closely at that for 2017. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I do appreciate it, Gary. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes sir. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much. Gary, just, I guess pretty simply, if RASM is down again 3% to 4% in fourth quarter, is that bad enough for you to cut capacity next year? What's the threshold that you're kind of looking at? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think again, I know you all are pressing for specifics, we're just not prepared to give you that kind of a capacity outlook for 2017 or a bright line. I'm not happy with down unit revenues of 3% to 4%. And hopefully that tells you what you need to know. I'm interested to see if those trends continue and then we will take action accordingly. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then Tammy, what's the \u2013 just as we sit here today, what's the expected fuel hedge loss in 2017? Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The full loss, let me see if I have that handy. As I have the fair market value beyond third quarter, which I provided, which was $775 million, the net liability, you're asking for our total portfolio, which would be a net liability of $775 million beyond third quarter. Is that your question or are you asking for a break-down between... Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No. Just \u2013 I guess just for 2017, just how to think about how the loss is going to impact 2017. Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. For 2017 is about $550 million range. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Vice President and Chief Communications Officer : Good afternoon, Tom. Thank you very much. I'll go ahead and let you give instructions for folks to queue up and we'll go ahead and get into Q&A. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. And thank you for waiting. We will now begin with of first question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram: Hey, good afternoon, Gary. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the technology outage, the computer outage you had yesterday. And what sort of assurances do customers have that something like this won't happen again? It seemed pretty catastrophic yesterday. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That is a very fair question. I think we have hard work (62:25) to answer that because we do have significant redundancies build into our mission-critical systems and those redundancies did not work. I think we need to understand why and make sure that doesn't happen again. Every company has its challenges and things will break. We just need to make sure that they break and can be fixed in such a way that it doesn't have that kind of impact on the customer experience. So, we've got some work to do to restore confidence in our customers. We're obviously very passionate about serving our customers and determined to never have that happen again. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram: Can you say a little more specifically, like was this an equipment failure that then sort of cascaded through your different systems? Or was it just everything kind of went down? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Mike, you want to describe it? Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it was a router failure in our network. And the recovery mechanisms did not work as planned with that router. And it slowed the rest of the applications down to such an extent that they weren't usable. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And to my knowledge, we haven't had anything like this in our history. So, this is something that is unique for us. What we do understand is that the \u2013 some of our older legacy applications were the culprit, whereas a lot of the newer technology did recover as planned, but it's also integrated in networks that, again the whole system did not, it was not recovered and restored. Now eventually, it was, and there all of that was fixed through the course of 12 hours and over the course of 12 hours, multiple things were attempted to try to recover very quickly and ultimately they sort of went back to bedrock and rebooted everything, is probably a simplest way to describe it in layperson's terms. Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And I would also add that router failures are not uncommon. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, no. Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And so, but the severity and duration of this on our operations was, as Gary said, extremely unusual and we're trying to dig into that detail to understand that better. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram: All right. Thank you so much for the details. I appreciate it. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Well, shockingly it's about the same topic. And I think you covered a lot of the ground that I was going to ask about. But just again maybe if you can take one more try and being as specific as you can. What is Southwest doing, either things that were already in the works or new steps since the failure, since the outage, to prevent a recurrence? This is your second one now in less than a year. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's a fair question, David. I think this is \u2013 we're not even 24 hours into this. So, the first priority is to get the operation back up and running and serve the customers right now that need to get where they want to go. So that is our priority. Then to take a step back and understand why all the redundancy that we have invested in did not operate, that comes next. Mike, I don't know if you have any more information. Mike has been more involved with this as our Chief Operating Officer than I am, so. Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : So, David, we need to, as Gary was saying, we need to jump in and understand exactly what happened in this specific event. We will then have \u2013 add that learning to our recovery profiles with the intent, as mentioned earlier, with the intent of making sure that our recovery happens quicker and the issues don't expand quite like they did in this event. So, that's the first thing. The second thing that we're doing and have been doing is we are making significant investments in our technology, we've talked about, our Lone Star program, we've talked about our other operational investments, and all of those are going to bring our infrastructure and platforms up to a more up-to-date technologies. And that will allow us to recover faster than what we've been to do in this particular event. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay. I know it's early. Any chance you would speed up that investment timetable? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the investment timetable, I don't know. I think in terms of \u2013 I think the simplest way to describe this is, you can relate to power and a backup generator, where if the power goes down for whatever reason, you flip a switch and you've got a diesel generator that kicks in. So that conceptual backup did not work. And we need to understand better why that is, and we're just not prepared to do that yet. In terms of accelerating our investment, we're making significant investments in the technology already. And that \u2013 we've been talking about that, David, for some time, the need to do that. We have a legacy reservation system, as an example, and that is a major undertaking, and one that we're all looking forward to having that replaced next year. So, it will over the next three to five years, we'll have significant replacements of our legacy systems. I think we're already moving as fast as we can and in the meantime we'll just need to make sure that our business recovery processes are robust and will support the situation when another router breaks, because inevitably one will. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay. Thanks, very much. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Velotta with Las Vegas Review-Journal. Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Good morning, Gary. Do you have any estimates on how much the outage is going to cost you in terms of vouchers, overtime, equipment replacement, that type of thing? Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We do. I think it's a little bit premature, but we're having a very good day today in terms of our business, but obviously with the system being down yesterday, we couldn't take bookings. So, I think that we'll be able to recover much of that, but that \u2013 just that alone may cost us in the $5 million to $10 million range on a net basis, but we've got some work to do to recover bookings for the future that we would have gotten yesterday. So, Bob Jordan is here, I'll let him speak to this, but he is doing a couple of things to do more than just say we're sorry for our customers, and one of those is we're extending the fare sale that we had planned to end tomorrow, I believe. So, he is extending that a week. But Bob, do you want to talk about a couple of the things that we're doing? Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : Sure. As Mike talked about, priority one is obviously to get back up and operating and then right attached to that is to make sure we take care of our customers. So, everybody affected yesterday and it's going to continue today. So, all of our customers affected yesterday and today, we'll be contacting every one of them in some form here over the next couple of days and handling them. In addition, we just posted a full week extension of a major sale that we have going that was intended to end today. So, we're going to extend that for a full week to make sure everybody has access to those great fares, again that we're going to end \u2013 the sale was going to end today. So, \u2013 but again, priority one is to take care of our customers. So, everybody affected will be hearing from us. Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I just wanted to add on to that quickly, Rich, yes, we're worried about the financial impact of this, but what is far more important is the inconvenience that we caused our customers yesterday and today. And I feel very bad about that, we're very apologetic, and we want to just work hard to again restore their confidence in us. Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Thank you. Operator : And that is the final question we have today. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Vice President and Chief Communications Officer : Thanks for joining us. If you all have any other questions, you can reach us at www.swamedia.com, and we will route that to an on-duty spokesperson. Thanks so much. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review- Journal Operator : Welcome to the Southwest Airlines' Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call to discuss our third quarter 2016 performance. On the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please note, today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today, and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July, earnings per share were down from a year-ago levels by $0.01. We generated strong free cash flow of almost $400 million for the quarter, and returned $312 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. RASM performed exactly in line with our expectation, and again, that's taking into account the negative impact of 0.5 point that we had from the technology outage. We have consistently outperformed the domestic industry for 2015 and for the first part of 2016, along with the lapse of the year-over-year gains in our 2015 Chase deal; we've got harder comparisons in the near-term. Even with the outperformance, though, we've seen weakening sequential trends for a number of quarters now. But that feels like that's coming to an end, taken into account the timing of the holidays in September and November and December, January time period, the monthly and quarterly sequential trends look good to us, they look like they're stabilizing. I would quickly add it's a little too early to tell, if they are improving, although close-in bookings and yields are improved. As compared to some of the guidance that I've heard from our competitors, there seems to be a difference between the expectations surrounding the December-January holiday time period, but it's our guess at this point, consistent with what we saw calendar wise in 2011, that that might be as high as a point and a half. So you take that into account and again our trends between third quarter and fourth quarter look very comparable and maybe even better. A couple of very encouraging signs, first of all, the percent of new markets or developing markets are roughly at historic levels for us, down very significantly from where we were in 2014 and 2015. This will continue and perhaps fall further in 2017 as we slow our domestic growth to roughly 2%, and of course, this bodes well for our unit revenue outlook. The domestic industry is growing seat miles well ahead of GDP growth and we've seen significant competitive capacity adds in markets that we serve and it's increased competition that's diluting revenue on routes that we serve that accounts for the decline in unit revenue trends, and especially here in 2016. We're planning for rising cost in 2017 and that is due to higher jet fuel prices and labor rates. Our goal is to arrest the trend of declining unit revenues in 2017 and achieve positive unit revenue comparisons for the year as compared to 2016. We'll rely primarily on basic revenue management and route design techniques to achieve that and we're leaning heavily on our fleet modernization in the near-term to help mitigate our unit cost pressures. In the meantime and as we anticipated again in 2017 \u2013 for 2017, profits, cash flow, internal investments and shareholder returns are all strong. We achieved a 32.3% ROIC pre-tax for the 12 months ended September 30 and will be close to 30% for the year 2016. So, I anticipate another very strong showing in 2017, despite the competitive environment. Our priorities for the balance of this year and next year are unchanged. We'll start service to Cuba next month. We'll launch Mexico service from LAX under the new U.S., Mexico bilateral in December. We'll complete construction of a new five-gate international terminal in Fort Lauderdale in mid-2017 and then launch new international flights thereafter. We'll deploy the booking feature of our new reservation system in December, and begin flying those bookings in May of 2017, when we're fully deployed with our new reservation system. We'll launch the new Boeing 737 MAX next year and coincident with that retire our Boeing 737 Classic fleet. In addition to those initiatives, we'll also continue to focus on the basics, which are three, running a reliable operation, offering our customers exceptional hospitality and delivering superior profits and returns for our employees and our shareholders. So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo to take us through the quarter. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million, and excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline from third quarter last year's record results. Aside from our normal hedge accounting adjustments, special items this quarter included $356 million in expense related to proposed unit contract bonuses and $18 million charge related to the early termination of four of our Classic operating leases. As a result of the reduction in the outstanding shares from buyback activity, our earnings per share of $0.93 was down slightly by only 1% year-over-year, exceeding consensus by $0.05. The impact from our share repurchases is meaningful and since 2011, we've decreased our share count by 18%, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return value to our shareholders. Our third quarter EPS included about a $0.07 impact from our July technology outage. And without this impact, third quarter EPS excluding special items would've exceeded last year's record $0.94 with net income excluding special items comparable to last year's record $623 million. Of course we're delighted with our return on invested capital, which was an outstanding 32.3% ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, a very strong performance. And I'd like to commend all of our hardworking employees on another stellar quarter, especially with the challenging operational environment from the technology outage. We remain excited about the progress on our commercial and operational investment, including our new reservation system that we will begin selling reservations on in December followed by the transition to one reservation system planned for May of next year. And our outlook for fourth quarter supports another solid quarter to end a tremendous year of strong results. With that overview, I'll turn to revenues, which were a strong $5.1 billion. This was just $7 million shy of beating third quarter's last year's record, excluding the special revenue adjustment in third quarter last year. And if you exclude the $55 million unexpected reduction in our revenues from the technology outage, our third quarter passenger and operating revenues would've reached record levels. The 4.1% year-over-year decline in operating unit revenues was driven by record third quarter traffic at lower yields. We did see improvement in close-in trends during the quarter, however, the fare environment remained challenging, stable but soft is how I would characterize the yield environment in third quarter with average fares down over $7. Our freight revenues were impacted by a softer demand environment, but our other revenue improved year-over-year, driven by strong Rapid Rewards and other ancillary performance, especially EarlyBird and upgraded boarding products. Overall, given the industry fare environment, we are pleased with our relative operating revenue performance. Turning to our fourth quarter revenue outlook. While close-in trends have been encouraging, the industry yield environment remains competitive. And in addition, as other airlines have noted on their calls, fourth quarter comparisons will be challenged by the calendar placement of the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year. We estimate the calendar placement and compressed holiday travel the week prior to Christmas attributes an estimated 1.5 of RASM penalty. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to decline in the 4% to 5% range, whereas October currently running down about 5% including the impact of Hurricane Matthew. October is trending in line with what we saw in July and August, suggesting trends have stabilized. Based on the holiday shift, December is expected to have the most difficult year-over-year comparison. With respect to sequential third to fourth quarter trends, we're about 2 points off normal averages, which we attribute largely to the calendar placement of the holidays as well as the impact of the outage and to a lesser extent Hurricane Matthew. Looking past all the noise around the holiday shift, we are very pleased with early January bookings and wouldn't rule out starting the year with flat to possibly positive year-over-year unit revenue comparisons. We currently expect fourth quarter freight and other revenues to increase from fourth quarter last year as well. And moving now to our cost, our operating unit cost excluding special items decreased 2.4% year-over-year, largely from lower profit sharing and jet fuel prices. Our profit sharing for third quarter was $101 million compared with $177 million in third quarter last year. The lower profit sharing expense is due to the year-over-year increase in proposed union contract bonuses. Our economic jet fuel price per gallon declined a little over 8% year-over-year to $2.02 for the third quarter, which was driven by lower crude and heating oil prices. We expect fuel prices to be higher here in the fourth quarter. And based on market prices last Thursday and our current fourth quarter hedge position, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be close to $2.10. Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit cost came in up 2.6%, which is better than we expected. When you consider that almost 1.5 points of this year-over-year increase is from accelerated depreciation associated with our Classic fleet retirement and close to another point of the increase was driven by cost associated with the July technology outage, this was a very solid performance. Based on the current trends, we expect fourth quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to increase in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. About 3.5 points of this increase relates to the impact of the recent tentative agreements and our ongoing labor negotiations, and another point relates to accelerated depreciation of the Classics. For full year 2016, we expect a 2% to 3% increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing with the impact of the recent labor negotiations driving just over a point of the increase. The remaining 1% increase is right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year, driven by the acceleration of the Classic fleet retirement. And as always, we remain focused on controlling spend to protect our low cost structure and low-fare brand, which is even more essential with the increased labor cost pressure and a challenging revenue environment. We're making important investments in operational planning and recoverability tools for our employees to improve the customer experience as well as our efficiency. I have just a few comments on our liquidity and capital deployment. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion. We also have a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion, which was recently replaced and extended through August 2021 at a favorable term. Our estimated CapEx for this year remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft spend and approximately $700 million in non-aircraft capital spend. Our free cash flow of $392 million during the third quarter enabled us to return $312 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase executed in July. And year-to-date, we have returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of $1.5 billion of common stock and the payment of $222 million in dividends. Our leverage including off-balance sheet aircraft leases is in the low- to mid 30% range. I'll turn to the fleet and quickly walk you through that. We ended the quarter with 714 aircrafts in our fleet and our plan is to end the year with 723 aircrafts and that remains unchanged from what we last reported to you. We reached a meaningful milestone in our fleet during third quarter with the retirement of our last -500 aircraft. We have 95 Classic 737-300s remaining in our fleet that would be retired by the end of September of next year. During third quarter, we purchased four of our -300s off operating lease. The lease termination cost, it was recorded as an $18 million special item and essentially represents the cash payment for the equity buyout. We assumed ownership of the aircraft, thus adding the fair value of aircraft as well as the associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet as debt. We will continue to pay the underlying debt payments, but we now avoid the lease return condition cost exposure. And our estimated EBIT improvement of our accelerated Classic retirement remains in excess of $200 million as the prepayment of the rents were already contemplated in our original assumptions. As the economics of the equity buyout were clearly favorable, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to do similar transactions with the remaining 31 Classics under operating lease that have terms that extend beyond September 30 of next year. Our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. And as we announced last month, in light of the current revenue environment, we are slowing our capacity growth next year to less than 4%, likely 3.5%. Our domestic growth is estimated to account for approximately 2 points of that growth, with the remaining allocated to international. We'll begin the year with approximately 4% growth in first quarter 2017, bending down to flat to slightly up in fourth quarter 2017, due to the retirement of the Classic fleet by the end of the third quarter next year. In closing, we're pleased with our strong performance thus far this year. And based on our fourth quarter outlook, we're thrilled with the prospect of ending the year with an ROIC near 30%. And with that overview, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Break] (20:08-20:30) And we'll take our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for the time. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hi, Jack. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Just to clarify, I guess for my first question, just to clarify Tammy's comments there in her prepared remarks. With the comments around unit revenue \u2013 positive unit revenues in early 2017, was that simply for January or was that a 1Q comment? And then, can you quantify the impact from Hurricane Matthew to your fourth quarter RASM expectations? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. I'd be happy to do that. Yeah, the comment regarding getting back to flat and possibly a positive unit revenue was for early next year. I wouldn't rule that for January, but again it's early to know. As you know the majority of our bookings come in the month of travels, so we get about 50% of our bookings in the month of travel, but just based on what we're seeing in our booking trends so far for January, it looks really good. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you for that Tammy. And then so, when we think about the impact in 2017 from the recently-announced labor agreements, is there any way to sort of help us frame up the impact that you guys are expecting on a full year, next year? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. We shared that, for the fourth quarter it's about 3.5 points, so that's at least a reference point for you for next year. I don't think we will be too far off for that range on a year-over-year basis next year, but we will certainly firm up all that guidance for you on our next conference call. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks again for the time. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: And the \u2013 you had a question, sorry about that, of Hurricane Matthew, let me just give that to you really quick. For October, it was probably close to a point for the year-over-year October performance and be a little \u2013 it'll be less than that for the quarter in terms of RASM. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Tammy. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon everybody. So, Gary, based on the trajectory that you're on, it seems probable, not definite, but probable that Southwest will pay more than any airline for fuel next year, have significant ex-fuel cost pressures but you're certainly not alone, and potentially see the sharpest margin decline of any airline in the States and that's actually not the issue, I mean that's just kind of where the math is taking me. The question is when you ponder how the competition treats you, and I'm not suggesting that you become some 90-pound weakling, but isn't there some risk that if the industry perceives you as being in a weakened position, other airlines might start to turn on you? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, I think that if airlines perceive weakness, they clearly will act upon that and the report today is certainly not of weakness, it's of strength. We're looking forward to a really solid 2017 and we \u2013 as you well know, we have consistently outperformed the industry on the revenue front, not just the last 24 months, but over a longer period of time. Going back well into five or six years ago, so we have a lot of tailwinds that we're looking forward to. We have a much smaller percentage of our route system under development and that's after a very aggressive 2013, 2014 and 2015, which have resulted in stellar profits. So that should provide wonderful strength for us. It is appropriate for us to slow our growth and be measured in the expansion that we undertake here in the near term until our unit revenue turns positive. We are off of our revenue plan here in 2016 and it's largely a second half issue. As you recall, we had our analyst discussion back in June and then weeks later, we're seeing that the fare environment had changed for us pretty significantly. So, we have a lot of strengths, we have costs that are significantly below the vast majority of our competitors, certainly if you look at the number of seats that are out there, and we will continue to be strong and we'll continue to operate strong. A lot of the revenue declines year-over-year that we've seen after June 30, are \u2013 well, virtually all of them are in markets where we've seen competitive additions to those markets. So, we'll be mindful of that competitive growth, but you know that we're going to use our balance sheet, we're going to use our cost structure, we're going to use our employees with the service that we offer and we'll fight hard to maintain every single customer that we've fought hard to win. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Gary. I'll just leave it at one question this time. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Hey. Thanks. I wondered if you'd expand on that a little bit. Thinking about your relative cost structure versus other large airlines, in a period where there was a lot of restructuring around you that you didn't do and a lot of furloughing around you that you didn't do, how do you feel about your relative cost position today, looking out over the next five years versus the period that you have been in where large competitors restructured around you? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I would say that, if you look at recent history, say the last five years, maybe the last three to four years, compared to where I think we are, Duane, over the next five years, I think our competitive position is no worse and arguably at least relative to some competitors, I think it will be better. We've got work to do on our part and we've got opportunities to boost our efficiencies, our productivity, we'll need to continue to work with our labor leadership to find ways to improve our efficiencies and eliminate waste, but I think we're positioned very, very well there. The fleet modernization is the blunt tool that we'll use here in the near term and then as we deploy more and more new technologies over the next five years, we'll have better tools and techniques to drive efficiencies further, but I think we're very well positioned and that will continue to be the guiding principle for Southwest going forward which is to maintain our low cost position in the industry and improve upon it. And we're going to continue to work hard to achieve that. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks for that Gary. And then did you provide 2017 CASM-ex, I may have missed it? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, Duane, we did not provide that. We intend to provide that on our next call. We're still working through our plan; we're in the process of finalizing that. So, we'll certainly give you a full report the next time we talk. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Just a follow-up there, can you say how much of the accelerated depreciation is flowing through that fourth quarter guidance and when that would be expected to go away? Thanks for taking the questions. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: In the fourth quarter guidance that would be about one \u2013 it'd be about 1% of our CASM, the change in our CASM-ex. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : And do you know when that decapitates? Thanks for taking the questions? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. We'll \u2013 of course, we'll have our Classic fleet fully retired by September 30 of next year. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thank you. Gary or maybe even Bob, we often don't get a ton of data granularity from Southwest on RASM on these earnings calls, but can you give us some color around the nature of what's been driving the yield weakness, obviously you mentioned competitive capacity percentage in new markets, but what are the other things that we hear about like the impact of advantage fares or ULCCs or maybe even your own mix of connecting the local traffic. Can you maybe point out anything that's been sort of specific or maybe underappreciated at Southwest that you've identified as a RASM headwind that might be changing a little bit in the 4Q RASM forecast? Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, yeah, thanks, Hunter. And I do agree with you that we talk less about competitors and competitors' fares than our competitors do, so that's not going to change here today, but yeah, I mean the fare environment is very competitive and we have seen an increase in competitor seats in our markets that is fairly significant year-over-year, and so that obviously has an impact on us. In terms of how we \u2013 and of course the past four quarters through the second quarter of last year, we benefited from a very significant improvement with our Chase credit card deal, so that lapses. And that puts us in a position where I think until we find another way for us to differentiate our revenue production, we're going to kind of fall in with industry performance, which is where I see us here in the third quarter, that's where I see us in the fourth quarter, so I don't see that we are out of step at all. As to the mix of \u2013 within Southwest Airlines of connecting versus nonstop traffic, I'll let Bob speak to that. We provide some insights there, but it is clear that to your \u2013 if I think I understand where you're headed with your point that the fare environment will absolutely impact the mix of traffic that we realize on our network, so that will ebb and flow. Sometimes that's a positive effect in the short-term, sometimes it's a negative effect. There's nothing necessarily structural. We do have tools in place to manage that, we're looking forward to better tools with revenue management techniques, revenue management systems, new reservation system to manage that in the future. But, Bob, is there anything specific that you want to share here for the third and fourth quarter. Robert E. Jordan - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, I'm probably being redundant, but yeah we have seen a, as you would expect with some of the changes in the fare environment a shift from some connect at traffic to nonstop. We anticipated that and so through our revenue management systems we changed settings and things that you'd normally do to anticipate the shift in traffic there, but it's not a material change in terms of what we can \u2013 in terms of what we're managing or seeing. We saw it and we're managing it. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But I think, Hunter, we're a member of the industry, we're in a scenario where there are more seats being added than the GDP is growing in terms of driving just natural travel demand, and we're all seeing unit revenue pressure as a consequence of that. It's not shocking with fuel prices being down where they are and we're \u2013 our goal has been and will continue to be to, which we think is the right thing to do for Southwest, is to continue to target positive unit revenue performances in each and every period. We're not achieving that right now, that's not acceptable to us and we're going to continue to make adjustments until we do. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : So, as my follow-up then, you said you wanted to hit revenue positive last year and you didn't and you're still \u2013 I mean you're talking about seats above GDP, but you're doing it too. So I mean, if you're not tracking towards positive unit revenue as we move through the course of the year, even if your ROIC is above your cost of capital, would you cut capacity further? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, and again I have to push back a little bit. So, without retelling the entire story, if you go from 2013, 2014, 2015, and then there is some spill over into 2016, we had strategic opportunities that we took advantage of. It's something that you know well. Especially given the aggressive growth that we had in those periods, the revenue performance was exceptional. There're a lot of things that came online that we were confident that they would produce, they have produced and they've been sustainable. The industry growth has picked up in the last several years. So, yes, we'll need to contend with that. So, it is certainly correct to say that we're one of those that is currently growing faster than GDP and I'm mindful of that and hopefully have explained why that has been. And I think prospectively, we'll need to be more conservative with our growth and we're obviously committed to doing that in 2017. Tammy's already pointed out that we have an opportunity for positive unit revenue performance beginning in the first quarter. Some of the January strength that we're seeing, of course, admittedly is the holiday shift. But I think the main tailwind that I'm encouraged with is the fewer number of markets under development have sort of balanced against the number of markets that are now facing more competition, so on balance right now that's a negative number. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, Gary. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Just a follow-up on a couple of things. Just on the compressed holiday travel is the thinking based on what you were seeing in bookings, do you recover most of that 1 point, 1.5 point impact, and that the compression is not significant. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And also \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's recovered in January, yes. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Savi, I'll clarify that. Yeah. So, basically, if you look at the Christmas holiday, with that falling on a Sunday, there will be compression basically, I think, prior to that holiday. In other words, customers will wait to take that trip in between Christmas and New Years. So, we do expect some of that 1.5 point to shift into first quarter, but we believe some of that will be permanently lost, if you will. And if you actually go back to periods where the holiday timing fell at the same spot on the calendar, I think that's 2011 and 2005, our forecast lines up with what we saw back in 2005 and 2011. So, we don't expect all of that shift to move into July. I would expect them \u2013 actually that we might lose the majority of that, but we'll have to wait and see. It's so early to know at this point. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. And Tammy, maybe if I could just ask on that 3.5 point pressure in fourth quarter due to the contracts. Which contracts are in that? And are there any that's not \u2013 I'm just trying to think of as \u2013 if there is maybe a partial impact to the quarter or how should I think about that as maybe a run rate going forward? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Savi, I think, you should think of it as the \u2013 based on the status of all of our TAs that you're aware of. So, mainly, of course, that would be the pilots and our flight attendants. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Got it, great. And if I may squeeze just one quick enough for answer. Gary, you mentioned route design techniques in addition to kind of basic revenue management. Could you clarify that? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well. Sure. All we're talking about is just what frequencies we have deployed to city-pairs, what city-pairs we have out there. So, it's nothing magical about it. But those are the two levers, as you well know, and those are the levers that we will rely upon here to manage towards positive RASM. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question form Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the questions. Tammy, just had a question with regards to fuel. I think it's 63% hedged toward 2017 and this is pretty much well ahead of where you have been at this time of the year for each of the past two years from a hedge perspective. Can you give us a sense of kind of the range of prices that you may have locked in for fuel next year? Or just based on the current curve and current hedge book, what your 2017 hedge losses would be relative to 2016? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. I'd be happy to provide that. Yeah, as you noted, we're 63% hedged and we have gains that would kick in, if I remember correctly, just above 75 Brent, and the liability associated with our hedge book for 2015 (sic) [2017] is $525 million. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : $525 million. Thank you. And your hedge losses for 2016 were turning out $1 billion. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Our hedge losses for next year will be significant \u2013 based on the market will be significantly less next year. You are correct. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. And then second question just for Gary. I guess based on kind of what you're seeing in the RASM environment, is there anything that makes you question or have you seen any sort of structural change in the general health of the leisure traveler at all? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, not at all. I think this is all pretty predictable to, if the scenario is lower input cost and capacity is then secondly stepped up as a consequence because profits are strong, there are more seats fighting for the same number of passengers essentially and prices are going to soften. And that's exactly what's happening here. So, a couple of things need to happen, either demand needs to improve or supply needs to come in better alignment. But in the meantime, I just remind everybody that the profits are if they're not record levels, they're near record levels. So, I think what we will want to do at Southwest is to continue to manage in a way that does not assume that these good times are extrapolated into infinity. I think that would be an enormous mistake. So, the best discipline for us is to make sure that we keep revenues at a very healthy level and then therefore, for us that means that we want to continue to hang on to their unit revenue gains that we worked hard to achieve. But that's pretty much it in nutshell, that's what every other airline is seeing and what they'll do to manage is obviously their business, but that's what we're going to do at Southwest. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the time. Just on your comment of getting to positive RASM next year. Do you think your capacity guide that sort of 3.5%, 4% level is enough to get you there based on just demand trends today and competitive dynamics today? Or do you think you need a little bit of help from the latter things I just mentioned? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, I think that that is a good plan for 2017. Our plan is to have flat-to-slightly up unit revenue performance for the year. There're always things that are unpredictable in any given year, but that is the plan and that's based on our capacity set for next year. The one strategic thing that clearly we have underway that we want to follow through with is we're building this international terminal at Fort Lauderdale and that's strategic and it's committed and we will absolutely add to that. But back to Savi's earlier question, with our current performance, we're going to look very hard in our route network and make some decisions about what routes we might want to cut, what routes we might want to increase and it's just a normal part of our process that we go through for every schedule from that matter, but it will be with an increased intensity here, because we're not hitting our target. So, that's what you would expect us to do and that's what we expect ourselves. So, yeah, I'm comfortable with the 3.5%, 4% growth for next year and we'll continue to be thinking about what we do in 2018, based on how things progress in 2017. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Gary you're saying, you are assuming that the current demand environment, the current competitive dynamics sort of continue into next year or are you thinking that that's a help to get you there? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: It is based on our forecast of what competition is doing in 2017. So, all of us have a sense of what capacity is expected for 2017. So, yes, we're factoring all that in. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just follow-up. What is the reservation system upgrade come into play as far as being able to help you get there? Does that \u2013 or is that part of what you were just describing earlier in terms of router network adjustments? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, that's really \u2013 I'm not counting on anything from our new reservation system for 2017 in terms of moving the needle on improving our RASM performance. So, we're just going to rely on doing things the old fashion way for now, which again, I'm very proud of what our people have done over the course of time to get us to this point knowing full well we don't have all the tools and techniques that we would like to have or that we will have. But those aren't going to magically appear in 2017, that will come online and my expectation is that they'll come online gradually, in beginning in late 2017, early 2018. If we do better than that, I think that would all be fantastic, but I'm not counting on that. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Of course, always. Thank you, Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You bet. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure, Julie. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Tammy, I wanted to go back to your comments on flat-to-positive RASM potentially in the first quarter. What are the other factors that give you confidence on that trajectory given your low level of visibility with just a fraction of the bookings so far, your own capacity growth still above GDP, there is not a ton of relief on competitive capacity, the holiday shift might not fully be recaptured and Easter shifts back into Q2. So, just trying to understand what you guys are seeing at this stage that gives you the confidence to say that? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, Julie, that's just based on the bookings that we have for January relative to where we were last year. So, as you pointed out, that's not a \u2013 it's certainly not a forecast for all the reasons that you just noted, but at least the early signs for January are encouraging. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then can you just remind us, just on Easter shifting back into April, is that going to be \u2013 I think last year, you guys called it out the $15 million swing between the two quarters, is it similar this year? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. At this point, I wouldn't think that it would be materially different from that. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then what percentage of January do you have booked at this point? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't know... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: We have... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...but it is not much. I mean it's enough for us to get a read on the headline trends that we're describing to you. But, yeah, we've got a long way to go. We generally will start a month with about half the bookings in place. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. So... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. Tammy, I'd mentioned one other thing on the first quarter, which is our seat growth is less than 3% in the first quarter. So, our growth is absolutely beginning to slow. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's right. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): When will you guys give us an indication on the pace of growth in the second quarter? I noticed that recently on the website, you guys are going to release just maybe two more weeks, November 1, I think, typically you released more like four to six weeks of seat inventory, is that because you're re-thinking the pace of growth in the second quarter given the revenue environment? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Julie I can help. As it lines up to our full year guidance anyway, the less than 4% just kind of mathematically the way that would fall out quarter-to-quarter is that, second to third quarter would be in the 4% to 5% range. And then we bend down in the fourth quarter. And so that would be closer to flat when we get to the fourth quarter. So, that's kind of mathematically how all that would fall out. Now of course, domestic growth would be less than what I just provided. I call it a point or so. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: The schedule is \u2013 all we're doing now is preparing for the launch of the new reservation system and that's the only thing that has a bearing on what you see published. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, understood. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We don't have specific date to tell you yet, but other than we said, it's going to be in May. So just to be clear, the published schedule has nothing to do with any concern about the revenue. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. Julie Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay. Thank you so much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You bet. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Hey, Tammy, you called out a 100 basis point to 150 basis point hit to RASM in the fourth quarter from the calendar. But I was wondering, does that also include the discount travel vouchers that you had issued during the service disruption, the redemption of those that likely takes place in the fourth quarter? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, that did not include the travel vouchers. We would expect some impact from the travel vouchers, but we don't expect that to be significant. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess on... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: And just, if you're looking for a dollar figure there, it's going to be, say, under $10 million. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Thank you. And then with respect to 2017 unit cost, I think Duane had asked you about the accelerated depreciation, you said it carries through, but it doesn't actually grow next year, right, the accelerated depreciation is pretty constant from here? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's pretty constant, that's exactly right, as we move into next year. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hiring units along the way, so that'll \u2013 actually that will come down as will the fuel burn penalty that you get with the older airplanes and the extra maintenance burden, so it all sort of tapers off. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I guess are there any other big cost items that you would highlight for 2017 that we haven't talked about already today? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: We will have some costs associated with the implementation of our reservation system. As we ramp up for that, that will also taper off, but as Gary alluded to earlier, I think we're very well positioned next year. Yes, we do have cost pressures from our labor agreements, but we have opportunities, I think, throughout the company to really fine-tune and improve efficiencies and that's exactly what we're going to be focused on. And we are looking forward to giving you more of an update on our next conference call. But other than that, I wouldn't really call anything out. As we look into 2017 and 2018 too, our hope would be on the technology side as well, we could at least start bending that down in addition. So, now I'm \u2013 we are very focused on this and I'm confident that we'll be able to control our cost over the long run. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Tammy... Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Darryl, and I think this is probably somewhat related to Jamie's earlier question about cost, but there is a significant amount of spending this year and next year related to technology, investments and they are not necessarily all capitalized, a lot of that's just running straight through the expenses. So, they are all being done because we believe that there will be significant value that flows from them. And I agree with Tammy, I would hope that we can rein in some of our technology spending in the future, because for us it's quite high right now, but all very important things that we want to get accomplished. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Thanks, again. Operator : We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Gary, is getting to positive RASM next year is a goal of yours in the company then should it be a component of your short-term compensation? And as far as I can tell that 17% of your short-term comp is driven by total revenues, would you like to commit to replace that with a RASM metric? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I wish it was up to me, and I would do it differently, that's a joke. I don't know, I'll talk to the board about that. I've heard that feedback from investor relations that some of our investors are interested in that. We try to have a balanced approach. We don't want to incent the wrong behavior, and although, the officers that I work with and our directors are mostly focused \u2013 are all focused on just doing what's best for Southwest Airlines. Yeah. That's something that we'll look at, but no, I'm not going to commit, because I'm not in-charge. I'm not the Chairman of the comp committee and that will be up to the compensation committee. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, just at Lauderdale, could you just \u2013 I mean, are you guys prepared at this point to maybe share with us what your plans are? I think you have exclusive access to four of the five gates, what sort of utilization you guys expect to have there, initially? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We'll be releasing that in January, so stay tuned. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take your next question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. So, just one question here, I know the flight attendant results are due back on Monday, when is the pilot results due back? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I think, Mike, it's later next week. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, November 7. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: November 7. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: November 7. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: November 7. Perfect. And then, on the CASM guidance, the 4% to 5% that you gave us, is that inclusive of the salary increases that you also talked about or is that excluding the salaries? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That would be including them. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. That assumes those deals are in effect. Yes. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just one last follow-up, you talked about the tech outage earlier in the third quarter, so as you think about that IT spend, does that also include some amount of money to prevent an occurrence again where if something goes \u2013 I mean you can't obviously always prevent things, but if something goes wrong again, can you \u2013 can like your pilots wirelessly check in or can you go to a wireless system or somehow still manage to keep the airline running, while in the background you fix the issues? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Actually you're very insightful there. I mean we have a long list of opportunities to improve our tools and techniques, and of course we just didn't start this year, this has been a process, I've been with Southwest for 30 years and we've been continually investing in technology and evolving tools. Hardening or fortifying our technology is absolutely a component of our spending. Right now, we are in the midst of establishing a new data center, which in effect has a complete redundant data center at the same place in addition to a backup facility, is just one example. So, all those things are underway, and with the belief that \u2013 I mean just like a product, we want our airline to be better every year than it was the year before and we want our technology tools and capabilities also to fit that kind of a definition. I think I've mentioned to you all many times before, we've got two basic stacks of technology that we're working on, we've got the commercial side of things with the new reservation system as the marquee item, but there are a long list of sub projects under that that we've shared with you all, that are on the docket over the next several years. Likewise, Mike Van de Ven on the op side of things has a similar agenda and better automation and techniques \u2013 rather and tools and techniques and communication techniques are very much in the queue for work over the next several years with respect to our flight crews. So, the outage was really odd. I think I would readily admit to everybody that it is impossible to have a failsafe back over for every conceivable scenario that could happen, but it is \u2013 we're in really good shape and have a lot of experience in preventing outages like that. So, hopefully that addresses your question, but absolutely we want to continue to invest to fortify our technology. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, Gary, two quick ones here. Gary, you talk about the increased competition in your markets. Can you give us a sense about, maybe as a percent of ASMs, what you've seen coming over the last year? And just looking at the schedules, it does seem to be much more driven by ultra-low cost carriers rather than majors. Is that right? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. In other words, all things that you know that most of the high-growth airlines are the smaller low-cost airlines, although some of the legacy carriers are obviously growing in the grand scheme of things pretty aggressively as well, but, yeah, most of it is coming there. And then number two, Southwest is a big city, big traffic airline and that's where the passengers are. So we are clearly for the most \u2013 there's one exception with one airline who has a different strategy, but we're \u2013 in an environment like this, we at Southwest should fully expect more competition. We have expected it. We predicted it internally and in fact, it's happening. So, we need to compete and we need to compete by striving to have the best service at the lowest price. And that's what our strategy is oriented around. But we're not surprised that that is the case, Mike, but that is what you're asking is exactly what's happening. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Do you have a sense on maybe percentage of coverage? Is that something you have or maybe I can get it from you offline? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't have that readily in my mind. I'm looking at Tammy and Marcy to see if they have something they feel comfortable in sharing, but why don't you let us work on that because I do think that's a very reasonable question and is something that would help everyone understand better what is happening in the revenue environment. But in any event, we need to be very prepared for competition, we are. Our employees are warriors and we're going to fight very hard to not only keep the customers that we serve today, but we want to win more in the future. So, you do that with great service and low fares, period. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Gary, on just the \u2013 in terms of seats, I do have, that figure is roughly \u2013 it's probably roughly a 20% increase year-over-year for the third quarter and just a group, the ULCCs. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So, it's big. And again, I think hopefully that will help everyone to get a sense of why there is some impact on our unit revenue performance. That's a pretty big increase. And actually, as I look at our individual city-pair results, I'm very pleased with how well we are performing. So, we're not going anywhere. We're not going to back off in these markets. And obviously, we're very pro-competition and pro-consumer and very well prepared to compete in this environment. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. And if I then just squeeze in just one more on just ancillaries per passenger, every airline measures it differently. They throw in different items. When you guys think about that, like what's a rough number? And if you don't have it, you can always give it to me offline, but thanks for the questions. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, so, Mike, you're just talking about what's the right number to be targeting for us? Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, what is it currently? Are you $12 a passenger, $15 a passenger, how do you think about that? And just kind of get a baseline number there. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We've got the number. I just don't have it at my fingertips. We don't rank high in the way, I think, we would categorize ancillary. And I do think that we have some pretty significant opportunities to drive our ancillary business in the future. I would just quickly say that while we aren't hitting our revenue target in the bulls-eye right now, we are doing a lot. And so, I don't want our company to chase too many things simultaneously. We need to focus, we need to execute well, we have a very good strategy, we have a long history of performing exceptionally well and I'm very confident that we'll continue to execute well. However, there are a fair number of opportunities that we ultimately will want to pursue and we'll keep those relatively close to the vest until we're ready to reveal them. But I'm not talking about charging for bags, I'm not talking about change fees or some of those basics, but we do have opportunities to invest in tools and techniques, and perhaps beef up our own resources to be able to pursue some of these opportunities, and I think that that they would be meaningful. But driving growth in the ancillaries per passenger is absolutely an objective that we have. I don't know that we'll be doing a lot of that in 2017. It feels to me like it's more of a follow on after we get our new reservation system in. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. I agree, Gary. The only other thing I would add to that is, at least for the ancillary products that we do have, like our EarlyBird and our Business Select, EarlyBird for as an example, we're continuing to see very significant year-over-year growth in ancillary products such as that. Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Tammy. Thanks, Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Okay. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion for today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom, and welcome to the members of the media, who are on our call today. Before you start to queuing for questions, Tom, do you mind just giving them some instructions on how to do so? Operator : Yes, ma'am. [Break] (01:06:17-01:06:42) We'll now take our first question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail, kind of geographically, which markets you are seeing higher than average competition. Are there specific ones that you're feeling that pressure more? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Not really. Of course, knowing you're Dallas centric, ironic. The one that I don't mind sharing is Dallas and Dallas is very strong, of course we're the steady state over at Love Field at this point, but the Dallas is doing well and DFW is an airport with its traffic has grown a lot. Just thinking about the 48 states, there is a lot of competitive pressure in the west. You got airlines that are adding capacity in Seattle, in LA, I guess, Bob, in the bay area, so \u2013 but for the most part it's all over the country. So, there are about \u2013 the industry is growing at about a 5% clip in terms of seats and as you know the economy is growing, it's sub 2%. So that's what's happening, and it makes sense to the industry to do that because energy prices are so low, and we're leveraged to have energy prices. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Susan Carey with The Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Good morning. Hey, Tammy I think I missed your last comment about what I heard was a 20% increase in seats, this was from the discussion about what the ULCCs are doing. And I just \u2013 I'm thinking I can't have heard that right and which period and compared with what? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That was just for the third quarter, but we're seeing \u2013 that's year-over-year for the third quarter, but we're seeing, as Gary said, competition really across all of our markets by the entire industry, but certainly a lot of seats being added by the ULCCs, but that was the third quarter year-over-year comment. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So, I don't know the statistics, Susan, so I'm going to make sure that we clarify for you what it is. So, Tammy, you're saying if you took the ULCC seats in our markets that they grew their seats by 20%? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That is correct. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Wow. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. Their seats, now again, they're a lot smaller than we are, so it's not 20% of our seats, it's 20% of their seats. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Okay. Super. Thank you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: And just given \u2013 not to give too many numbers, but just to put an exclamation point on what Gary just said, that's in terms of just total seats for the industry that's probably close to probably, yes, 5%. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: And this is domestic seats? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That is correct. Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Thanks. Gary, is there any way you can put any detail on the ancillary opportunities that you'll look at? Are there \u2013 is there any way you can describe a couple of those for us? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, it's just not ready for prime time. And I'd rather not share with our competitors where we see opportunities for a variety of reasons. So, I will decline on that one, but thank you for the question. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Okay. Can I also ask, you filed with the DOT to extend the start date on your Fort Lauderdale Havana route to December 12, have you gotten a response from the DOT on that yet? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We have not. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Great. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: My pleasure. I'm very informed on that topic, Mary. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig - Associated Press : Hi. Well, Susan, actually asked my question, but insist Gary to clarify that. But maybe Tammy could \u2013 if it's a 20% increase in the third quarter and seats from the legacy up from the ULCCs, do you have a comparable figure from the legacy? And then more broadly for Gary, did you not expect this or was this to a greater extent than you'd ever seen before? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, no, I'll just speak for me personally. Yes, I have expected that if the industry profits recover, which they have and then we recovered more with lower fuel prices, it's just a natural extension of that is that individual companies are going to be more aggressive, and especially the smaller carriers. So, I think it's all very predictable. What the effect of that behavior is, is less predictable. So we had a plan for 2016, it's turned out to be more aggressive than our results and we go back and adjust. So, but no, I don't think it's shocking where we are at all, and we will continue to compete very aggressively in this environment, and I think we have all the strengths that we need, mainly the people of Southwest Airlines to compete and win customers, compete for and win customers. David Koenig - Associated Press : Okay, thanks. And was there a legacy figure on that Tammy? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: It would be in the 5% to 10% range, but just keep in mind, that's a very significant percentage of the seats in the industry. But if you're just looking at the network carriers, it'd be in the 5% to 10% range. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And if I could just, hopefully this helps clarify for everybody. We're the nation's leading airline, we're in all the major cities, we're in all the major city pairs. And so by definition, anybody who grows in the U.S., they will likely be growing in our market. So, I probably should have made that more common sense argument for the group earlier, but the competition isn't adding seats to small markets, in fact if anything, they're taking seats out of small markets. So, where they're going where traffic is and that is our specialty, because we are an airline that serves major markets with lots of traffic. So, I think it's very \u2013 it should be intuitive for everyone that whether it's a legacy carrier or whether it is a ULCC that they will likely be overlapping with us, when they add capacity. David Koenig - Associated Press : All right. Thank you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Just as a reminder, we carry one in four passengers here in the U.S. and our network is vast. So, I don't think there is really anything surprising, in the numbers that we've provided. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Right. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson, with The Arizona Republic Newspaper. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Good morning, Gary. I have a couple of questions. You mentioned in the beginning, the new booking feature of the reservation system will debut in December. What does that mean if anything for travelers? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't think it's going to really mean anything. I think that customers will mostly go to Southwest.com, that's where the super majority of our customers book Southwest and they will see the same Southwest.com as they know and love, it is behind Southwest.com, where we'll have a new reservation system engine. So, Bob, I think for the most part is going to be invisible to our customers. So, they won't know that they are making a booking in a new system, as far as I can recall. Robert E. Jordan - Southwest Airlines Co.: No. That's exactly right. The ease of use with Southwest.com will continue exactly like it is today and for customers booking there, they really won't see any change. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Will they see change come May? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'd have to think about that. I don't think there is anything that is customer experience wise that they'll see. So this is all back office things. Now, Bob has staffed up in our call centers significantly in anticipation of a new system that will take longer for our people to work with just because of a learning curve. So, we'll have all the resources we need, so that should be transparent to the customer as well. But other than that, I don't think the customer \u2013 even in that, I don't think the customers are going to see anything different. Robert E. Jordan - Southwest Airlines Co.: They won't. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: You mean stepping up, as in the approaches or right away like starting now in the rate (01:16:28) centers? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, he staffed up already, because they need... Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...to go through training and they need to know what it's like to talk to a customer and make a booking and work through changes and all those things before we add the new technology. So, all that is in place and I think Mike is going to \u2013 between Mike and Bob, they'll have trained about 20,000 employees with this new reservation system. One other thing real quick though, Dawn, since you're on this topic is remember that we launched international service in mid-2014 and that is using the technology that we are now converting the rest of our reservation system to. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So, we already have a lot of experience with this current technology and so I'm expecting that this is going to go very well. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. A couple more if I may, you gave the $55 million revenue impact from the outage? I don't recall a cost figure, is it on the cost side? Is there a figure for that? How many? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Four... Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: I'm sorry, you're cutting out? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: $24 million Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: $24 million? Okay. Got you. And last question, if I may, I think you already alluded to this when you were talking about ancillary, but in one of the analyst's reports this morning, it talks about given the weak RASM and the labor cost pressures, it's time for investors to turn up the volume on the need for things like bag fees. Do you have any comment on that beyond what you've already said? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, my hearing is good, and I understand, I think, my answer is consistent, which is, if we want to improve RASM, we don't want to charge bag fees, because that would only have a negative effect on our RASM. We have a unique and beloved position in the industry with this approach and we would be foolish to squander it, so no thought whatsoever on charging bags. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Thank you so much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Beyond what we already do, of course, which is modest. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question, we'll take our last question from Richard Velotta with Las Vegas Review-Journal. Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Good morning, Gary. I actually have a couple as well. One, could you give an update as to where Las Vegas stands in the queue for international service to Mexico \u2013 based off of what the new plans for LAX? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Rich, right now, there is none plan for 2017, so our (01:19:16) Las Vegas is, as you know, an extraordinarily important market for Southwest and one that we have just tremendous community relationships with. So, we will continue to keep it very high in our consideration set, but the focus for next year will be following up or following through with our Houston Hobby launch, we're obviously just getting started in Cuba and LAX to Mexico and then we'll be launching at Fort Lauderdale. So that's going to keep us really busy here for the near term. Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Okay. And then, the other would be, is it my understanding that Southwest does not have any objections to the northern most stadium \u2013 proposed stadium site. Pilots had indicated they were not in favor of the southern one that have Bali Hai golf course, but there is a northern one near Russell Road that I haven't heard specifically, whether there is any problem with that? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But, Rich, let me get back to you on that one. Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal: All right. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So I want to make sure I give you an accurate answer and that has not been my focus. (01:20:37) up-to-date information. Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Okay. Thank you. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Tom. As always, if our media folks have any follow-up questions, you can reach us at 214-792-4847 or via our media web portal at www.swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Marcy, and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our 2016 earnings call. First, I want to thank all of our Southwest employees for their very hard work and congratulate them on a superb year and one where we set a number of records along with $586 million in property sharing. So congratulations to all of our folks. Next, I want to welcome and acknowledge Tom Nealon, President of Southwest Airlines. Tom welcome. Tom Nealon : Thank you. Well, thank you. Thank you, Gary good morning everybody. Well, first of all, I am very excited to be Southwest. I am very excited about the new role. I have a lot of passion and a lot of energy for Southwest and for the people and the culture of Southwest Airlines, as you all know this is a very, very special place. We have tremendous momentum, we have a very clear purpose and we have a very clear vision. And I think we have a strategy that's going to help us achieve our vision overtime, and I see my role is driving the execution and the implementation of our strategy. I'm going to do it with Gary, I'll do it with Mike and with the entire team here at Southwest. So I'm very optimistic about our future and we are moving forward. Gary Kelly : Well, congratulations again Tom on your new role and we're very excited to have Tom in this executive leadership role. And likewise, I want to welcome and acknowledge Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer. Mike, welcome. Mike Van de Ven : Thanks, Gary. I also am really energized about my expanded role and \u2013 and I agree with Tom, we've got a lot of momentum; I really believe that our best days are ahead of us and I look forward to working with Tom and Gary and really the rest of our team just to make that belief a reality. I do know a lot of you all already, I look forward to working with you guys a little bit closer \u2013 more closely in the future. So, thanks Gary. Gary Kelly : Well, congratulations to you as well, Mike. And all three of us are very excited to be working more closely together. Well, obviously we're very pleased to report another record year, record year of earnings, record year of earnings per share. This is our 44th consecutive year of profits which of course is unprecedented in the airline industry but I'm not sure how many others in corporate America can say that they've been profitable for that many years ago, so my guess is not many. But it certainly allowed us to take great care of our people, great care of our customers, great care of our shareholders for over five decades, and as you can imagine we're very proud of that. We're very pleased to in 2016 and begin this year on a strong note. Our average fourth quarter '16 fares were down year-over-year $5.51. Unit revenues were down 2.9% but after two years of sequential declines it feels like we're bottoming plus we've outperformed the industry since 2014. We have a shot at flat unit revenues year-over-year here in the first quarter although our current forecast is somewhat below that. But that's our goal and we will work hard to hit that first quarter goal. But regardless we're seeing a strength sequentially from fourth quarter to first quarter, and that of course is a welcome change. We've already announced that we've slowed our growth year-over-year in 2017. Consistent with that even though we're growing international at a pretty significant rate, it's on a very small base; so the majority of our growth will be domestic. Another thing to note is that the percentage of developing markets has dropped below 4%, and obviously that's providing us some strength going forward as well. And really that's the big news for this quarter that business has strengthened, otherwise our report is pretty much an update, our 2017 plans have been set for quite some time, the vast majority of the work surrounding our initiatives for this year is complete. So we'll be finishing up and deploying our new reservation system, our new international terminal in Fort Lauderdale, the new Boeing 737-8 aircraft. As planned along with that we will be grounding and retiring the remaining classic fleet in the third quarter of this year, we will launch international flights out of Fort Lauderdale in June, and at that time we'll open up one new destination which is Grand Cayman. And in terms of route news for this year we'll also consolidate our northeastern Ohio operations into Cleveland, and we will consolidate our southwest Ohio operations into Cincinnati. And Cincinnati will be our second new city for this year. These airports are very close to Dayton and Akron Canton which will give us the opportunity to continue serving our customers in those cities along with winning more customers. So I'm very excited about our plans for 2017, I'm delighted that our trends have strengthened. Given that the current economic outlook is pretty good as well as the current outlook for moderate energy prices, we're hoping for another great year in 2017. Balance sheet is strong, our liquidity is very strong, our CapEx plans are very manageable and our goal is to continue rewarding our shareholders. So Tammy, with that very quick overview I'll turn it over to you to take us through the quarter. Tammy Romo : Thanks, Gary and I'm excited too. Welcome everyone. We are very pleased with the record profits we've reported this morning for 2016. Our earnings were a record $2.2 billion with operating income of $3.8 billion, excluding special items our 2016 net income was a record $2.4 billion with record operating income that produced a very healthy 19.4% margin. These results generated cash flows also at record levels enabling us to deliver on our commitment to invest in our employees, our customers and our shareholders. We had a return-on-invested capital of 30% which is just an outstanding accomplishment for the year. Before I jump into fourth quarter results, I'd also like to congratulate our employees on our 44th consecutive year of profitability and their 42nd consecutive year profit sharing which was $586 million for 2016. As you can see from our report this morning we ended the year with a solid fourth quarter performance. Our fourth quarter revenues were a record $5.1 billion and unit revenues declined 2.9% which was better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Travel demands and close in yield pick-up following the election and that carried through to the end of the year. Business travel leading to the December holiday was also better than we have expected early in the quarter. The strength in demand resulted in a record fourth quarter load factor performance of 84.4% and thus far the fair environment has held here in January. Based on these trends in current bookings, we are forecasting flat to down 1% RASM year-over-year as Gary took you through here in the first quarter. Considering our outperformance of the industry since 2014 and our 4% ASM growth in the first quarter, we encourage by the sequential improvement in our year-over-year RASM terms. We also expect strength in other revenues and continue into the first quarter of 2017. Turning to our cost performance; it was in line, right in line with our expectations. Unit costs excluding special items increased 2.9% year-over-year, largely driven by higher labor costs and union contracts ratified during 2016, as well as the accelerated depreciation associated with the retirement of our classical fleet. Our economic jet fuel price per gallon increased 2% year-over-year to $2.07 for the fourth quarter which was driven by higher crude and heating oil prices. Based on market prices in last Friday and our current quarter \u2013 current first quarter hedged positions, we expect our first quarter field price per gallon to decline from fourth quarter to the $1.95 to $2 per gallon range. And this estimate includes a hedging loss in the $0.25 to $0.30 range. And for the full year of 2017, we currently estimate a fuel price per gallon in the $2 to $2.05 range based on market including roughly $0.20 to $0.25 in fuel hedging losses for each quarter beyond first. So just a few comments on our non-fuel costs excluding fuel specialized items and profit sharing, our fourth quarter unit cost increased 4.4% year-over-year which was in line with our guidance, roughly 3.5 points of this increase was attributable to our new union agreements which included an immediate snap-up in wages for our flight attendants and pilots during the fourth quarter. An additional point was attributable to accelerated depreciation resulting from the retirement of our classic fleet. As for our 2017 cost outlook, we anticipate year-over-year cost inflation to peak here in the first quarter due to the timing of labor rate increases largely. And with this in mind, our first quarter CASM excluding feel special items and profit sharing is estimated to increase in the 6% to 7% range year-over-year. With about four points to this increase related to labor contract. By the fourth quarter of this year we expect our unit costs excluding special items and profit sharing to trail to roughly flat year-over-year. This brings full year 2017 unit cost excluding field special items and profit sharing to an estimated increase of approximately 3% year-over-year, almost entirely driven by wage rate inflations. Beyond 2017 we anticipate wage rate increases closer to inflationary like levels in accordance with the ratified agreements. As ever we remain focused on controlling spends through our operational investments and ongoing fleet modernization. Turning to our balance sheet; it remains as strong as ever with $3.3 billion in cash in short-term investments at year end. Our leverage including off balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low to mid 30% range and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment grade credit rating by all three credit agencies. During fourth quarter, we repaid $352 million in debt and capital lease obligations and retire the $110 million in convertible debt at maturity. As expected, the majority of bond holders converted their bonds to share of stock resulting in our remittance of approximately $68 million in cash and $6 million in shares. During fourth quarter we entered into a $215 million secured term loan and we issued $300 million in unsecured notes at our record 10-year low on coupon rate of 3%. In regards to our 2016 capital expenditures, we ended the year with $2 billion in CapEx as expected with technology and facilities spend as the most significant drivers outside of the $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx. Our estimated CapEx for 2017 is approximately $2.3 billion with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft. With record earnings and sustained balance sheets, our operating and free cash flows reached record levels, enabling us to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During fourth quarter we completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase launched in third quarter and we launched a new one which we currently expect to complete in February. We have $950 million remaining under our $2 billion authorization, and since 2011 we have decreased our share count by more than 18% through over $5 billion of share buybacks and our Board of Directors declared our 161st consecutive dividend during fourth quarter. We have a decade long history of upholding our commitment to return value back to our shareholders which is a designation not only we can claim in the U.S. airline industry. I'll give you a quick recap on fleet; we ended the year with 723 aircrafts in our fleet as planned. Based on our current firm orders for delivery and 87 Classics will retire by the end of September. We intend to in this year just over \u2013 with just over 700 aircrafts in our fleet and then grow our fleet to around 743 aircraft by the end of 2018. We believe this level of fleet growth will allow us to continue to optimize and prudently expand our already robust network. The 5.7% increase in capacity during 2016 was predominantly in our domestic markets including our new city of Long Beach. We continue to manage 2017 capacity growth of approximately 3.5% with domestic growth accounting for roughly 2.5 points of that growth. Domestic capacity growth has moderated from 2016 levels from the highs of 5% to 6% to levels more in line with GDP and we are \u2013 I just wanted to point out our LTCs are growing in the low to mid-teens through the first half of 2017 but as this is said, just keep in mind that it's small part of the base. So just in closing, I \u2013 we just wanted to thank our employees again for just a tremendous quarter and tremendous and I just can't thank them enough for their outstanding customer service. So with that overview, I'll turn it over to you Tom and we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Great, thanks guys, appreciate the time. Gary in your opening remarks there I thought you said you're currently running \u2013 and correct me if I misheard you; but I think you said you're currently running below your [indiscernible] and you hope to get there by the end of the quarter. Did I hear that? Gary Kelly : Yes, if we were to give you a point forecast today it would fall within that range of down one to flat. So right now flats at the top of the range. So really just repeating the obvious but our goal is to get to flat resin and we'll see if we can do it. But the reason \u2013 and then I think \u2013 you know, I think the important point though is what is \u2013 we're very comfortable in saying today as if the trends have improved and that sequentially they've also improved just in the short period of time for third \u2013 from fourth quarter to first quarter, so obviously that's a very welcome change. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And I guess would you characterize your guidance for the quarter as more or less a good run rate to use or are there items in there, related to the holiday shift? You know, first of all, is there any further may have impacted January and March within your guidance that maybe we should be aware of? Gary Kelly : You're just talking about beyond the first quarter? Darryl Genovesi : Yes. Within your guidance for flat to down 1%. I suspect there's probably some headwind in March and I guess there was \u2013 from the ladies and I was hoping that you could break that out. And then similarly, on the \u2013 you want to move [indiscernible] that I think some carriers have characterized likely to benefit January to some extent. Gary Kelly : Yes. I will let Tammy do that, but the answer, I think to your question is it's not a straight line. So yes, there's a lot of choppiness in the quarter that are just trying to see our way through all the incomparabilities with periods. You have a holiday benefit, you have a holiday bogey and I'm thinking out loud, Tammy, I think there are some other things that are a little bit peculiar with the calendar change in January moving two days from the leap year also. You don't have the same number of strong days. Tuesday doesn't equal a Sunday, I'm sure you know. But what other color or solitary would you like to offer there? Tammy Romo : Yes, I'll be happy to jump in there. We begin January with positive year-over-year routes and trends due to the holiday return travel as Gary was noting there for January. You have a little bit when you actually line up the calendar days, there's less pig days, if you will, in January this year versus last year. But yes, January here is starting off very solid comparing just walking to the quarter. February should have cleanest or easiest comparisons of the quarter with March being impacted by the Easter shift into April. So those are the things you probably want to focus on as you're trending for the quarter, but our outlook at this juncture is solid. Darryl Genovesi : Great, thank you. If I could just ask Mike if you had any particular objectives that you would highlight with your expander responsibility that you think you might be more focused on or the company might be more focused on than the future than they have in the past? If you'd take a shot of that and appreciate it. Tom Nealon : I think about our priorities. I break it into two categories or two buckets if you will and Gary really hit on the first one which is \u2013 and we have work to do, to I get the classics retiring, get the Max in, we have work to do to get the new reservation system in and that's all going great. Things like that, the work is in progress now is a category of priorities. From my perspective, the second category is very much focused on bringing our strategy and our vision to life. There's a lot of work going on there. I think about our vision statement which you all know, it's very clearly a statement of our intent. We intend to do this. We know it's going to take time, we're okay with that, the business is very strong. As I said earlier, we have a lot of momentum, I feel very good about that and I think we have time to execute the strategy in a very structured thoughtful way and there are all sorts of things that might kind of work together. Let me just give you an example or two of some of the things and I'll see if I can disclose the strategy, but I'll give you a few examples of things. Very clearly, we could do a better job of enabling our front line employees with the tools and information that they need to do their job. That's a big deal in terms of driving efficiency, it's a big deal in terms of improving their customer experience and to be honest with you, it's a pretty big deal in terms of improving the quality of life of our employees, so we are very focused on that so there's work to do there. I think when we think about our customer experience, you will get tremendous praise and great feedback from our customers on our customer experience, but there are areas there that we can do better at. Just a few examples, I guess one I'd call out is we have a very strong mobile customer experience today which is a big deal for customers. 10 years ago, five years ago, not so much. Today, it's a very big deal. I think ours is good, I think ours is solid, but there's a lot of enrichment, and a lot of function, and a lot of stepping you bring to that. That's an example. One of the things that Mike and I \u2013 I've hit Mike on his shoulder here, one of the things that Mike and I are working on together is to continue to build out the operational capabilities and we're driving for obviously reliability. We're driving obviously for efficiency. But the other thing we need to be building for is scale; we need to make sure that the operating processes that we're putting in places scale as we grow and that's a big deal for us. So that's some of the things that I'm focusing on personally. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. I think that you will just hear Tom and I be really ride on top of one another in terms of what we think that our priorities are and maybe just saying that a little bit different than Tom did. But for me, my first priority really is our people. We've done a lot as Tom mentioned and Gary has talked about over the last several years expanding our company's capabilities and a lot of those changes are driving needs to change some of our older processes. Focusing on us, having efficient and coordinated process, as better tools for our people where they can have information that you need at your fingertips, having better decision support tools to help our customers and empowering them \u2013 that is probably the number one priority that I have. And then two and three below that, Tom mentioned, we have an operating infrastructure that we want to build the capabilities on. Our network is really complex and we've got a lot of opportunities, I think to improve our operation and reliability and our responsiveness in situations if we can make these kinds of investments. We've got a pretty critical focus areas, probably in the maintenance system, that cruise scheduling applications or flight management systems and decision support tools. And then lastly, really focusing on the cost. I think that we do a really good job with service and I think as our company is growing and we got more challenges in the industry on the cost front is to be focused on what we can do as a team and execute better to be more competitive on the cost side of the business. Darryl Genovesi : Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate your view. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hi. I don't want to de-track from the results of the quarter and the outlook, but I do want to come back for the domestic capacity guidance increase. Your earnings release in October said you're going to go 2.0% and now you're saying 2.5%. I think and this is my personal thing. I think we're willing to hear from you that this is not going to turn into a repeat from what happened in 2015 with small increase after small increase. I don't think anybody has an issue with Southwest going 2.5% domestically, but I think we need to hear early signs. To hear this is not going to go back to 3% and then 3.5% by the time the year ends because if that dynamic repeats itself, I think it's to be no surprise to anybody if this stock fails to work. Gary Kelly : Tammy, you want to address that? Tammy Romo : Yes. Just to summarize your question, Hunter, just discussing why our domestic went from 2% to 2.5% points. Really we just firmed up our capacity allocation and when it was all said and done, it was weighted heavier to domestic and that's really just the function of the additional seasonal international adjustments that we make and really just working through the logistics of our classic fleets. So it was just really firming up our capacity for the year. Gary Kelly : Hunter, my answer is real straightforward. We were not changing our fleet plan, we've already committed to growing the system 3.5%, nothing has changed in our network plans for 2017 from October. I guess when we get down to the last half a point, things rounded differently, I don't really know. The only thing that we affirmed up since October is we committed to open Grand Cayman, which we have announced and that capacity was already a component of our flying out of Fort Lauderdale. In addition to that, we decided to consolidate in Cleveland and open and consolidate in Cincinnati and that is pretty much a neutral change in capacity. So we're simply moving capacity from one allocation to the other. Beyond those very basic things, I cannot recall any change at all that we have in our approach to scheduling capacity for 2017 and I think importantly, when we look at the levers that we have to drive, given a fixed amount of airplanes which those ins and outs also have not changed to my recollection. The only other level that we have left is to either increase or decrease the daily utilization and that also is unchanged. Other than just reporting the component of domestic versus international, I was a little surprised this morning to the reaction to that, I will admit. But in any event, I think my answer is nothing has changed. Hunter Keay : That's good, Gary. I appreciate that and just getting a little bit deja vu with the 'rounding' because that was a word that you guys used a lot, again in 2015 as well. It was rounding as well as anybody. The sensitivity around this type, given your market share and your cost structure, you guys have the potential to be very, very disruptive. So I guess my follow-up question would be \u2013 and thank you for that color \u2013 are you prepared to use the word 'cap' in the context of domestic capacity growth to 2.5% with the realization obviously that the system is still going to be unchanged at 3.5%? Gary Kelly : No, I'm not. But I think what I am saying is that there has been no change. There is no change that I am considering at this time. Something would have to happen for us to change, but no, I would never make a commitment like that because you just never know, something could happen. But there is no effort under way to bring in more airplanes \u2013 even if we wanted to bring in more airplanes. I doubt that that would even be physically possible knowing what we know with the market. We are already published through June \u2013 August, I beg your pardon, we have a June 4 schedule, it takes us through August. So the only thing left to tinker with would be the last four months of the year. Hopefully I've answered your question. But I do want to be clear that we're talking about 3.5% in growth and that in system ASMs and the split of that is 2.5% and 1%. But if you look at the domestic growth, if you just look at the increase in domestic compared to the domestic system, that's different arithmetic. This is the mix of the 3.5%, it's 2.5% and 1%. But international is growing 30% somewhat if you're comparing it to the small international base and then likewise the domestic increase compared to the domestic base is something like 3%. But I think the numbers that you all are referencing back to is the split of the 3.5%. So 2.5% versus 1% point. Hunter Keay : Okay. Yes, you answered the question. Thank you, Gary. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company Helane Becker : Thanks, Operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the time. I just have a couple of questions. One, on the international, is it possible for you to break out revenue or actual ASMs as opposed to just reporting them in one group? Tammy Romo : Hi, Helane. How are you doing? It's possible, but yes, we haven't provided that level of detail. The international is about 3% of our network. We've been pleased with the development. Just to give you a little bit color, we've been pleased with the development of those markets and if you just look at the international market as an entity, we are seeing a positive year-over-year unit revenue growth if you just look at the international markets. But again, it's a small, small percentage of the total system. Helane Becker : Is there a point in where you get big enough where that has to be broken out? Even if just in your annual report? Gary Kelly : Yes. Absolutely. That's more [indiscernible] absolutely. Tammy Romo : At a point, yes. So we're just not yet there, Helane. Helane Becker : Okay. And then my other question is unrelated to that. It's on maintenance cost of clients in the fourth quarter. Did something happen there in the fourth quarter that cost it to be down too much, or is that the accelerated retirement of the classics? And should we expect that 11% decline for the rest of this year? Tammy Romo : You've got it, Helane. We are seeing a favorable impact of the retirement of the classes and you'll see that continue into 2017 as we go to the year here. So you've got it exactly right. Helane Becker : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Gary Kelly : You bet. Jack Atkins : Gary, I guess the first one for you \u2013 and it's a regulatory front \u2013 could you just sort of speak to what you're hearing out of Washington with regard any potential changes, stands or positions from a new administration relating either your business of the industry overall. Obviously we're all aware of potential tax policy changes which will benefit you, guys. But just sort of curious to get your thoughts on what we might see in terms of regulatory changes over the next few years and if that's a positive for your business or not. Gary Kelly : Well, I think we're hoping for some positives here. There is three teams that were very enthused about. You have the tax reform, you mentioned the regulatory reform and then thirdly infrastructure investments which I will admit were a little bit weary of is to how that might either helped or head us, but clearly our primary objective is to modernize the air traffic control system which falls in infrastructure and could have a huge benefit for aviation and for the traveling public. But to answer your question, we probably know more than you do, but at this point, it is fair to say, is very early. I have not met with Elaine Chao [ph] yet and we're very enthused about her nomination, we're very enthused about working with her, but it's just very premature. I don't know that it's clear exactly what the administration's focus will be in aviation. I think there's broad desire to roll back regulations, but I don't know that we know of anything that is specific. If I had to spend more time in Washington here in the first quarter and hopefully by April may have a bit better read on that, but we've looked at which is a broader corporate issue, we've looked at the tax reform proposals and we're quite excited about that on the corporate front. But that's just on income tax. So then as I really speak to the very heavy burden that we have for aviation taxes which we also want to take up with the administration. So that's a long answer to your question and I think the bottom line is no, we don't know anything specific yet, but we sure like what we're hearing so far. Jack Atkins : Well, that's very helpful insight though, Gary. Thank you. And then for my follow-up question, just a housekeeping for Tammy. The $109 million hedge asset for 2018-2019 that you referenced in the press release, could you maybe break that down in terms of what's tied to 2018 specifically? Tammy Romo : Yes. For 2018, it's going to represent about $91 million of that of the $109 million that we reported in the press release. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. Thank you again for the time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savanthi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi Syth : Hey, good morning, or good afternoon, actually. Tammy, just a follow-up on an earlier question, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what the holiday drags that we should \u2013 if you can quantify a little bit more the holiday's benefit to January and maybe the drags till March? Tammy Romo : Sure, Savi. I'd be happy to give you a little more color there. As we've said earlier, the holiday impact was better than we expected due to the improvement in the yields and stronger business travel. The holiday shift ended up impacting fourth quarter rather than the but about $0.5 no maximum, while was then what \u2013 we're about a half point which was better than what we were originally estimating, which was that 1.5 point, and we estimate the January benefit as probably in the $20 million range. In just you\u2019re thinking about the quarter. Again just to remind you we've got the Easter impact to March, that will shift. So hopefully that provides you a little bit of color, but. Savanthi Syth : Any thoughts on the Easter one on that timing. Tammy Romo : Yes, the Easter impact was about, it's probably in the same range the $20 million range as well. Savanthi Syth : Right. And Gary, if I might just go on the capacity question a little bit. We've had \u2013 you've had a low fuel and here we have classic retirement, so there's been a lot of capacity growth maybe hasn't been quarter-on-quarter normalized range and you look out I was just kind of curious how you think about that and what that level of might be. I know the fleet order looks like maybe 6% fleet growth in 2018 just your thought around that and if I may also on the mac delivery, your comfort level on the timing of the delivery and if there is any contingency plans if there are any delays around the delivery in 4Q. Gary Kelly : I think \u2013 I think you characterize the last couple years well, to go back over a little bit longer period of time at least starting in 2012, 2012, 2013 and 2014 we had very, very modest if any capacity growth. So with the opening up of our field we were preparing for more aggressive growth in 2015, as a follow on to that along with opening of the Houston International Terminal, and then the third major route theme in that time period was the acquisition of slots from American at primarily at Reagan. So we were comfortable with above \u2013 with more aggressive growth in that time period because we thought those were unique opportunities and we thought they would be very profitable, and all of that proved to be true. So the 2016 experience was a follow on to that build up in 2015. And now we get into 2017 which is choppy as you mentioned because of the accelerated retirement and the grounding of the classics. So that will make for some choppiness, but so I think in relation to that 2018 will probably be a little choppy as well. Trying to give capacity guidance beyond what we have published, I think it is very speculative, we want to grow at a rate that will produce positive unit revenues, that is our goal. And trying to tie that to a number or to GDP or anything else is somewhat non-sensical. But in any event I think we're on the record as saying that we intend that our future growth would be no more than what we've had here in 2016. Which is pretty ambitious growth, so I see it being low single digits, that's just kind of put my thumb in the air, but right now we have plans which are very flexible which will allow us some rounding up or down. And we of course after this year we won't have many retirements for several years, and we'll be able to really dramatically reduce our capital spending after 2018 also but hopefully that's responsive to your question, but we're not wedded here to any one growth number, much less willing to commit one way or the other what it would be in the future. I think that would be a mistake, but that hopefully should give you some kind of ideas to the way we're thinking about it. Savanthi Syth : That\u2019s helpful. Gary Kelly : The MAX side, we're really, really good and Mike, would you like to speak to that. Mike Van de Ven : Yes, as you know we're going to plan to put that in revenue service after we retire the classics and that will be at the end of the third quarter and from all discussions we've had with Boeing that airplane is performing magnificently. It is on schedule and we expect to be able to execute exactly as we have planned. Savanthi Syth : And I think you guys are doing already, right in increase your comfort level that there. Mike Van de Ven : Yes, yes we've already done the service ready operational validation we had the airplane down at Dallas we fall and we've flown in and with and tested it with our system late last year and all \u2013 all those tested it just performed exceptionally well. Gary Kelly : In addition to the airplane, obviously Boeing and GE need to do their parts but we then we have to be trained. So that's the other moving \u2013 moving piece of this and we believe we've got a full handle on that and have all the training capacity in place along with the hiring that Mike is going to need to support all that as well. So I think everything is lined up very, very well. And as I mentioned in my introductory room remarks there we have three major things for this year. And I don't know if putting a percentage to it is so literal but my thought is that 90% of the work for the new reservation system for the launch of international out of Fort Lauderdale or for the MAC is done. So we're now down to that last 10% and the deployment phase and I think we're all feeling very, very good about all three of those. Savanthi Syth : Got it, very helpful, thanks guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Good afternoon all, thanks for taking my question. And Gary, I know them so my question is can sound a little arrogant, but you keep in mind we don't run money, we don't run companies so that it is what it is but 50 points capacity I think it's not that big of a deal but maybe if we can look at the bigger picture. Do you feel the network is over in your level of return to margins and should we be thinking outside the fleet transition this year does growth ramp back up into 18 to 19 really grow into lower term profile and expand even or, how do you view this business long term given where your returns are today. Gary Kelly : Well a fair question and \u2013 I would just offer up a couple of points I think it depends, it depends on three major levers the economy, fuel prices and competition. One thing that I don't think you all have focused on enough, is the competitive environment within the Southwest route network. So yes we're growing and producing really stellar returns. With this economic environment and as fuel price environment. But it's also in the face of very significant other airline capacity. So as I look at the fourth quarter is in it as an example. The markets that we serve we grew %% as you all know that's what we reported. But the big competitors against their base of service in our markets, grew much more than that, it was well over 6%. So there is a lot of capacity which is not too shocking given the set that southwest of the largest airline in the country. And we by definition serve the \u2013 the larger traffic pools. So if our competitors are going to grow, they're going to grow likely in our markets. But if you look at the growth of the rest of the carriers, I'll bet you 95% of their growth was in our markets. And I mention that to you just to give you a sense of how resilient Southwest is to competition. We have a great product, we have a great route network, we have a low cost, we don't charge back fees, are just a number of things that put us in a very competitive position. I think that that is the main factor for you to think about in answering that question. I think that if you go back to what Tom and Mike we're profiling. We're doing really well today, but we have ambitious plans to make Southwest only better in the future with a customer experience, with our operation but also to drive more efficiency. And in completing that strategy that should put us in a position where we can grow. How fast we grow I think will want to make that judgment on an annual basis. And maybe on a schedule by schedule basis. But the \u2013 I think the overall return under the assumption that we can continue to produce positive unit revenues, will be dependent upon where fuel prices land, and obviously that's been a main driver since 2014 and one of the reasons that we have these record returns on capital. My opinion on that is that I think we're going to continue to see pretty moderate energy prices over the next three to five years and we'll have hedging in place to protect against catastrophic increases. So that we can commit to some kind of a growth plan. But I think the returns will be very, very dependent upon that. Of course we all know how cyclical the business could be, everything that we see says that the economy is going to continue to expand for a number of years. But we all want to be careful in making commitments just in case that proves to be wrong. Brandon Oglenski : Well I appreciate the answer. As you look at your consistent results, you'll get your investment grade balance sheet and then you'll get your relative stock valuations, I mean what is the market missing in southwest stock. And what can you do as management team of the board to really try to maybe drive home that value for shareholders. Tom Nealon : Well, we need to execute. I'm very happy with the \u2013 the value that we've been returning to shareholders, I think you're holders are as well I think the stock price performance has been very good over the last five years. So we're very pleased with that and we just want to continue. I think so \u2013 I think the opportunities for us are to continue to fine tune our customer experience and our revenue production. And then we need to be aggressive in managing the cost as Mike mentioned. So I think that if I don't know that people are missing. But it's not just southwest, every company intends to get better. And I think what we have to do is demonstrate to our investors that we will in fact continue to get better and better and better and through that continue to be an industry leader, and drive superior returns. We've we have a history of demonstrating that, we have better tools and strengths in place today than we have ever had in our history, implementing a new reservation system this year is going to be a game changer it won't change the game in May, but over the course of time over the next several years we will have significant new technologies and tools, that will be deployed that will make us even stronger. So it's all about being the best in class and winning customers against our competition, our competition is better today than it ever has been we're going to continue to get better as well. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate it thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. Could you maybe Gary, kind of dope about a little bit and talk about the step up in aircraft CapEx for 2017 and just give us a sense for kind of where that money is going to go, how that is going to impact the business in the next couple years and then longer term kind of what you think about and the things you want to get done in the next five years from an investment perspective, and how that can affect kind of the run rate spending the outlook any way. Gary Kelly : Yes sir, I'd be happy to. Well first of all under the assumption that we continue on with the strategy that Tom and Mike and I are articulating here, which is to continue to operate on all Boeing 737 fleet, to continue our expansion in North America and do that at a steady pace, under that basic scenario. It feels like this is a pretty peak level of CapEx and especially given that we've accelerated these retirements, we have heavy spending to replace these retired airplanes here especially in 2017. So given that if feels like this is a peak year. The non-aircraft surge that we're seeing in addition to the airplanes in 2017, interesting for us is real estate oriented. So Mike is building a new flight training center, for which is a strategic move. And Mike can go into detail if you're interested in that, but that's in the hundreds of millions. We have other airport projects that we're investing in that are bumping up our real estate spending. The technology spending, Tammy[ph], I believe actually begins to level off in 2017. And that is largely because we're the bulk of the spending for the reservation system is behind us and I would like for our technology spending to continue to be robust but not have the levels that we have been spending, so we got a lot of technology desires here over the next several years but that spending should be leveling out. We also have a very significant technology investment underway that will complete in 2017, related to our maintenance record keeping. And that is tied directly into the \u2013 the new MAX aircraft. So those are just a couple of examples, future years we'll have other technologies that are being deferred right now. So we'll continue to have spending there but especially with the real estate Tammy I think that spending will come down and then obviously as we do as you are well aware of the aircraft spending will be significantly less, after 2018. Tammy Romo : Yes. David Vernon : Excellent. Maybe Tammy, just a follow up on the quick question on the guidance the 3% CapEx guidance, does that included training in any transition costs would be associated with the limitation other system or the fleet transition, or will there be some expectation in special charges on top of 3% guidance. Tammy Romo : It includes the cost associated with the transitioned to new reservation system, as you pointed out there are some training costs, that will occur but we've incorporated all of that into our guidance. So we are working through just on your \u2013 your question on a special items, obviously those are always difficult to predict and if any. If we had some special items as you know last quarter associated with the \u2013 with our classics fleet, just down on some of the leases that we \u2013 we bought out the equity on a few leases because that was what make most of the [indiscernible] because we were working through how to most effectively retire aircraft. Now that short of \u2013 short of that there's I think normally what we anticipate going in any year would be just a normal fuel hedge adjustment to get an economic fuel prices. David Vernon : Excellent, thanks so much for your time. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you very much. Hey Gary, in a world where Delta United American of all decided that they need a basic economy fare to compete effectively against the UCC competition. Why does Southwest not need something like that. Gary Kelly : Well, to be honest we have think it's more a question for them as to why they think they need one is as opposed to why we think we don't need one. We have a very powerful brand, and Tom, and Mike and I and all of our leaders are very strongly aligned on this. There is huge value in offering all of our customers 100% of them a great product. So when do \u2013 we like to say in Southwest there is no second class, there is no second class, in addition to that we strive to keep the customer experience and just the product offering as simple as possible. So anytime we contemplate offering customers a choice, we are we debate that heavily. Because complexity drives confusion and it clouds the brand. So what you have at Southwest is a very strong brand positioning in customers minds that we stand for friendliness, reliability and low fares. That the whole free bags and no change fees becomes a very powerful component of all that. So we don't feel like we need it but let me just take the hypothetical. So if we were to undertake a basic product we \u2013 the only thing that we could do is take away from it. We wouldn't let you make a change, you board last, you couldn't take a bag, you couldn't bring a carry on. Well that complicates the message and we've spent 45 years educating our customers as to what to expect when they come the southwest, I think that would be a huge mistake. Now that's me that's talking for me I know Tom agrees with that, and I know that Mike agrees with that, I'm not saying for ever more that Southwest would never undertake something like that, but we would have to have a darn good reason to pursue our route that way. We don't have any plans to change our seating configuration and add bigger seats, compared to littler seats. It's just back to we want everybody to have a great experience of southwest and that is our greatest strength. So we go into the market you name the big city, what is our biggest opportunity. Our especially the every other competitor they lavish they \u2013 lavish attention on elite customers and they ignore the rest and that is our biggest opportunity, because we don't ignore anybody. And we just don't want to change that. So now you look at our current results competing against all array of competitors and there's just no imperial evidence that we're missing anything. And again I \u2013 I just point to eight quarters worth of very strong performance relative to the group. That's even in the face of our competitors adding a significant amount of capacity overlapping us, and we're still producing these guys' returns, so I feel really good about where we are excited that we're always going to make it better and we certainly don't see a need to pursue a strategy like that. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, thank you for that Gary. I think this is a question for Bob, if he's on the call. Gary Kelly : Yes, Bob here. Joseph DeNardi : Yes. So estimate you guys do conservatively about a billion dollars in EBOT from Mile associate with your credit card, so feel free to comment on that if you like, but if you can tell \u2013 can you help us understand what that earnings stream would look like in a downturn, if we should we just make an assumption as to what spend would do and that's the downside or do new card sign ups in the rate you're selling the mile factor into that also. Bob Jordan : Yes, I'm going I'm going to kick it back to Tammy for more the detail. But generally we're seeing and strength all across the board. So that's cards on up six new members that's retail strength. Obviously piece of the deal we chase depended on the cards as you see large fluctuations with the economy that would drive changes in things like retail spin, you're going to see some movement. So of course right now we're seeing upside there with the strength in retail spending on the card, but generally the story has been across a very long period of time now. That business again card acquisitions, new members, [indiscernible] spend in the card is continue to be very strong for a long period of time and actually outpace the base business about how to get back to Tammy for more detail. Tammy Romo : I understand your question. The interest in getting more detail, but we\u2019re not going to provide any details really today other than what we would normally provide. But other thing I would say rather large programs has ground to be a very meaningful contribution to our revenue and bottom line and since we launched it in 2012, and as Bob, commented on already are our membership Bob, It probably more than doubled, our co-brand credit card it's been significantly accelerated. Just all the way around it's been a tremendous success, but today we are not going to provide any more detail. Gary Kelly : The only thing I might offer up and I think to fits in with your \u2013 with your earlier comment or question is that; we think we really got something here. So we relaunched completely redesign the program and launched that back in 2011, so now coming up on six years in March six years later. We are ecstatic with the success that we have had and really feel like our team nailed it. So what's driving that? Well first of all the program itself which is well known it's all public, you know how it works. And then second is the overall brand of southwest. In other words does a customer want to put their chips on the southwest, take a Southwest credit card; yes if they like Southwest. Well, if we start tinkering with the brand, we start offering the basic economy, blah, blah, blah. It will \u2013 it would risk the revenue stream and the loyal to the \u2013 loyalty that we have with that frequent flyer base. So just another \u2013 you just gave us another argument of why we want to be very thoughtful about tinkering with any changes. So my report to you is we don't have any thoughts about any radical changes to the program. And we also don't have any radical thoughts about changes to the brand. So the growth that we continue to see I think has been very, very significant and very exciting and obviously we're hopeful that that's going to continue. Joseph DeNardi : Yes, that's very helpful. Gary I would just say that I think the limited disclosures around the economics of the of the card program in the loyalty program make it very difficult for the investment community to recognize how valuable it is, so I appreciate your time. Gary Kelly : And I think that is a fair comment. And I know that Tammy, is taking that into very serious consideration. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you very much. Operator : And when you have time for one final question, we'll take that question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for the time. Can you hear me okay? Gary Kelly : Yes, we can hear you. Duane Pfennigwerth : That\u2019s great. Not a telecom analyst, an airline analyst so I figured out the phone. Gary Kelly : You're good. Duane Pfennigwerth : And tanks to let me join this call. So regarding the IT tools that you're implementing this year and sort of scheduling variability. Can you talk about where Southwest is today in terms of its ability to shape capacity by day of week and perhaps seasonally within the month. And how the tools you're implementing will change that, and what the timeline on those changes would be. Gary Kelly : Yes we can and I have several experts here. Who would like to take that question? Bob Jordan : I think it's really about incremental improvements that we have the ability today to shape passively obviously within a day, within a week, and across longer time periods and so you see. Yes very the schedule as opposed the old days [indiscernible] Southwest ran the same schedule every day, we do vary the schedule across the days of the week. You also see us making more changes to the schedule post obligations. So maybe not as much as I would like to keep fairly stable schedule for our customers but we do go in to make post publication changes. So the tools that are coming are all about incremental change of the more than they are drastic change, so we will have the ability to make \u2013 to include more variability within the day. More variability within a week to add things like red eyes if we were to choose to do that over a period of time. And this will all layer on as we were obviously one risk here in May and post that I do think we \u2013 we're going to walk into that carefully, because of one of those things that I think that customers value about the brand is that we \u2013 we have a strong schedule offering, we have a fairly stable schedule offering. So and \u2013 so will walk into that over a period time post the one raise implementation. Mike Van de Ven : Duane, this is Mike. And just follow on with what Bob, was talking about it. I've been talking a little bit about some of the operational infrastructure investments that we need to have and so. I think that we will have good commercial capabilities to have that kind of variation, we also made the same kind of operational capability, so we'll need to be able to vary our staffing at the airports. Vary our staffing with our current systems, vary our maintenance programs with aircraft availability and those are some of the things when Tom, was talking about building an operating infrastructure that scalable and gives us flexibility. Those are the kinds of things that they are investments in our infrastructure designed to give for us. Tom Nealon : And Duane, the other thing I would mention just strategically here. We decided before that will we deploy this new system that we were going to focus on the bases. And that really \u2013 it really took on two forms number one is we wanted our technology resources focused on delivering a really good reservation system, period. Secondly we wanted to allow our frontline the opportunity to get trained, and then become proficient on the basic replacement. And so we opted not to be more aggressive and pushing for value added changes, that would complicate the technology deployment and it would complicate the change management if you will. So in a different way we just need to get this preservation system replaced and we need to do it really, really well, and it is a gigantic project. So we sort of are under promising for the benefits, right now, but then the \u2013 the opportunity that you mention is something that we will absolutely want to press for as a follow on, but the way to think about it here in 2017 and particularly in the second quarter is that we are just replacing our reservation engine and that is plenty. And it's going really well, release one was extraordinarily well done. And release two is virtually done as we speak and will be spooling up our training here in about thirty days. So I think it's all \u2013 it is all rolling out exactly like we had hoped and desired. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, thanks for the time. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen will now begin our media portion. At this time I'd like to introduce Miss Linda Rutherford vice president and chief communications officer. A \u2013 Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Tom. And welcome to the numbers of our media here on afternoons call, and well get started with the meetings Q&A portion Tom, if you give them some instructions on how to queue up for questions. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And thank you for your patience and we'll take our first question from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey : Good afternoon, probably Tammy, this is for you. Maybe I missed it in all of the new releases such but there was a lot of discussion on the call about you were 3.5% capacity year-over-year addition for 2017 but what did you say or did I miss it, what is your 1Q capacity growth going to be. Tammy Romo : You're talking about our first quarter for it for this year just to make sure. We are growing our capacity about 4% year-over-year and here in first quarter. Susan Carey : 4%. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Koenig with the Associated Press. David Koenig : I'm sorry if I missed this, but I know it's very early but any color you can provide about the commentary on the pickup presidency election in red state blue state business slick we want to get away, by market, by market sheer of ULCC anything. Gary Kelly : No, I think Dave, as you know in the overall in the economy it's very broad consumer. I mean economic activity picked up, the markets picked up. I don't know that I can totally explain it I guess one could believe the theory that first of all there are certainty now you know who the president is. Second of all there is some optimism about tax reform, that would be a boost to the economy. And that regulatory reform et cetera. So I think that we're being swept up in this broader tide of optimism and it's not unique to Southwest either, the red we've seen at least we have heard from our competitors with their public comments that they've seen the same thing. What was interesting to us and Tammy's mentioned this several times, is the business travel that picked up in that sort of between holiday period. December before Christmas which can be a really low travel period many years and for whatever reason this year it was \u2013 it was pretty strong. I don't know if that's the same effect or whether it's something different, the calendar is always odd to we \u2013 we actually saw a Halloween business effect this year which was kind of interesting, probably relative to the fact that the last couple years it was over the weekend. But a lot of moms and dads will probably forgo a business trip so they stay home with their kids. I mean there's these things we run into and they are curious. But what has been pleasant for us is since early November the pickup has been sustained. We ended up with a record low tractor for the quarter and we're looking at very strong bookings here in the first quarter and at least with the traffic that we've seen so far through January it's also been quite strong. So that's \u2013 unless you guys have some other theory that's about the best I can come up with, Tammy you have any other thoughts on this. Tammy Romo : I think you captured it perfectly. David Koenig : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Edward Russell : Hi, thank you for taking my question. You mentioned that Max is on track to arrive at the end of this \u2013 third quarter, can you comment though about whether Southwest will be the first operator of the MAX other airline has said they're going to begin aircraft earlier and just curious, if you can comment on that. Mike Van de Ven : Yes, I don't \u2013 I don't really know exactly what the what other airlines are delivering plans are or when they will be operating the airplane, but has as we've been on record with we're going to operate the airplane as soon as we have the classics retired, and that is because of some of the training differences and to training challenges we would have between having tiles go between a classic and a MAX airplane. So we'll have the classics retired at the end of the third quarter and at that point Tom will launch service with a MAX. If another airline and obviously they're operating before that we\u2019ll not be the first operator, but for us it doesn't \u2013 it doesn't concern me one way or the other. Edward Russell : Okay, do you anticipate Southwest to be the first to take the first delivery if not being the first operator. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. I consider what the Southwest Airlines is a lot of customer for the MAX, we order the airplane, it's the first one off the delivery line, we are ones that have done the service ready operational validation for Boeing or the ones that are working very closely with Boeing to make sure that it is operating as they \u2013 as everyone intended, and I feel like we are a major player in that. Gary Kelly : You know, Dave, as we get this question by the way. So there I know there's an interest in the answer. But we're not really focused on that, we know that Boeing has built planes that are for Southwest of where we have got our name on them, so we don't need them for \u2013 for flying until October 1. So when aside from just readiness. When we get them like I don't think we care in the grander scheme of things but as Mike said, we're the largest customer regardless of when we take the first delivery. Edward Russell : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi everybody, good afternoon. So I was just wondering if you guys could provide a little bit of color on how you're thinking about your MAX order, anything specifically some other restricted airport that you're operating out of like in Dallas LUV or Chicago Midway, does the situation at the airport maybe you should take a look at upgrading some of your MAX orders to something like the MAX-9 were even the MAX-10\u2026 Gary Kelly : No. At this time we are committed to eight. We are the launch customer on the seven which comes Mike and 2020. Mike Van de Ven : 2019. Gary Kelly : 2019, and so that's it. We think that the eight is the right airplane for us. We'll use the MAX-7 and it may prove to be a bigger player in our strategy on longer term, but right now our focus is more on the eight and that's mainly because the 800 mix of our 700 plus airplane fleet is still a minority of the airplanes that we'd like for it to play a bigger role, so that will be the emphasis for a while. We don't have any need at this point for a bigger than the eight airplane and there is not any effort within Southwest exploring anything beyond that, just taken the MAX-8 and then the MAX-7. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great and then if I could ask just one follow up one additional question could you maybe comment a little bit on the early performance and you're seeing on your [indiscernible]. Gary Kelly : Yes it's early. And the load factors look fine. It is a weak part of the year seasonally. And what I've been. Bob, I've been actually pleasantly surprised at the demand from Cubans flying to the U.S and back a lot of times with our international routes and the again you have to understand that we're new at this, we've only been flying international about two and a half years. A lot of our markets we've built up the airplanes with U.S citizens only operate and coming back. In this case where we're getting a fair amount of local traffic coming to the U.S as well. But it's way too early to tell, we need to go through a full annual cycle and see what this is like. I get asked all the time about whether it's meeting or expectations. I didn't have any expectations I mean I don't know how you would know, because we have \u2013 we have there has been air service to Cuba for 50 years, so the fact that we've got people on the airplanes I think is really good. And just lastly, with the way we approach new markets we're \u2013 we're very well prepared that the initial response could be rather weak. And we have a lot of experience in being patient in stimulating the market getting people to notice that we're there and change their travel habits and have a lot of success of course under our belt with that approach. So I'm happy with the initial results. There is nowhere near where we want them to be eventually, but at this point don't have any reason to believe that they can't get there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : At this time I'd like to turn the call back to Mrs. Rutherford for any final remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thanks so much, Tom. Thank you all for your time and questions this afternoon and if you as always have any follow you can reach a member of our communications group at 2147924847 or via the online user at wamedia.com. Thank you very much. Operator : And that concludes the call for today. Thank you for joining.",

Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram David Koenig - The Associated Press Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Operator : Welcome to Southwest Airlines' First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. My name is Tom and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Marcy Brand - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our first quarter 2017 performance. Please note, today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. Joining me on the call today we have, Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. We will begin with Gary providing an overview of our performance, followed by Tammy providing a more detailed review of our first quarter results and current outlook. Following Tammy's remarks, all of our call participants will be available to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. It was another strong performance with an operating margin of almost 13% despite higher fuel prices. For the first time in a while, the First Call consensus estimate for the quarter was too high by $0.02. However, our revenue and cost performances were both within our expectations. Our revenue expectations were reset, of course, in March, down 2% to 3% for the quarter. For costs ex-fuel and profitsharing, we came in always slightly over our budget and at the high-end of the range, but the quarter includes a lot of noise with year-over-year union contract increases and settlements as well as our final readiness for the launch of our new reservation system, which is in 12 days. Revenue trends were solid for the quarter and that they improved slightly compared to fourth quarter. I was hoping for more improvement than that, but it appears that first quarter GDP was soft, and we also had a lot of weather impacts in the quarter as well and that was particularly in California. But at least, we didn't lose any momentum that was gained in the fourth quarter. But importantly, the second quarter trends suggest a significant improvement, benefiting somewhat from the Easter holiday timing, but more significantly from a strengthening yield environment. So I feel like we're experiencing an inflection point between the fourth, first, and second quarters. We have positive unit revenue trends in April thus far, and we're estimating to be up 1% to 2% for all of the second quarter on a RASM basis. Second quarter cost trends are pretty similar to first quarter but better year-over-year. We've had the same cost drivers in that we have the snap-up in union labor rates and costs associated with our technology implementations. So these year-over-year trends improved dramatically in the second half of the year. That is the year-over-year unit cost trends. And as we said in the release, we are on plan for the year with our unit costs ex fuel and profitsharing. So with improving revenue trends, despite somewhat higher fuel cost per gallon than a year ago, once again, we're hopeful that our second quarter EPS will compare much better to the year ago than the first quarter did versus a year ago. Our goal is positive year-over-year comparisons for EPS in the second half of this year. And, of course, that's dependent on a lot of things but certainly on the yield environment and fuel prices. But that is our goal is to have second half EPS growth. With respect to capacity, there is no change from our year-end report in January. We've got 3.5% available seat mile growth planned for this year, and we're scheduled out into the third quarter. And that's including less than 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Following the fourth quarter, I expect the first half next year to come in less than 4% and also each quarter. And along those lines, there has been no change to our fleet plans for 2017 or 2018 other than the fact that we exercised five -800 options as planned for 2018 delivery. So we're still retiring all of the Classics by the end of September of this year. There's 79 of them remaining. We started this year with 723 aircraft in the fleet. We still plan to end this year, after grounding the Classics, with 703 aircraft. With the firm commitments that we have for deliveries for next year, that will take us to 746 aircraft at the end of 2018, which is within our fleet growth target of no more than 2% through the end of next year. We have four unexercised options for 2018. So if we exercised those, of course, that would put us at 750 airplanes, which is what we have in the press release. So we're approaching our 2017 and 2018 growth cautiously. We're managing the grounding of the Classics, which potentially makes for some comparability noise in late 2018. But as we said in the release, in any event, our full year growth will be below 2016, as we had previously indicated. So no new news on any of those fronts. We're very excited about this year. We're ready to deploy our new reservation system in 12 days. We're on track to open the new international concourse at Ft. Lauderdale's Terminal 1 in June. We're ready to launch international flights out of that new terminal, including Grand Cayman as a new destination. And as we reported this morning, we'll be adding another new destination to Fort Lauderdale. And that will be Turks & Caicos, and that will be in fourth quarter of this year. Separately, we're very excited to round out our 48-state route map with new service to Cincinnati cranking up in June. And finally, we're excited and on track to launch the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and that's scheduled for October 1. My thanks and congratulations to Boeing and GE for producing a magnificent airplane and one that we are confident will be the low-cost leader of the narrow-body market. Now this is the best start that we've had to a year in my memory, and that's considering our operations, our customers, and our economics all in the aggregate. I am very proud of our people. They run a great airline every single day. Last week, we just celebrated our Annual ProfitSharing Day, and today, we celebrate another strong performance. So again, congratulations to all of them and thank you to all 54,000-plus Southwest warriors. So, Tammy, with that quick overview, I'll turn it over to you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: All right, thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to start by extending my thanks and congratulations as well to our employees on a strong start to the year. Our first quarter profits were a strong $351 million and excluding special items, $372 million. This produced first quarter operating margins of 13.5% and 12.8% excluding special items, which were very strong and looks to be among the industry-leading performances and would have been even stronger without our fuel hedge losses which will burn off by year-end. Coming into the quarter, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons. The revenue yield environment, which was stable but still competitive and the Easter shift to April from March last year created challenging comparisons. And as Gary mentioned, we were also impacted by the severe weather in California. On the cost side, last year's first quarter fuel prices were much lower. We also had cost pressures from higher wage rates associated with our amended union contracts as well as various costs associated with the upcoming implementation of our new reservation system. Our balance sheet, liquidity, cash flows, and ROIC were also strong in the first quarter. On balance, I'm very pleased with the strength of our first quarter results, which enabled the continuation of significant returns for our shareholders and $99 million of profitsharing for our employees. We're off to a great start here in the second quarter with encouraging revenue trends. Our first quarter revenue performance was strong with record passenger revenues and a strong demand environment. Operating revenues were also a first quarter record and declined 2.8% on a unit basis. This RASM performance was within our range of guidance and relatively in line on a sequential basis. While the biggest driver of the year-over-year decline in first quarter RASM was the competitive yield environment, it does feel like we have hit an inflection point here in April. Other revenues also had another strong performance, driven by Rapid Rewards and other ancillary sources of revenues, especially EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding products. And we expect another year-over-year increase in other revenues in second quarter 2017. Overall, as we noted in our earnings release, second quarter RASM is estimated to increase in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. Even without the Easter benefit of approximately $10 million, our year-over-year unit revenue trends are currently positive. Our second quarter RASM outlook is encouraging and represents roughly four points of year-over-year sequential improvement. Turning to cost. Our first quarter cost performance was within our expectations. Low fuel prices in first quarter last year drove challenging year-over-year fuel comparisons and a 10.1% increase in our economic fuel price. In the current environment of higher fuel prices, our fleet modernization and other fuel saving initiatives are meaningful, especially as we get to the second half of the year and our Classics are retired. In first quarter, our fuel gallons increased less than our capacity, resulting in fuel efficiency gains year-over-year. Based on market prices last Friday and our current second quarter hedge position, we expect our second quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.95 to $2 per gallon range. Our second quarter fuel cost estimate includes $0.29 in hedging losses, which is also the amount of hedging loss we expect for third and fourth quarters based on our current hedge position and market prices. With fuel hedge losses significantly below where they were last year, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon in second half of this year to decrease year-over-year. So, for the full year 2017, we currently estimate a fuel price per gallon in the $1.95 to $2 range. Excluding fuel, our unit costs increased largely due to higher wage rates from labor contracts as well as approximately $40 million in costs associated with our new reservation system and operational initiatives. Our second quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profitsharing, is expected to increase approximately 6% year-over-year, with about 3.5 points of this increase related to the labor contracts amended last year. The remaining increase relates to costs associated with our technology and operational initiatives as well as the rollout of our new uniforms. Our full year 2017 unit cost outlook remains unchanged. And excluding fuel, special items and profitsharing, we expect 2017 unit costs to increase approximately 3% year-over-year, almost entirely driven, when it's all said and done, by the one snap-up in wage rates from the new labor contracts. This includes our expectation that unit costs will trend to flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Considering our modest capacity growth plan for fourth quarter, our unit cost outlook is quite notable, and we are not stopping there. We are very focused on controlling our costs to drive incremental efficiencies and widen our competitive cost advantage. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with our industry-leading investment-grade balance sheet, which is strong as ever. Similar to last year's first quarter, we allowed our cash to build as we funded our 2016 profitsharing accruals, as Gary mentioned, earlier this month. Our strong operating cash flow and manageable CapEx resulted in a record first quarter free cash flow of $1.2 billion. For full year 2017, our cash flow outlook remains strong, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $2.3 billion. Aircraft CapEx is estimated to be $1.4 billion, and non-aircraft spend is estimated to be in the $800 million to $900 million range, which includes $250 million of technology spend on our reservation system and operational initiatives. During first quarter, we returned $673 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Our shareholder returns increased almost 13% year-over-year and in the first quarter alone we have given back more than a third of our total shareholder returns for all of last year. In addition to completing the $300 million accelerated share repurchase launched in fourth quarter of 2016, we launched and completed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase during first quarter. We also repurchased $50 million of common stock in open market transactions, which leaves $400 million remaining under our current $2 billion buyback authorization. In March, we paid our 162nd consecutive dividend at an annual payout ratio of nearly 11%. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is now just over 30%. And as ever, preserving our strong balance sheet and cash flows remains a priority, and we also remain committed to returning significant value to shareholders. Turning now to fleet and capacity. Our plans continue to support prudent and profitable network growth. We ended the quarter with 727 aircraft in our fleet and continue to expect our total fleet to decline to just over 700 aircraft by year-end. This incorporates the retirement of the remaining 79 Classics by the end of September and the addition of 41 more NG aircraft and 14 MAX-8s this year. We're very excited about the launch of the MAX into service this October, which we expect will bring continued fuel efficiency gains. Just on the network side, it's performing very well. Our upcoming consolidation of our Ohio operations, including the launch of service to Cincinnati, is a prime example of how we continue to optimize our network to meet the needs of our customers. And with the transformative strategic initiatives behind us, including the May 9 implementation of our new reservation system, we are well-positioned to consider the exciting growth opportunities ahead. We're monitoring our new market development closely and we'll continue to add markets at a pace that supports our revenue and profitability targets. Our 2017 capacity growth remains unchanged at approximately 3.5% year-over-year. With this brief overview, I'll just close here again by congratulating our employees on a great quarter and exciting year ahead. So, with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. We'll now begin with our first question, comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You bet, Jack. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: So, Gary, if I can go back to your prepared comments for a moment, you referenced the 2018 capacity plans. And I know you don't want to get into those in too much depth because the plan is still coming together. But you said the plan was to have around 4% ASM growth in the first half, but then you referenced quarterly growth and then I think you said more challenging comps in the fourth quarter. If you could just expand on that for a moment if you would, and just to make sure we're all on the same page on what 2018 should look like from a capacity growth perspective? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'd be happy to. And I'm just going to repeat what I said, Jack. There is no more than \u2013 it will be less than 4%. It won't be 4%, it will be less than 4% for the first quarter and for the second quarter and obviously for the first half combined. And I'm comfortable in sharing that with you at this point. And beyond that, I'm not willing to give any specific targets. My only reference on the fourth quarter is that because fourth quarter this year may be closer to flat year-over-year, and once we start restoring the flyings that we were doing with the grounded Classics, we'll see some growth that is higher than normal in the fourth quarter for sure. However, and I want to be clear on this, we have not committed to a schedule for the second half of 2018, where as time goes by, we're getting more and more committed, of course, to the first half. But I think the overriding message is the same as what we've been saying and that we're still approaching our capacity growth cautiously. One of the things that we were trying to accomplish in 2017, and if necessary by extension, into 2018, is to give our developing markets an opportunity to mature and put ourselves in a position where we are confident that positive unit revenue growth is realistic. So, those will continue to be the guiding principles. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you for that clarification. And then for my follow-up question, if I could ask about the new reservation system rollout, just sort of curious what sort of preparations have you guys been making sort of going into this rollout here over the next couple of weeks? And if you could help us think about the incremental costs that are maybe flowing through to P&L related to training and that sort of thing that maybe roll off, I guess, as we get into the back half of the year. And then just the priorities around utilizing the new system, because I know it will give you significantly increased capabilities once it's rolled out. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I'd be happy to and I'll defer to Tammy to give you some further insights on the cost implications here. But this is a multiyear effort, Tom, this has been under development for three years. And so it is fair to assume that a lot of technology construction occurred prior to this year, but they're still in the finishing up phases. So we have a fairly significant spending in the first quarter related to the technology efforts. A lot of testing, of course, is taking place at this point. And then from Mike Van de Ven's perspective, Mike, I think you were training 20,000 employees, weren't you? So we have a lot of our call agents already prepared to take orders on the first part of the release, which was back in December, but they still had continued training here this year. And then all of our airport employees, we refer to as ground operations, are undergoing the training for the new departure systems. So it's very significant. It's all hands on deck. It's a fairly significant amount of spending. The other thing that is beyond just \u2013 as you can imagine, the training is additional time on our employees' part. So both the commercial departments previously and our operations departments have increased their staffing to make sure that number one, we have the time available for the training, and then number two, to be prepared for a learning curve where transactions might take more time. So you do note that the employee head count is up roughly 7% \u2013 I think it's 7.3% year-over-year. And that's a lot of that \u2013 that's a lot of the cost for that increase. Tammy, you want to speak more directly to the cost implications of that? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure, I'd be happy, happy to do that. As I mentioned in my comments, we had about $40 million in costs in the first quarter associated with our new reservation system and operational initiative. And so as I think about our comparisons in the first half versus the second half, we have probably 1 point to 2 points related to the wind-down of our reservation system and timing of efficiencies related to our operational investments. So, it is significant and we'll get some relief here as we move into the second half of the year. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So, I think to summarize, we definitely staffed up for the effort. And then there's sort of a final push with technology people, our technology partners. And it shows up in our spending. There's no question. If you look in the other operating expenses line, you'll see that it's up, don't have it in front of me, I think it's 12 point \u2013 maybe 11%. But in any event, there's a pretty large increase in that category. So there are a lot of the technology-related costs that are hitting in that line item. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you again for the time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mr. Linenberg, please check your mute button, we cannot hear you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Mike, you there? We can't hear you. Operator : We will go ahead and move on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Hey, thank you. Appreciate the question. Sorry for a modeling question, but to get to the full year guide, it looks like it also implies that the third quarter is going to be a pretty muted growth rate in CASM X as well. Could you explain what would be driving that? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. And just to kind of help you as we progress here from the first half to the second half on our unit costs, we already mentioned that about 1 point to 2 points of the cost pressures were experienced here in the first quarter is related to our reservation system and the timing of efficiencies related to our operational investments. We have probably a point related to the timing of our union contracts. And then also as you move into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to see savings associated with the retirement of our Classic fleet. So that's about a point, which you'll see reflected in lower depreciation and maintenance costs. And then that probably accounts for most of it. I'm not ready to give you specific guidance on third quarter versus fourth quarter. But I do think that by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we should be, call it, roughly flat to year-ago levels, excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, is there a plan to update your thinking on capital allocation at your Annual Shareholders' Meeting, or are you going to follow that typical cadence? And if so, any new thoughts or looking backwards, buyback versus dividends, any new thoughts in that perspective? Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, we haven't done anything so far. So there's nothing to report today. We have a board meeting in May, and of course, that is a board-level decision. And we would \u2013 we've had discussions, as you would expect, with our board. We meet every other month, so we meet 6 times a year, so we had a March meeting, but have made no firm decisions or commitment \u2013 made no commitments yet. So, it's something that we'll take up in May, Duane, it's a very fair question. And I think all I would say is to reiterate what Tammy said and I think I've said, which is we're very focused on shareholder returns. Those are two key questions and we'll certainly discuss that again in May. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Thanks, Gary. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for getting me on the call here. Gary, I appreciate the outlook on capacity here at least through the first half of 2018. But as you're going through your reservation system cutover and the fleet transition, should we be thinking that this is more an outlook on low capacity growth, because you're physically constrained? Or should we be thinking that actually, this is what the market feels (31:09) so this is where we're growing, and if we saw better opportunities, we'd be growing faster even with those constraints today? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I've tried to be clear on that. So, you quiz me if I'm not hitting the mark here. I think, first of all, there's a fairly long cycle between the time that you decide that you want to add capacity and when it finally shows up. So there is some physical nature to all of this. We are growing 3.5% this year. Some of that admittedly is because we're accelerating the retirement of the Classics. However, we've been straightforward with you all and said that we did want to slow our growth this year, so that was \u2013 it was a factor in us arriving at the decision to go ahead and accelerate the retirement of that fleet, if you understand my point. Said a different way, if we really felt like we needed to be growing faster this year and we just had to have lift, I bet we would probably have tried to find a way, Mike, to keep those airplanes. So, the stars aligned pretty well for us there. The other thing that Mike has done a beautiful job of, especially over the last four years to five years, is creating more fleet flexibility for us. And so I mentioned purposefully with my remarks that right now, we're fully committed with deliveries that would suggest that we'll end 2018 at 746 airplanes. We have the option to get four more and we haven't exercised that yet. We haven't made that decision yet. So the answer to your question is both of those are inputs, but what we're trying to do mostly is match our capacity to the demand. We want to grow our route system. We want to grow it in a way that we can sustain positive unit revenue growth as well as hit our ROIC and our profit targets. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think it's been articulated, Gary. I think it's helpful for investors to hear that message over and over. I guess, the fear would be though that as your fuel hedge losses run out next year, is there to be temptations as wow, now we're just naturally making more money, so maybe we should be growing more than we had? Or is that not really factoring into the outlook? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, of course, it is. In other words, if you just \u2013 logic would say the reverse. If we weren't making money, would we be going out and growing? Well, of course not. You need to fix what you have first before you think about growing. But our margins are really good right now. They're near industry-leading margins that everybody here has worked hard for and is very proud of. So we don't want to extrapolate record returns on capital into infinity and adjust growth plans to that notion. That would be very imprudent to do. So we're not doing that. We haven't done that. We've tried to be clear that in particular, the growth rates that we realized in 2015 and 2016 were unusual, and you should not expect that we think that we should be growing at those rates going forward. But I think it's mainly a matter of just, we want to grow and we need to grow. We need to strengthen our route system. It's a very competitive industry out there, and that's one of the key weapons that we have. But we need to do that in a way that we can make sure that we sustain our profitability, our balance sheet, shareholder returns, all of those things. I think we've done a nice job of balancing all that, and there's a 46-year history here and there's no reason to believe that we're going to deviate from those objectives. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate the insight. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, sir. Operator : And we'll take our next question \u2013 actually, we'll go back to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, can you guys hear me now? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We can hear you now, you can do a telephone commercial, yes. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I got to move up on my phone here. Hey, I guess two quick ones. I guess, Gary, back to your introductory remarks. You talked about a real strengthening in yields, what you saw coming into the June quarter. And I think, Tammy, you mentioned about an inflection point in April. And I think if we can move Easter aside, are you seeing it on the close-in booking side? Is it leisure-driven? Like what's \u2013 like this uptick, where are you seeing it, what passenger segments? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Happy to speak to that. Yes, I know I'm delighted to speak about revenues because we are encouraged by our outlook here in the second quarter. And, Mike, we're really seeing \u2013 it's pretty broad-based improvement in our sequential trends. So, yes, so, I think it's really just a broader comment. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then just my second question on, Gary, for 2018 first half, you said less than 4% in the March and June quarter. How do we think about the split between domestic and international? Like what \u2013 is it 1/3, 2/3? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Let me just \u2013 I'm going to think out loud with you because I don't know, I can give you at least a sense of direction there. But we're going to end this year with a capacity split of about 96% domestic and 4% \u2013 not quite 4%, so it's about 96%-plus and a little bit less than 4% international. We're growing international pretty aggressively here in 2017. It feels to me like it will grow less aggressively in 2018. And that's an understanding that we haven't made firm commitments here and we'll debate those as long as we can. We've decided recently that we were going to go ahead and commit to Turks and Caicos. This relates somewhat to the previous question about how much of this is fixed versus variable. Well, we're committed to this 5-Gate Concourse construction in Fort Lauderdale. We obviously want to follow that through with having a decent array of international flying and so that's a pretty aggressive launch of international for us this year because of that. And then next year, we're purposefully going to throttle back a bit to again allow these new markets some time to develop. But we don't have a lot of new flying that we're adding this year. A lot of the year-over-year increase is simply the full year effect of adding routes last year. So this is a pretty conservative year. And I think next year, except for some of the comparability issue maybe fourth quarter year-over-year, it's going to be a pretty routine year, it feels like. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everybody. How are you? Gary, last quarter, you referred to potential ATC reform as being, I take these for your words, I'm paraphrasing here, highly beneficial for your customers and your employees, something along those lines. My concern obviously is that it would potentially free up airplane time. That would lead to higher capacity, and we kind of know how that movie plays out. How does ATC reform help Southwest? And how much capacity would it potentially free up? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Jamie, let's not make a good thing a bad thing. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...to be more efficient. The problem that we have today, and I'm sure my colleagues, if you ask them or you may have already \u2013 they may have already made these comments, but we're already seeing increased delays this year being imposed by the FAA because of staffing shortages. So the on-time performance of the industry is pretty good and inarguably very good. Well, all that means is that we've simply adjusted our flight times to be longer, anticipating increasing inefficiencies. And every year, we get more. So it's as simple as taking city A to city B and those en route times are just far greater today or the total block time I should say, far greater today than they were 10 years, 20 years, much less 30 years ago. So what I would argue for our investors and certainly for the company is that we'll provide better customer service, which ought to be healthier demand and we'll be able to provide these flights far more efficiently, which ought to be less cost and more affordable for our customers. So it's a double win for the customer, but it's just a \u2013 what company would choose to operate less efficiently? It's just nonsensical. So, the other thing I would tell you is that we know that there is a premium part of the day that people want to fly. And to the extent that we can push more of our flying into the mid of the day, we know that, that will also be more productive. Will it create the opportunity for more capacity? Yes, but we have that opportunity already, so we already choose to fly more or less in a given period this year. We could be flying more and we're choosing not to for a variety of reasons. So I wouldn't make a good thing a bad thing. I think back to the good thing, it's going to be \u2013 it's going to take a huge effort to realize the benefits of ATC modernization. And right now, it's not being realized whatsoever that we're getting less efficient, not more. So you don't have to worry about that anytime soon, unfortunately, but that is the right goal and I think the President is behind that and we've got a long way to go to actually realize it. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And second, on the res system, I thought, suggested somewhere that it's the current res system that explains why don't fly red eyes. And that doesn't really make sense to me because you have something like, I don't know, 75, 80 flights every day that leave on one day and arrive after midnight the next. So I always thought it was how you've flowed aircraft for maintenance, which explain the aversion to red eyes. Was I just mistaken all these years? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, I don't think you're totally mistaken. But Mike, you want to talk about some of this \u2013 the current mechanics and restrictions that we have? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, so Jamie on the operating side, we do have flights that go across midnight that our flight planning systems are designed to take that to a certain point. So let's say, I don't know that I have the hour right in my head, but let's say, to 2 o'clock in the morning but to go... Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: And after that, our systems aren't set up to go do that. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And Jamie, you are right. I mean, the airline does have an AM, it has a PM and then that's sort of the third shift of the day, we do dedicate to overnight maintenance. So once we under \u2013 under the assumption that we're going to undertake a significant amount of 'red-eye flying,' we would have to figure all that out. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We have to negotiate with our flight crews over that other crewing period or... Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: We have those covered in our contracts, but they're difficult because it's hard to put together three-day pairings if you don't have a sufficient number of red-eye flying. And you're exactly right, Jamie, it introduces complexity with respect to the maintenance programs at night. We can navigate through all of those things, but we just haven't had to do that at this point in time in our lives. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It doesn't sound like it's going to be a priority either? Or is \u2013 am I mistaken on that as well? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, again, if you're wondering whether we truly have the capability today, we don't. In our minds. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We don't have the tools that we would need. And then if that would \u2013 then if you're concerned that, that capability now leads to yet more capacity, we've got a lot of discussion that we need to have before we decide to commit to any meaningful amount of red-eye flying. And it is not, as we sit here in the second quarter of 2017, it is \u2013 we've got a lot other things we're working on and it is not a priority for us. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Very interesting stuff. I'll let everybody else take it back to RASM and CASM, but I really appreciate that operational overview. Thanks, both gentlemen. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the time. This might be for you, Gary. But as far as the new reservation system that's set to come into place in I guess 12 days or so, can you talk about some of the more prominent features you're seeing benefits from, whether it's scheduling or something else? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Tom, you want to talk about that? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. So let me cover that one. So, you guys know December, we rolled out the first release, right? And that was our last published selling schedule. With R2, which is 12 days away, with the function is there, those are the functions that are really going to be used by the frontline for check-in, boarding passengers, re-accom, that kind of stuff. The third release, which is on track for the second half of 2017, that's where you really begin to see the value come through, right? So, the kind of capabilities you're talking about there, and this is what gets you the $200 million in EBIT, where you really get to there are the revenue enhancements, probably two big capabilities, one being controls and improved fare flexibility and such, schedule optimization with that third release, which is scheduled variation, days of inventory, things like that. And it also sets the foundation for the international work, right? So one res sets the foundation for airline codeshare, foreign point-of-sale, language, currency, that kind of stuff, but that's really the back half of 2017 when that will begin to come out live, the value begins to be really kick in, in 2018 and beyond. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. And then a quick question on capacity. Gary, would it be fair to say that what you're trying to point to for next year, that capacity growth will be between 2015 and 2016 levels so that's 3.5% and 5.5%? Or is that getting too granular at this point? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's too early to say. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes sir. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning guys. Just on the \u2013 just a little bit on the pricing side to go back to that, and Tammy, I think you mentioned that things are improving and looking very encouraging. How much of that \u2013 and you mentioned competitive pricing still prevalent. What I'm trying to figure out is, is this just a fact of peak season is good and strong and in the off-peak, we just have too much capacity and thinking through what the implications are close to summer season then for pricing. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't think so, but I think anything is possible. If you go back to last June, you might remember that we were a bit surprised at the sort of sudden weakening in demand. And that seemed to continue all the way until the fourth quarter, at which time we were pleasantly surprised at the strengthening in demand. I really thought we would do a little better in the first quarter this year. It wasn't bad. It didn't slip, but it didn't improve as much as we thought. And I made my GDP comment earlier. We've all read about the delay in tax refunds and the impact that that had on consumer spending. I don't know if that had some impact. But we're trying to take all those questions, Savi, into account. And taking that into account, we're saying that there is a trend improvement sequentially. And I'm not attributing that to the seasonality. We've got years of history here. And we've moved holidays around and take all those kinds of things into effect, our own growth rate, et cetera, et cetera. So the yield environment is improving. And in terms of the competition, that's about all we can say at that point, but it is definitely improving compared to what we were seeing last year. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Very helpful, Gary. Thank you and just as a follow-up quickly ask on the hedge assets in 2018 and 2019, just how much of that is in 2018 and how much 2019? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. So on \u2013 for 20 \u2013 you said 2018 and 2019, Savi? Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Exactly. Yeah. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: So 2018 is about $75 million of that. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: So that would leave $33 million for 2019. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're very welcome. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks so much for squeezing me in Team. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're welcome. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: I hope it's a good question. So I think about your growth on the West Coast in California. Is that more opportunity out there? Is it kind of defending the market against incursion from Alaska and Virgin? Is it neither of the above and something else entirely? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's a very strong market. I would say post-recession, sort of post-2007, there was a kind of a typical recessionary effect on short-haul travel. And there's a lot of short-haul travel in the Southwest system in California. So we optimized our route system. And I'd say over the last several years, we've seen a resurgence in the travel demand there. And we've struggled a bit to keep up with it. So that's one, the travel demand is quite strong and we see a lot of opportunities. I would couple that though with real estate challenges. So LAX, we're capacity constrained on the ground. We have that problem in Orange County. It's just two quick examples. So we have more opportunities to grow, except that we just don't have the physical capability to do that with some of our airport constraints there. But where we don't have that, yes, we've had great opportunities and I think that you'll continue to see us very focused on California. And it's not just us. There's a handful of competitors that are also eyeing California. But it's a great, healthy market and we remain the number one share within and out and to. And any way you look at it, so we're very proud of our position there. And we're going to work hard to stay on top. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then can I just follow-up one question on something you said about facility constraints? As we think about this over the next \u2013 or as you think about it, right, your plans for the next three to five years as you think about the fleet planning and the growth and so on, how should we think about this in terms of infrastructure? How does the infrastructure keep up with the demand that's out there? And is that going to be a very expensive proposition for the industry or the government or the industry because the government can't afford to do it? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, great question, and of course, you've known us for a long time. If you go back to 30 years ago, we didn't have the array of physical constraints on the ground that we face today. Some of that is just because we \u2013 from the sheer fact that we've lowered fares, stimulated demand and we've built facilities, and we've now filled out that capacity. It's an issue and it's easy to take LAX as a specific example. LAX has billions of dollars' worth of construction programs that are planned probably over the next decade and maybe even beyond. We've got one that \u2013 we have two in effect that are underway, and we're hopeful that we'll get a third in order to create capacity. I want to say that the \u2013 over the last decade, don't quote me on this, but I think I'll get this right, over the last decade, there've been about $100 billion worth of airport projects undertaken. So the money is there. And I think the \u2013 if we can sort of remove some barriers so that we can proceed more expeditiously at certain airports, that would be very, very helpful. But if you just take a specific \u2013 and all of these need to be taken up specifically, there are a lot of airports where we have plenty of capacity. And we're trying to take full advantage of that and expand there. There are airports like Dallas, Love Field, which is at capacity under federal law. So that's sort of off the table in terms of increasing capacity for the airport because it's limited to 20 gates. And there's every flavor in between across the country. The nice thing for us selfishly is because we're a point-to-point network, and we have a very significant position in dozens of cities, if we're constrained in one market, we've got opportunities in another. And quite frankly, that helps us prioritize because we have far more things that we want to do than we have airplanes. But it's just the fact that we live with. We have an airport affairs department that is focused on working airport by airport and helping to develop master plans that are sensible so that these communities can grow. You'd hate to live in a city that said no, we're forevermore capped at the current level of travel and tourism. So you just have to ask yourself as a civic leader, what are we going to do for the next generation? Are we going to promote travel or not in our community? And again -- but that's the way it works, but the money is there. We just want to make sure that the money is spent wisely and spent in the right places. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much for that. I appreciate it. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're very welcome. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd first like to introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Tom. Welcome today to the members of the media who are on the call. I think we can go ahead and get started in our Q&A session. So, Tom if you'll give them some instructions on how to queue up. Operator : Yes, ma'am. Thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Gary, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about that comment from CNBC today about Southwest ending the practice of overbooking. How soon do you think that policy will go into effect? And can you talk a little bit about the tradeoffs? My understanding is that there's at least some revenue implication to overbooking flights? How much do you guys think you might be giving up by not doing that anymore? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, what I was trying to convey, and thanks for the question, what I was trying to convey this morning on that is it's not a topic that is brand new to us. So for quite some time, we have been challenging ourselves to make the travel experience better for our customers and just make the service better for our employees to deliver. And that's one of the pain points that I'd like to eliminate. The issue is the economic effect. As time has gone by, we have been fortunate to have fewer and fewer and fewer no shows. So the gross amount of the problem is far less today than it was 20 years ago. We don't overbook much at all already. My recollection, Bob, is that it's about, on a 143-seat airplane, we might overbook by 1. And it's hard to generalize but it at least gives you some frame of reference. This isn't a vast issue. And we don't \u2013 I never get complaints from our customers about overbooking. I get complaints about any other variety of things. I'm not saying there aren't complaints, and don't get me wrong. But it's just not an issue the way the company has been managing that, and I'm very proud of our folks who are doing that. But to give you a specific answer, I'm not quite ready to give you an exact timeline, but we're going to move on this very quickly, so certainly during the second quarter. And it's \u2013 we've got Tom Nealon, our President; Bob Jordan, our EVP of Commercial, are both personally working on this. It turns out that it's a little more complicated than perhaps we would like. But I think our employees will be delighted at this, and I know our customers will be. Then, again, understanding that we don't have that many over-sales in the first place. The economic effect of it, Tammy, you want to speak to that? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. The economic impact is really fairly, fairly small. Yes, there is a little bit of a revenue impact, but that's been embedded in all the guidance that we've discussed this morning. But there is also some cost savings that will occur that will offset the revenue benefit. So the net impact is really not that meaningful. So I really don't think you'll even see it in our results. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: If I... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: One of the other questions I got, Conor, this morning, which might help put it in perspective, well, isn't this going to cost you money? Well, what we're trying to do is be the world's most loved airline. And we feel like just putting this in with no change fees, no bag fees, no overbooking, that's who we are. And we're at a point now where we can do all of that and still stay true to our low-fare brand. And, obviously, the reason that we do overbooking is because it helps generate revenue on that flight and keep the rest of the fares lower. So we don't want to do this in a way that would cost our customers more money. And we think we're at a point now where we can do that, and it just makes sense. So we've been thinking about it for a long time and feel like right now is the time to do it. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: I appreciate the answer. If I could ask one more follow-up, how much did the United Airline incident with the overbooking have to play in announcing? And now did you guys speed up your timeline as a result of that? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: It was \u2013 and I'll be honest with you. It wasn't on my list this month to work on. It wasn't on Tom's. It wasn't on Bob's list. But it is something that we have had on our list over the last couple of years. But it puts the question under a bright light. And, hey, why not do it now? I would ask. And we're ready to do it and we're going to get it done. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, Gary, if you might be able to comment on the pay increases that American announced yesterday. We've seen some Wall Street analysts say this sets a dangerous precedent or a worrying precedent, I should say, through the industry. I know you just signed a four-year agreement with your pilot group in the last year. Is that something you guys ever considered or do you think your pilots group might be coming back and asking now for additional raises when they're not in the contract negotiation? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I'm going to answer your question in two ways. Number one is just philosophically, we've always worked with our employees that way. Contracts are a framework to work together. And that's a true partnership. And things come up in between contract negotiation dates. We approach union leadership and union leadership approaches us. And so we make changes historically, quote, all the time. And we've had instances in my recollection where we felt like we needed to make some change to pay along the way. And it's just remembering that nothing is simple when it comes to a labor contract or a labor contract negotiation. So it \u2013 we'll just have to see how simple it is for American to actually execute what they want. I read their communication. I thought it was very well done. But is it a dangerous precedent? No. I mean it is a framework. It's a living document. The only way that works though is if you have a true partnership where issues can \u2013 in a dynamic way, can continue to be addressed. At the same time, I think everybody understands that it is a contract. Both parties to a contract want to and need to honor what's in the contract, and there needs to be very good reasons to contemplate a change. But is it dangerous? No. And I think it's just part of ongoing negotiations and Herb always said that we negotiate our contracts every single day, and I agree with that. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram: Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Hi, thanks. Gary, back to the overbooking issue. One little thing. My understanding is, okay, so you're not going to do over-sales at some point but you might still have to bump people if you have crews showing up that need to be accommodated. And secondly, was this change motivated by the fact that last year you bumped -- you had more IDBs than anybody else? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: The answer to the latter one is no, and if you want, I can -- again, by my memory, I can talk to that and Bob may know off the top of his head who, no doubt, knows a lot more about than I do. But the -- and I think overbooking is different than having an over-sale. So if we have a rule that says we won't take any more bookings than there are seats on the airplane, that's one thing. But you're right, David, there's other things that can cause an over-sale. For one thing, we have different airplane sizes. So if, for whatever reason, we took bookings for an 800, which has more than 143 seats and then that airplane type is not available and we substitute a smaller airplane with a 143 seats, well, you would have an over-sale in that situation. The flight crew part, Mike, I'm sure we have those circumstances. But we work very hard to avoid displacing our customers. We have the ability to add an extra pilot on the airplane in the cockpit, an extra flight attendant. You want to -- that was David's specific question, you want to address that? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, David. The industry just in general has needs for unexpected crew movements every day. So there's weather, there's mechanicals, there's diversions. So that need is going to exist and it always has. And generally speaking, you know, I bet you, we have a lot of customers that when have an opportunity to take a flight an hour or two later and be compensated for, they like that. We haven't had issues historically about dealing with our flight crews. We usually know that well in advance. We can talk to our customers as they're getting up into the gate area and seeing whether or not they're amenable to taking a different flight. And I would say that 99% of the time they are. Robert E. Jordan - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hey, David. This is Bob. Let me just add two quick things. The denied boarding rate is really small. That happens to about 0.1 -- less, actually less than 0.1% of our customers. So it's a very small number. Now if you're caught up in that, that's no fun but it's a very small number that are denied boarding to start with. But about 80% of those are actually from the revenue management practice of overbooking or overselling. So that's what we're going to stop and so the vast majority of denied boardings will go away because the vast majority of the overbookings are going to go away. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Man, I am sorry to say my question's already been answered so I'm going to let you guys off easy today. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, actually you worked me really hard already. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Mary. Good talking to you. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Thank you. Operator : All right. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Tom. We appreciate your time today. If you guys have any follow-up questions, we can always be reached at 214-792-4847 or questions through our media portal at swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Have a great afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today. We appreciate your participation.",

Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Operator : Welcome to the Southwest Airlines' Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. Joining the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van De Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and other members of senior management. Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectation and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. This call will begin with prepared remarks from management, after which the lines will be open for questions. The company asks that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that many questions as possible may be accommodated. At this time, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call over to Mr. Kelly for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2017 conference call. I am very pleased to report another very strong quarter. Record EPS and that is despite higher labor contract costs since 2016 and also somewhat higher fuel prices. We had strong cash flow. We completed our 2016 share repurchase authorization. I was also pleased to see growth in average fares for the first time in about two years. And despite some drag from our reservation system conversion, we had a solid unit revenue performance of increase of 1.5%, which was right in line with our expectations. Without the res system conversion, it would have been closer to a 2.5% growth on 5.1% capacity growth, a very solid revenue performance with corrective actions planned before year-end on some of our res system issues. Our third quarter outlook is in line with second quarter, the year-ago comps, taking those into consideration. The new reservation system penalty is a little bit more in the third quarter, the July 4, holiday timing softens the third quarter performance. And the sequential comp second quarter is harder with the full Easter benefit showing up in the second quarter. Net all that out and up 1% year-over-year is what we would expect, what you all should expect, relative to the trends from the second quarter. Our cost forecast for the year is higher than we last reported. I'm not real happy about that. We're certainly not satisfied with that. We'll be working hard during the second half of this year to rein it back into our original 2017 plan. I was very pleased with the second quarter cost performance and can at least confirm that trend-wise we'll see our unit costs pressure year-over-year begin to ease here in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. Tammy will explain further, but I did want to offer some commentary on our capacity forecast. It's being updated today for the full year 2017. We have a large number of airplane deliveries scheduled for this year. If you will note in the press release, it's 71. 18 of those are pre-owned airplanes. They go through an extensive conversion process to match the Southwest livery and convert to our maintenance configuration. So we conservatively planned for the completion of that prior to committing those airplanes into revenue service. And our tech ops folks are doing a fantastic job. And what we're finding here in 2017 is the aircraft are being delivered earlier than we had planned. We have put those early deliveries into revenue service this year, in essence, as a spare. And that's driven our cancellations down, and therefore, our ASM production higher, all compared to our forecast. And that's all as compared to a 3.5% annual forecast. So knowing that for the second half of the year, we've updated our forecast. And we've also decided to implement some scheduled flying with some of this available aircraft soon. And that will be for flying beginning in the fourth quarter. We expect the incremental capacity to be profit-accretive, of course, or we wouldn't do it. The fourth quarter will still result in very modest year-over-year capacity growth somewhere in the 1% to 2% range. And as of now, we aren't expecting any change to the rough 2018 estimates that we provided last quarter and then updated today. The highlight for this year and for this quarter was our new reservation system. I am very proud of our people, the job that they did in designing and building and testing and deploying this new technology. It was literally a flawless deployment. We discovered some design issues, if you will. And as I said, I expect those to be remedied quickly. Next, I'm my very proud of all the front-line employees along with all of our training folks, they worked exceptionally hard to learn and use a totally-new system. It has been very hard work, but they have made it look easy to our customers. So again, my hat is off to them. So aside from what I would describe as normal break-in issues that one would expect from a system effort that's this massive, it is all we expected it to be. We'll work hard to hit our $200 million run rate of incremental annual revenues by the end of next year. And that does not include fixing the problems that we discussed that affect the second and third quarter. We achieved another important second quarter milestone with the completion of the new international concourse at Fort Lauderdale, and then the launch of the new international flights from Fort Lauderdale. And that included a new destination on our route network, which was Grand Cayman. We opened Cincinnati in the quarter to a very warm welcome from the community. We're off to a great start there. And we are in the final lap this quarter preparing for the launch of the 737 MAX 8 on October 1 along with the retirement of our Classic fleets \u2013 or fleet, rather, in late September. So I do want to thank all our people again for a very strong performance, congratulate them on a superb quarter that earned them profit sharing of $202 million. And with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tammy Romo, to take us through the quarterly financials. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hi. Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. Our employees did a great job again this quarter providing their legendary customer service. And I'd like to thank them for that and congratulate them on a great quarter. Our second quarter profits were a strong $746 million and excluding special items, $748 million. And our earnings per share, excluding special items was a record performance. Margins were very healthy and our operating margin exceeded 21%. Our balance sheet, cash flows and liquidity remained strong, and I am delighted with our recent upgrade to A3 by Moody's. We're committed to our investment-grade ratings and as always, the prudent management of our capital structure. Overall, I'm very pleased with the second quarter and would like to congratulate our employees on the $202 million in profit sharing. On the revenue side, our second quarter passenger and operating revenues hit an all-time quarterly high. Our unit revenues have turned positive and were up 1.5% year-over-year. This performance was right in line with our guidance, even with the greater-than-expected impact from the new reservation system cutover. The RASM pressure from the reservation system transition was less than a point year-over-year for second quarter. Adjusting for this unfavorable impact, our RASM performance looks to be at least on par with the industry, which is notable considering our very significant outperformance in second quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, the RASM pressure from the transition to our new reservation system is temporary. And these items are relatively minor, considering the significance of the technology efforts. And we expect to have the necessary technology and procedural fixes in place by the end of this year. For our third quarter, we expect year-over-year RASM growth to be approximately 1%, which includes about one point of unfavorable impact from the reservation system cutover. We do not expect a significant impact beyond third quarter. Our third quarter revenue trends were also impacted by the timing of the July 4 holiday, as well as last year's outage, which roughly offset each other on a unit basis. Adjusting for the timing of July 4, sequential trends look to be in line with, if not slightly ahead of, historical trends. We had nice growth again in other revenues for second quarter, which increased 7.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased Rapid Rewards. And we expect another year-over-year increase in other revenues in third quarter. So turning to cost now, our second quarter cost performance was slightly better than expected. Similar to first quarter, fuel prices were higher in the second quarter this year as compared with the same period last year. We saw fuel efficiency gains in the quarter, with the capacity increase outpacing the increase in gallons used. This is meaningful and is being driven by fleet modernization and other fuel savings initiatives. Based on market prices last Friday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.95 to $2 per gallon range, which is below a year ago. Third quarter fuel cost estimate includes $0.35 in hedging losses, which is comparable to the amount of hedging loss we currently expect for fourth quarter. With fuel hedge losses significantly below where they were last year and the second half of this year, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon in fourth quarter to also decrease year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, unit costs came in a little better than we expected, primarily due to lower advertising spend. We were up 5.3% for the quarter, largely due to higher wage rates from labor contracts as well as technology implementation cost associated with the new reservation system and our operational initiatives. We expect these cost pressures to ease as we go through the remainder of the year. Based on current trends, we expect third quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the 2% to 3% range year over year. Last year's amendments to our labor agreements are driving 3.5 points of the year-over-year increase, which is being partially offset by a slowing technology spend and continued benefits from the retirements of the Classics. And we continue to expect fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to be comparable with year-ago levels. Considering our modest capacity growth plan for the fourth quarter, I am encouraged by our fourth quarter unit cost outlook, which does reflect our focus on lowering cost. And we intend to do that as well as we move into 2018. We ended the quarter with our industry-leading investment-grade balance sheet as strong as ever. Our year-to-date free cash flow of $1.4 billion was solid and was driven by strong operating cash flow and manageable CapEx levels. Our expectation for CapEx in 2017 remains at roughly $2.3 billion, with $1.4 billion related to aircraft spend. During the second quarter, our board of directors approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend as well as a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. For the first half of this year, we have returned $1.1 billion in buybacks and dividends to our shareholders. $400 million of these returns were from the accelerated share repurchase program that was launched during second quarter and completed this month, which completed the previous $2 billion buyback authorization. And in June, we paid our 163rd consecutive dividend, which totaled $76 million. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is now just over 30%. And as ever, preserving our strong balance sheet and cash flows remains a priority for us. Turning now to fleet and capacity, all said, there hasn't been really any significant changes to our fleet or capacity plans. We ended the second quarter with 735 aircraft in our fleet. And as a result of the Classic retirements, we expect our fleet to decline to 688 at the end of third quarter. We'll grow our fleet to 707 aircraft by year-end 2017, and we still expect to be at 750 aircraft at year-end 2018. With respect to our Classic fleet, we had 69 Classic aircraft in our fleet at the end of the second quarter and are down to 67 today. We intend to retire all 67, of course, by the end of this quarter. As we continue to manage through the retirement of these aircrafts, we purchased two of our 300s previously under operating lease during second quarter. And the lease termination cost associated with this was approximately $8 million, which was recorded as a special item. At the end of second quarter, we had 21 Classics under operating leases remaining in our fleet. And we expect to record a charge of approximately $60 million as a special item related to these aircrafts, which is primarily related to the lease payments due as of the date we cease use of the Classics. There could be additional charges recorded in third quarter associated with certain lease return requirements that may need to be performed on the aircraft prior to their return to the lessor, but we don't expect these charges to be significant. And just as a reminder, these charges were contemplated in the estimated $200 million even improvement from accelerating the Classics from 2021 to 2017. Turning to our order book, we made just some tweaks to the order book. And in short, we added four pre-owned 700s. And with the acquisition of these aircrafts, we deferred our four remaining 737-800 options and converted them to four MAX 8 options, two in 2021 and two in 2022. And we're gearing up for the MAX 8 and we're looking forward to that and expect even more fuel efficiency gains from that aircraft. We'll get our first MAX delivery in August, and we will have 10 by the end of third quarter. The MAX will enter service on October 1, immediately following our Classic fleet retirement. With this fleet plan, capacity growth in third quarter 2017 is expected to be approximately 4% to 5% and fourth quarter growth in the 1% to 2% range year over year. And our expectations for 2018 year-over-year capacity growth continue to be less than 4% for the first half of the year and less than 2016's 5.7% for the full year. Our domestic network remained strong, and our international flying is maturing nicely. And we continue to grow our network prudently and profitably. So to close, I'll congratulate our employees again on a great quarter. Our reservation system is up and running. And our employees are doing an outstanding job navigating the new system. Service began in June to Grand Cayman and Cincinnati, and we are excited about our upcoming service to Turks and Caicos in November. The international terminal at Fort Lauderdale opened earlier this month, which supports our current international flying as well as future growth opportunities. The MAX 8 is almost here. And we will be retiring the remaining Classics by the end of this quarter, which is by far the most aircraft we've ever retired in a single quarter in our history. These are very significant accomplishments. And our people, once again, demonstrated their warrior spirit and that they are the best in the industry with their unmatched hospitality. And with that, Tom, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is actually Connor in for Helane. So we appreciate the color on 2018 capacity growth, but can you help break it down a little bit further? I know that the schedules aren't final, but how much of your growth should we expect to be in the domestic market versus international overall? Thanks. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Tammy, I believe that the split is roughly with what is published right now. With the updated forecast for the improved completion factor, I believe it's roughly 3.1 points coming from domestic and the balance coming from... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: For this year. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: For 2017. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: For this year. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, for the full year, and the balance coming from international. So the domestic mix is still near 3%. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, it's still near 3%. That's correct. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: That doesn't include the additional flights that I mentioned that we are planning to publish soon. And those are domestic flights as well. So that might boost that by a 1/10 or 2, but it'll be obviously \u2013 it will be very modest since it's just one (22:46) quarter. Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just to be clear, that's for 2018 or 2017? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I beg your pardon. So that was 2017. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, that's 2017. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Was your question 2018? Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, sorry. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, we haven't shared that yet. And quite frankly, we haven't made our final choices yet. So you'll have to stay tuned on that one. We opened the schedule today at least through April. Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. In terms of the reservation system and the cost tailwind that we should associate for that for 2018, so what was the \u2013 was there any cost associated with the reservation system in the second quarter of this year? And what was it again for the third quarter? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: On the reservation system cost, I'll give you kind of a breakdown. As we kind of move through the year here, we \u2013 third quarter, as we get into the third quarter, we do expect that to ease. And we've got just from the technology for the full year, it's going to net to something relatively small. But for the \u2013 I'm pulling here for the second quarter alone. If you'll just bear with me one second, we'll pull that for you. If you'll bear with be we'll get back to you with the number for the second quarter. Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. So look, forgive me because I'm just an equity analyst. But can we talk a little bit more about precisely what's happening with the rollout of the reservation system, why that's negatively impacting RASM and why you think that's only going to be contained in the third quarter? I'd be appreciative. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We have a handful of items. I would just identify in my mind three that are very isolated. And the new system for these three items does not work like the old system. So \u2013 and Southwest is unique. So one of the items that's pretty easy to visualize is we have a product called Business Select that we sell that allows the customers to have the first 15 boarding positions and their choice of seats once they get on the airplane. There is a corollary product that we call Upgraded Boarding for any seat that have not been sold yet as Business Select, our customer service agents can sell those seats for a price at the gate. So this is when you're there for departure. And that particular product is not \u2013 it is not working as we would intend it to work, and we are not getting the Upgraded Boarding revenue. It's not a huge amount of money, but it's an example that we're describing. So you think about just the vast majority of our customers, they are \u2013 the new system is working very, very well with no real change in our \u2013 in the new system versus the old system. There are a couple of items like that. The more material one is a little harder to explain, and it's with our groups. So we do have a product for 10 or more people that are traveling. And a lot of that in the back office is manual. So the new system is a little bit harder and more cumbersome, I think is probably the easiest way for \u2013 as a lay person to describe it. And the (27:20), but the issue is when we have groups that cancel, it is harder for our people to identify those cancellations go in and reopen that seat inventory and then resell those seats. And that's where we're seeing a revenue penalty, if you will, from the groups. So there's a couple \u2013 and that's the biggest one. So there's a couple of items like that. There's \u2013 fixes are already designed. The construction is underway. And now, it's just a matter of when will they be done. And obviously, Tammy and I are hopeful that they'll be done yesterday. But those \u2013 and we intend \u2013 we expected that we would have some things like that, but those were a couple that we just didn't anticipate. In fairness, we have some things that are positives too that went into effect with the new system. But these negatives are offsetting the positives right now. So it has nothing to do with the elegance of the system, whether it meets our needs, whether it will be able to realize our benefits. These are just a couple of one-off items that we found, that we'll fix and we'll get behind us. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate going a little bit more in depth there. And then I wanted to talk to your comments as well as you're getting the aircraft in the fleet a little bit faster this year. It sounds like you're still talking about 4% capacity growth in the front half of 2018. Does that mean you're finding incremental opportunities for capacity next year, given that that growth was most likely slated for earlier in the year in 2018? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: If I understand your question, I think what we are about to publish in terms of additional flights, they are flights that we have already planned for next year and we're simply accelerating them to 2018, if that's the answer to your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, it was a convoluted way to ask it... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: In other words, if you fast forward to the end of 2018, we're not doing anything right now that would end up more trips, in theory at least, than what we were contemplating before. That's just what the caveat that we're only published through April and we are still working on what we want to do for the balance of 2018. But I think conceptually, all we're doing with the additional fourth quarter flying is we're accelerating already planned adds into the fourth quarter. The other color commentary I would offer up there is it's a little painful for us here in the fourth quarter to ground the Classics. And in order to continue with funding of some additional flying that's already committed for end 2017, we're having to make cuts in areas that we don't like. So this is an opportunity for us to restore some of those more painful cuts. And as I mentioned before, these are kind of no-brainer opportunities for us where we're very confident that there'll be profit added to the quarter. They were planned additions in the first place. We just found the airplane time available and been able to accelerate it. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate it. Thank you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: And if I could jump in here, Gary, just to add a little color on the first question. The technology year-over-year impact in the second quarter was in the $10 million to $15 million range. And for the first half of the year, we had pretty heavy spending as well in the first quarter. And that was probably another, call it, $35 million. So for the first half of the year, we've \u2013 the impact is about $50 million, and which will be a headwind as we \u2013 or rather a tailwind as we move into the second half. As we move into the second half of the year, we'll see the \u2013 basically the year-over-year comparisons essentially go away. So we'll be back in line for the most part in third quarter and fourth quarter with respect to our technology spend. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: There's kind of a punch list along those lines. The technology spend may be a little bit more complicated to think about the future. But we have ramped up our training. There's overtime hours associated with that. So that's a cost bubble, if you will, during this second quarter for our operations team. We've staffed up significantly in our call centers to handle the cutover. And we have committed plans for that, through attrition, for that head count to trend back down. So that will be somewhat of a cost bubble not just to the second quarter. So that will ease back over time. And then there is some amount \u2013 there's tens of millions \u2013 call it $10-ish million that is related to simply having payment for two reservation systems simultaneously. It's a smaller number, but that will cease as well. So \u2013 there's a fair number of things there. The hard part about the technology is we have a lot of work to do in our technology group. And the question then becomes, well, do we replace that technology spend that was for that new reservation system and put that money to something else? So that's not what we want to do. We haven't set our budget yet for 2018 for that. But there's clearly a handful of items here that will result in some material improvement, I think, going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Since we're on the topic \u2013 on the cost side, it looks like you're kind of exiting the year at a flat year-over-year rate. Any reason we should believe that cost could be down year-over-year next year on the... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: We \u2013 yes, you're exactly right, Savi. As we get to the fourth quarter, we'll be trending towards flat year-over-year due to a number of tailwinds. And as we look forward to 2018, I do think we have opportunities to improve our cost. We're working through our 2018 plan now, and that certainly would be the goal. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: That'd be the objective, yes. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: But I'd like to come back and give guidance later this year. But that's certainly what our desire is, is to bring unit cost down year-over-year in 2018, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And by the way, Savi, just looking at the market as we get past our fuel hedge losses, we'll have relative to the market this year, we'll have nice comparisons on the fuel side as well. So as we end the year here and move into next year, I'm feeling pretty good about our cost position. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I am too. I think these are all qualitative thoughts. In fairness to both of us, we just haven't put a pencil to it yet. We haven't worked through all of our wants and needs for 2018, but the Classics are gone. Some of these res \u2013 transition costs won't be repeated. And just the benefits of having the MAX in the fleet and just overall fleet modernization, and we'll grow a little more next year than we're growing this year. And that's beneficial on the cost side too. So I think those are all reasonable assumptions at this point. And just give us another quarter or so to finalize our plans, and we can give you better guidance for next year. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. And just somewhat tied to that, we're hearing on several \u2013 a couple of different calls that there are kind of these certain areas, aggressive pricing going on even in the walk-up fares in certain hubs. And I'm just kind of curious if you're seeing that. And two, if you're going to see cost lower next year, is there as much pressure to kind of push through pricing increase? I think that was (36:16) this year just because of the level of cost increases. But how do you think about kind of pricing out there? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well again, I would kind of go back to my earlier comments, which I feel like the second quarter was a very strong revenue performance, I think that the third quarter outlook is more of the same. It is very competitive. It's competitive now. It's been competitive for years, as we all know. So there's a lot of action. There's adds, there's subtracts. And despite all of that, we had a really strong second quarter. And I think again, we'll have a strong third quarter. So implicit in that is stable is my report. Now, are we seeing fare activity along the lines that you described? Absolutely. But one statistic I think that you all would enjoy that I did jot down for this quarter as an example is, for the first time in a while, the majority of our markets are showing unit revenue gains year over year. And for a while, it was a minority of the markets over the past year or so, to my recollection. You can see the granular strength market-by-market. There are some markets that are under pressure. But overall net-net, we're seeing more strength than we are weakness. And the other thing that is encouraging is we purposefully slowed our growth for 2017. We purposefully reduced the mix of markets under development in the system in 2017. So we're now down to what is a more normal level of about 3% to 4%. And just looking at the quote, developing markets as an entity, they showed very nice same-store year-over-year gains in the second quarter, which again is very encouraging. So we want to be as aggressive as we dare with our capacity. But overall, we want to be cautious and we want to make sure that we're hitting our revenue and our profit targets. As to next year and the way to think about it, we'll start the year, I'm sure, with a goal to have positive unit revenue performance in 2018. But I know our leadership team would agree that the overall goal is to sustain or grow our margins. So I think we've got an opportunity to do that. We've already talked about the all other than fuel cost outlook for 2018, which right now we're all kind of excited about that. But in addition to that, we're going to have a fuel price decline next year. So it's set up very well. We're not intending to grow aggressively at all next year, although the percentage increase will be higher than 2017. But we want to manage it in such a way that we drive unit revenue gains and strong margins. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's all very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much. Tammy, just given some of the tweaks to the fleet, can you just update us on where you see CapEx in 2018? I think at the Investor Day, the charts that you had showed aircraft CapEx down about $600 million or $700 million. Is that still what you guys are expecting? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, even with the tweaks, we're still expecting our total CapEx to be \u2013 we're hoping to bend it down from the $2.3 billion level, but I would say at/or below the $2.3 billion is our goal for next year. So I think at least with the fleet changes that we have, we'll be within that guidance. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I mean, I guess that's a lot different than what the message was from Investor Day. Have there been changes on the aircraft side? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Changes from the aircraft side? No, other than the \u2013 so the goal is to bend down from the $2.3 billion, which is in line, that's total CapEx. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Yeah, maybe I can just follow up offline because aircraft and non-aircraft should be down pretty substantially next year. I guess, is that not what you're saying? I mean instead of bending down, it should be down quite a bit. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, we, as I said earlier, we are working through our plan next year for CapEx. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Take it down in 2019 for sure off of the top-line there. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's down, yeah. So we'll be down next year, but we're finalizing all of the non-aircraft spend. So technology of course is a piece of that. So we're finalizing what that is going to be for next year. And with this year, just to give the magnitude of that, that's $250 million. And facilities, that's running about $300 million this year. So we're working through all those details for our plan next year, with our goal to bring the total CapEx spend down. But I just don't have a number to give you today, Joe. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then Gary, I think back on the fourth quarter call, you kind of talked about loyalty program disclosures and how you guys wanted to communicate the value that you get from selling miles to Chase. Can you just provide us with an update as to what you think a proper set of disclosures would look like or a better way to kind of communicate to the market, how good of a business that is for you? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Tammy, you want to answer that. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'd be happy to. Well, I can answer your question. That is a really good business for us. Our Rapid Rewards revenue, other revenue was up significantly in the quarter, double digits year over year. So it continues to be a strong contributor. In terms of the disclosure, understand your desire there for more disclosures. And we are looking at that, and we're working to provide additional disclosures. But we need to determine what information would be most useful to all of our investors while protecting our competitive strategy as well as honoring our contractual commitments. So we're working to strike the right balance there. And in terms of when you might expect us to potentially expand our disclosures, we're looking to do that in the first quarter of next year with the New Year. And keep in mind too, we've got a new revenue standard coming out. So we're looking at all of that together. And that's kind of the timeline we're looking at in terms of providing the disclosures along the lines that I know you're looking for. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. So it's probably safe to assume you guys are looking like a high-single digit capacity growth rate in 2018. But look beyond that, you guys are only growing your fleet count by about 2.5% in 2019, even if you exercise the options that you have in the fleet plan right now. And I know we're a long way away and things are going to change, but Gary, I was kind of hoping maybe you'd kind of put your thumb in the air a little bit and talk about that at a high level. Should we think about maybe 2018 as sort of a transition year, a little bit of catch-up growth from the artificially-depressed growth this year, and that you get back to like GDP-ish-like number in 2019 on capacity, with the caveat things can change? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. No thumbs in the air, sorry. So I think we'll first focus on our 2018. We're not seriously contemplating any changes to our fleet plan for 2019. And we'll see how things develop for this year and next year. And then we'll set our plans for 2019 accordingly. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I think that's fair. Thanks, I appreciate that. And then let me talk about Hawaii for a second. You're going to announce that if and when you announce it, I'm not asking you to talk about that at all. But would it be fair to assume that you have to solve for some complicated maybe product-related things that make the decision a little more difficult, like say catering or seat assignments or overwater IFE or something like that, before you consider competing there? And \u2013 or do you think just like brands and low fares are alone are simply enough to sort of have a Southwest Effect in the traditional sense in that market? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, we've got operational challenges that would certainly be unique for us with Hawaii, and I think that's the bigger issue for us. Our experience so far on \u2013 the gist of your question is we haven't ran into that in other markets. So it's pretty much the Southwest you know and love. It's very successful everywhere we fly. And recognizing that we want to be humble about this and recognizing that Hawaii may be different, we may want to evaluate that. But we haven't made any decisions obviously about Hawaii at this point. And my belief is that when we do, if \u2013 it's not \u2013 if we were going to go, it's when we go. We think it's an important strategic offering that Southwest needs to make at an editorial point. But when we do that, it's my belief that it will be off-the-shelf Southwest Airlines. The IFE, we're investing in IFE to at least our onboard WiFi and television product to improve that performance this year. And Tom, off the top of my head, I don't recall whether that provides for overwater or not. It's obviously satellite-delivered service. It will \u2013 so I think, Hunter, we'll have that, and we think that's important also. But our snack offerings, we do tailor to the distance of the segment. It seems to work fine. It's not \u2013 I get a lot of customer feedback. I don't typically get a lot of feedback on food offerings, although we do get some. So it's \u2013 I would think that it will fit within the way our provisioning works today. Whether we want to be something that is a little more unique for Hawaii, we haven't \u2013 you can tell we haven't discussed that yet, but it won't be anything that's dramatically different. Our catering is pretty straightforward, and it is snack-oriented, doesn't require refrigeration. We manage the shelf life carefully, all of those kinds of things. And I would think that Hawaii would fit right into that just fine. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the time. Just a question for you on the Classics, as you look to retire those going into the fourth quarter or end of the third quarter. So can you maybe just provide some color on the impact that has to unit revenues? Do Classics tend to have higher RASM? I'm just trying to make sure I'm aware of any dilutive potential as we move forward, or the opposite, if that makes sense, Gary? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. I think your \u2013 on the revenue side of things, it's not so much that it's the Classic per se, it's just the gauge. So we're \u2013 we'll definitely be back to Hunter's previous question. A lot of the growth that's anticipated in 2018 is gauge-related. So you're swapping out a 137 or a 143-seater for a 175-seater. I think in most cases, we're getting some 700s. So yes, there'll be \u2013 you've seen that up-gauging since 2013. So that will continue. Tammy, I don't know if you're ready to give a gauge and a gauge guidance for next year, but there'll be some gauge inflation, if you will. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, I would expect. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: On the cost side \u2013 I think you know all that and I think Tammy, it's also fair to say on the gauge, to the extent that there is some revenue dilution, that's all factored into your $200 million EBIT number through 2020. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's correct. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Sorry but on the Classic, the RASM is I guess typically higher than on some of these other aircraft, just given the smaller gauge? Is that fair? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No. Well, again, it is the seats. So we have \u2013 the 700s are the same seats as the Classics. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So that \u2013 I probably didn't make that clear. And the 700s are the majority of our fleet. So for the most part, I would assume about 80% of the Classics will be replaced with a higher-gauge aircraft, tail for tail. I am putting my thumb in the air on that one. I think that's kind of a rough justice on that one. But the \u2013 so if the \u2013 what Mike was just saying is that there's also a shorter-haul orientation for the Classics. However, we'll still replace short-haul flight with a 700. So I don't think there's any change per se, because you're replacing a Classic with a light seated aircraft. I think that's all the same. But obviously if we're trading it out for a higher gauge, well then yes, there'll be some RASM effect of that, but there ought to be a \u2013 the way to think about it is, yes, the RASM might show lower, but the costs are being lower still. So you're going to get an operating income benefit, tail by tail by trading a Classic for an 800, under the assumption that we schedule the 800 in a way that it's full. And we've done a pretty good job of that. My hat's off to our folks. We had another record load factor in the second quarter. So that's all good stuff related to the Classics. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, helpful. And then just a quick one, Tammy or Gary, you made some comments about the rating upgrade at Moody's, et cetera. I guess, you're now A rated. Is that sort of the goal longer term? I mean to me, it seems like that might be maybe too strong of a position on the leverage side, but just want to hear your thoughts. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, we're trying to strike the right balance there. We do want to maintain our investment-grade rating, but at the same time manage our capital structure. In terms of our kind of leverage goals over the longer term, and historically these have ebbed and flowed over the years, but just sort of as a longer-term goal, maintaining a leverage somewhere in the low 30% range feels about right. So certainly, don't intend to drive our leverage down really below where we are today. But somewhere in the low to mid-30% range feels about right. So \u2013 but we've always had a strong balance sheet as one of our top priority. So that certainly isn't going to change. But we certainly want to continue to optimize our capital structure as well. So I think we're balancing all of that pretty well. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You didn't necessarily ask for the philosophy, but I'll just pile on to what Tammy said. The \u2013 I agree with your \u2013 the direction of your question, which is corporate finance theory would suggest there's a more optical rating, let's say, BBB, maybe BBB+. But we want \u2013 we'd like to have some cushion because there will be bad times and our strong balance sheet has served us very well. You know the 46-year history and there is no airline that comes remotely close. And the balance sheet strength is one of those shock absorbers that has really helped us in bad times. The philosophical point to argue here is we are still going to manage the company under the assumption that there will be very difficult times again. I've heard comments about things are different now. Maybe, but we're going to make sure that Southwest is very well positioned to weather the storm. And so we're delighted to have that upgrade and still want to have adequate leverage. But we're not trying to fine tune this \u2013 we're not trying to hit the BBB. We're trying to be better than that, so that we can absorb the blow if times get bad and we don't fall into junk. And over the past 15 years, there's been risk of that at times. And bad things happen there, and we don't want that to happen. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. We'll take our last question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask a couple of quick ones for Tammy. Could you maybe comment for a moment or just expand somewhat around the higher unit cost in the back half of the year. Sort of what specific buckets would be driving those when we think about your prior guidance? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. So I was having a little bit difficult time hearing you there, Jack. But I think what your question was, is, as we move through the year, how should we expect our comparisons to \u2013 how should the second half comparisons be relative to the first half of the year? So, we do have a number of tailwinds and just to recap those for you. We have of course as we get to the fourth quarter, we'll lapse the impact of the labor contracts. So that's about a one to two-point tailwind as we move into the second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we have about call it $50 million in technology costs that represent about a point. So we'll see some \u2013 our cost pressures ease in that area and then... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Why is it higher than our previous? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, we had heavy spend again last year, and also just some onetime costs associated with our reservation system. So we have about a one point tailwind as we move into the second half. And then the benefits from just our Classic fleet is about another point. And then as Gary was mentioning earlier kind of wrapped up in other is just some of the training costs and so forth that will ease as we move into the fourth quarter. So that's how we end up, and fourth quarter with kind of flat unit cost comparison. So it's coming from a number of different areas. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I wasn't able to hear his question. I'll just repeat it, Jack. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'm sorry. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You were coming in very faint. His question was our previous guidance was one thing, and now it's higher. What's driving the increase in the guidance? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, I apologize. I did hear your question differently. What's driving our guidance from where we were previously is we have, I guess, just at a high level kind of going back to the technology, it's really related to that. We were seeing our overall technology spend hasn't really changed dramatically. But we are seeing a shift of that spend to more of an operating mix than what we had anticipated in our forecast. So the overall spend isn't really changing, but we are seeing a little more operating expense pressure than what we had planned for. So I'm going \u2013 and so really the flip of that is in our CapEx. So, I do think we'll come in a little bit lower than our $2.3 billion CapEx for the year. And offset there is on our operating costs. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, okay. Thank you for that. And sorry if I was coming through faint on my question. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, I apologize. You were very faint, but it's good to hear your voice. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Likewise. And then just my follow-up question on the $103 million hedge asset that you called out in the press release for FY 2018 through FY 2020, how much of that hedge asset is specifically related to FY 2018? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Of 2018, it's about $40 million. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, okay. Thank you very much. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're very welcome. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Presentation: Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the media representatives who are on our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion of the call for the news media. Tom, if you will give them some instructions to queue up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin with our first question. Our first question comes from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, I was just wondering what's your thoughts on from what you've seen in Washington D.C. around the air traffic control debate. Are you optimistic that that is proceeding as you'd hoped and that there might be progress made on that before the end of the year? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, let me answer it this way. I am delighted that we have the focus from the administration. I'm grateful for that. I'm delighted that we have the focus from Chairman Shuster. And we have wonderful alignment between the commercial airlines, Chairman Shuster and the administration. There is just a lot of controversy about the change, and I'd be the first to recognize that. There is good momentum. Congressman Sam Graves from Missouri signed on to the legislation. And I thought that that was a very significant move. And he is very concerned about private aircraft operators. Chairman Shuster, I should say, was able to convince him along with the industry that there were protections in the proposed bill there. So I remain hopeful that we can get something done. But, Conor, I have to admit that there is just a lot, a lot of work to do. And I don't know that there is a vote scheduled in the House yet, which means that they may not have all the votes that they feel like they need. The Senate, of course, is far behind where the House is, and there is a lot of work left to be done there. But we need to make progress in the House first to have any hope of getting something done. My concern overall is that if we don't accelerate the pace, that we will face a real capacity crisis in the air. Because it takes longer and longer to operate flight segments, so the air space is getting less and less efficient. Our air traffic controllers do a wonderful job of keeping the airplanes safe, but they do that by slowing things down more and more and more. And of course, for air traffic controllers to use the old technology that they're forced to use is very, very cumbersome. And they're understaffed. So there is just a lot of things that must change if our country is to continue to grow air travel and people want to fly. So I think that's \u2013 we need to keep our eye on the ball and worry less about some of the other politicking that's going on. And so hopefully, we will make some progress this year. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Oh, good afternoon. Gary, I was reading about this new plane. I think it's called the 737 MAX. You might have heard of it. I think Tammy said you were... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I have. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Excellent. I think Tammy said you were due to get 10 in the third quarter. What are you expecting in the fourth quarter and kind of tallied to that, have you sort of picked up anything from those who have already started operating the MAX? And given some of the issues in the engine supply chain, which do seem to be spreading to leap a little bit, do you have confidence that none of those are going to slip into 2018? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We will have 10 on October 1 when we start service. And then we'll end the year with 14. Mike, do you want to talk about the airplane and what you've heard from Boeing and other operators around the world? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: That airplane has been just really from the day that they designed it until the day that they delivered it, they have been on their timeline. And it appears to be a better airplane, more efficient airplane today than what we thought we were buying years ago. I haven't heard of any issues, or Boeing has not made me aware of any issues that caused me any concern with respect to our delivery schedule or in-service dates or the operation of those airplanes. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And Mike is our Chief Operating Officer. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Yeah, okay. That's very clear. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And we have time for one final question \u2013 I'm sorry, we do have the next question from Nicole Raz with Las Vegas Review-Journal. Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Hi, thank you for taking my call. How does Las Vegas' performance stack up this quarter compared to previous quarters and do you have any visions for expansion plans or where does Las Vegas fall in terms of I don't know near-term future plans? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, you know how important Las Vegas is to Southwest. And it's just another opportunity to thank you on \u2013 for representing Las Vegas for all the support we get from your communities. We have a great relationship with the community. We get tremendous support from the airport. We're the largest airline in terms of customers at Las Vegas and have been for many, many years. And it's a very stable market. I think I will characterize it as very strong. To your benefit, in the community, there is a lot of competition there, and we welcome that. So we certainly hold our own with competition, but Las Vegas will always be an important part of our plans. And we don't have any plans to do anything significantly different here in the near-term. But again we will always keep an eye on Las Vegas and its needs. And Las Vegas, I believe today is about the third largest operating point that we have in our system. And it, often times, it vies for second and sometimes first. So right now, it's over 200 daily departures, which for us is very, very large. Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal: And how did Las Vegas in terms of you said third operating point, how do I compare it to first quarter? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: A stable environment, so we're not adding a lot of flights, we're not subtracting a lot of flights, it's very stable, the business is very strong. And I think Las Vegas is enjoying another boom here. So we're happy to be a part of that. Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Thank you. I'm sorry, just two more questions. You were talking a lot about gauge inflation and fleet changes, having a hard time following that. Are we going to see any type of upgrades or new airplanes here in Las Vegas? What does that actually mean? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You will. And gauge just means it's an industry euphemism. It just means the number of seats on an aircraft model. Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So 700 and before we get to the MAX, the 700 is the smaller narrow body airplane and the 800 is the larger one. And in our configuration which is all coach, we put 153 seats on the 700. So when we talk about gauge, if we trade a route for an 800 instead of a 700, we would say we're up-gauging that market. Since you asked, another industry euphemism is density. So we put 175 seats on an 800. Our competitors, who have less pitch in the seats, could put, I don't know, like 190 seats? 189, so 14 more seats. So that is the same gauge of the airplane, but they've chosen to jam more seats in there. So we don't put the same number of seats in as many of our competitors do, because we want you to have a comfortable flight experience. But that's all that means and the rule of thumb in the airline business is the bigger the gauge, the lower the cost per seat and it puts us in a position as long as we can fill the airplane up with customers, that we'll have a lower cost and can keep your fares lower. So that's the importance of considering the gauge. You just can't take that to an extreme. You'd be flying 400-seat airplanes by that logic and of course only filling up 100 of them, and you'd go out of business really soon. Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Thank you for clarifying. So the timeline that we'll see that bigger gauge here, the 800, is that you said by the end of this year? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You've got them now. So out of a fleet of, I'll just call it, 700 airplanes, we probably have, I don't know, Mike, 150 airplanes that are the larger gauge 800s. And we fly a lot of those 800s in and out of Las Vegas. So you're already getting those. What we were \u2013 the previous question was on the next generation from Boeing. So it's the new version of the 800. It's called the MAX 8. So the gauge is the same. The seat density is the same as our 800 and we'll have 14 of those by the end of this year. It has a different engine. It has different performance characteristics. It's lower fuel burn. It's 40% quieter. So the odds of you getting one of those in Las Vegas because it's \u2013 we'll only have 14, are rather low, but I'm sure you'll get them. So we don't dedicate airplanes to a city. They fly all over the country. And so it will be a little bit random as to whether or not you see one. But one of these days, I am sure you will and I hope you get to ride on it, because it's going to be a really nice ride. Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal: Thank you very, very much. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have time for one final question. It does come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Hi. Mike, I just wanted to ask real quick, you talked about the MAX being more efficient now than when you ordered it. Is that just on fuel burn? And can you talk about how that may have changed and if that's what you were referring to? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, Mary, that's what we were talking about. When we were beginning to talk with Boeing about the airplane, it was a PowerPoint airplane. And they were talking about having its fuel burn improvement in the 10% to 11% range. And I think it's closer to 14% now. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : And has it been at that range for a while now, the 14%? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, it has. As they got further along into the design of the airplane, further along into the wing structure and the gear structure and the engines all coming together, they've solidified that and their flight tests have seemed to prove all that out. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks a lot, Tom. If you all have any other follow-up questions, of course, the communications group is standing by, 214-792-4847, or you can always find us at swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP Operator : Welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom, and welcome, everyone to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman and CEO; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of senior management. Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, which excludes special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results. We will begin here shortly with Gary providing an overview of our performance, followed by Tammy providing a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and current outlook. Following Tammy's remarks, all of our call participants will be available to answer your questions. And we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many question as possible. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. I want to start out with a shout out to all the Southwest people. We've had really unprecedented storm challenges, fires, the Las Vegas situation and I don't know that we've ever had a 60-day period in our history where we had to deal with so many different external events like that. They did a phenomenal job. And of course, I'm very proud of the response that Southwest had for the communities that we serve. And we're continuing to keep all the folks that are impacted in our thoughts and prayers and continuing to do the best we can to support them in their recovery efforts. So despite all of these challenges, it was a very strong quarter, and fourth quarter looks better. 2018 is also set up very well for unit revenue growth as well as margin expansion. I found the third quarter and fourth quarter a bit challenging to interpret and there were a lot of moving parts. We have a new reservation system. New labor contracts went into effect in the intervening 12 months. Hurricanes, earthquakes, we grounded the 737-300 fleet. And the year-ago comps have some items in them as well. And I would say that that applies to both revenues as well as costs. So Tammy is going to cover it in more detail, and I suspect that we'll be redundant on some of these points, but hopefully that will be helpful to you. So first of all, I just want to start out on revenues. Unit revenues were down 0.5 percentage point in the quarter, and there's no real surprise there. Without the $100 million hurricane impact, RASM would have been flat. As also what is not new news is that the new reservation system created a temporary onetime drag of roughly 0.5 point, a little bit more than that for several reasons : school calendars, our new reservation system, just the number of aircraft deliveries that we were accumulating in August. We extended our summer schedule farther than we typically do, and that proved to be a drag as well of roughly 0.5 point. That's not something that I anticipate we would repeat next year. So you put all those things together and take those things into account, and it was a good result. The third quarter was more challenging on yields than the second quarter was. But, again, overall a very solid quarter and I think we're positioned well now for the fourth quarter. The yield environment in the fourth quarter appears to be improved compared to where we were in third. The onetime effect of the new res system should not be repeated in the fourth quarter. The storms, the fires, the Las Vegas situation are certainly improved from where we were in third quarter, although there are still some recovery taking place, especially in Las Vegas. We have a more aggressive schedule per aircraft because of the classic fleet grounding. That does present some drag, although overall, we'll definitely have a cost benefit of the grounding of the classics. But all in, we're expecting positive unit revenue comparisons versus a year ago and a sequential improvement to third quarter as well. And I'll just repeat again, we'll be watching Houston and Florida and Las Vegas recoveries very closely. Our revenue outlook for 2018 is stable as well. Our goal, which I believe is realistic, is positive unit revenue growth for 2018 compared to 2017. Our new reservation system synergies of $200 million for 2018 is intact. So a solid revenue performance and a solid revenue outlook. On the unit cost front ex-fuel and profit sharing, we were up 3.3%. There's no surprise there, maybe perhaps some good news compared to what we were expecting, but overall actually a very good performance. Costs were down across the board on a unit basis, except for the salaries category. So just remembering that the new labor contracts went into effect after last year's third quarter with snap-ups. That was 3.6%, meaning that unit costs would have been down, except for the new labor contracts. Of course, those are real costs, and they are continuing. But more important for your analysis is the onetime effect of the storms on the third quarter and that was 2%. So if you take those two things into account, a very, very good cost performance for third. As for the fourth quarter, we expect unit cost ex-fuel and profit sharing to be in the range of flat to up 1.5%. That's somewhat higher than our previous expectations, and I would say it's mostly timing. There is the remaining, a still, a year-over-year effect in the fourth quarter of roughly 0.5 point and a little bit more from the new labor contracts. We'll realize a nice benefit, as I mentioned earlier, from the grounding of the classics fleet. But our schedule is not fully optimized because we are trying to maintain as many flights with a fewer number of aircraft in the fleet. So I would expect that that would be more optimized by the time we get into the second half of next year. So a solid cost performance and a very solid cost outlook. Overall through the first nine months, now almost 10 months in the year, I'm very pleased we have successfully deployed our new reservation system. We've successfully launched international flying out of a new terminal in Fort Lauderdale. We retired 67 airplanes from the classic fleet in the third quarter, which was a huge effort and done very successfully. And, of course, we launched the MAX on October 1. Our growth is very manageable, both for this year and for next year. There's only about 3% of our system that we define under development, and I'm very comfortable with that. It's a very competitive environment out there, as everyone knows. But I would also say that that, at least for us, is very manageable, and especially considering the diverse and very solid and very strong route system that we have. The economy and travel demand look very solid. And again, I'll just repeat, we're continuing to watch carefully Houston, Florida, Las Vegas and I should also mention Puerto Rico. The energy price outlook for the near term and for next year looks pretty favorable. I'm very happy with the hedging position that we have built for the next several years. No change in our growth plans, no change in our fleet plans. We're just getting to work on Hawaii as you all now know, and we'll have more to report on that in the first quarter. So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Tammy Romo. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. And I would like to start off by congratulating Mr. Kelly on his well-deserved The Wings Club's Distinguished Achievement Award last week. And I'd also like to start out by thanking all of our employees for their incredible efforts during the quarter. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been impacted by the hurricanes and earthquakes, the Las Vegas community and those impacted by the fires in California. And while our third quarter operations were certainly impacted by the unprecedented number of natural disasters, we were very pleased to report strong third quarter profit of $503 million. Excluding special items largely related to the retirement of the classic fleet, our third quarter profits were a strong $528 million [with healthy margins. My congratulations to our Employees for their resilience and hard work this quarter to produce these strong results] (10:28-10:40) which earned them $127 million in profit sharing. Jumping right into revenues, our operating revenues were a strong $5.3 billion, despite the significant impact from the hurricane. Our third quarter RASM decreased 0.5% year-over-year, which was in line with our most recent guidance. This included a revenue headwind from the implementation of our new reservation system of less than 1 point. The minor issues from the reservation system that caused the revenue impact in the third quarter have been remedied, and we don't expect an unfavorable impact here in the fourth quarter. Third quarter started off with a positive year-over-year RASM growth in July. However, August and September were both impacted by the significant weather events and the competitive fare environment impacting close-in yields. As we noted in the earnings release, the hurricanes, the natural disasters caused approximately 5,000 flight cancellations in third quarter, which negatively impacted our third quarter revenue by $100 million. Nearly 15% of our system ASMs touch Houston and the other stations in Texas that were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And about 25% of our system ASMs touch Florida and other states nearby as well as near international destinations that were impacted by Hurricane Irma. However, both our Houston and Florida operations and employees are resilient, and the impacted stations and passenger demand have rebounded quite well. All things considered, including our difficult year-over-year comparisons due to our strong industry outperformance over the last few years, we are very pleased with the overall resiliency of our revenue performance. Our freight revenues were also solid, and third quarter other revenues increased approximately 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by the continued success of our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. And although the fare environment remains competitive here in October, it does appear to be stabilizing. October passenger revenue yields are currently trending up nicely year-over-year, which is an improvement from August and September year-over-year yields. And I'll just point out that November and December are expected to have more challenging year-over-year unit revenue comparisons due to the boost in travel demand and yields last year, particularly between the holiday periods. And while the December holidays fall similarly year-over-year, we are monitoring whether we'll see any negative impact from school holidays beginning later in the month, which may postpone more travel into January, but it's a little too early to tell. That said, overall travel demand for the fourth quarter is solid, and we are very pleased with our current outlook for positive year-over-year unit revenue in fourth quarter. Based on current bookings and revenue trends so far in October, we currently expect fourth quarter RASM to be up slightly to up 1.5% year-over-year. We also expect both freight revenue and other revenues to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Turning now to cost. Our third quarter cost performance was within our expectations. Our third quarter economic fuel price per gallon was $2, which was at the lower end of our guidance. The retirement of the classic fleet and other ongoing fleet modernization initiatives drove a nearly 2% improvement in fuel efficiency year-over-year. Since our last call, crude prices, as you know, are up. And for fourth quarter, we are estimating approximately $2.10 per gallon based on market prices last Friday and our current fourth quarter hedge position. This fourth quarter fuel cost estimate includes a $0.25 per gallon hedging loss. At the end of this year, our fuel hedging losses will burn off, providing meaningful tailwinds in 2018. All of our hedges in 2018 and beyond are call options and call spreads with no floor risk. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit cost trends improved sequentially, as expected, with the continued benefits from the retirement of the classics and the wind-down of costs associated with the implementation of our reservation system. With the retirement of the classics, we recorded two special items during the quarter. As expected, we had a $63 million aircraft grounding charge related to the remaining lease payment. We also recorded a $20 million lease termination charge related to the acquisition of four of our classic aircraft previously under operating leases. And as a quick reminder, these charges were contemplated in the estimated $200 million EBIT improvement that we've been communicating from accelerating the classic retirements from 2021 to 2017. Excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, our third quarter unit cost increased 3.3% year-over-year which came in at the lower end of our guidance. The year-over-year increase was driven by the hurricanes and wage rates from labor contracts, partially offset by classic retirement benefits. Looking to fourth quarter, we continue to expect our unit cost inflation to ease considerably as compared with the first three quarters of the year. As we've stated before, this is due to the cost benefits associated with the retirement of the classic fleet and the lapse of the step up in wage rates from the labor agreements. Based on current trends, we now expect fourth quarter year-over-year CASM excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to be in the range of flat to up 1.5% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this increase include a shift in advertising spend and incremental costs associated with technology investments, including ETOPS authorization in preparation for our Hawaii service. And adjusted for the hurricane and our investment in ETOPS, our full year CASM is in line with where we were in July on our last conference call. Our investment-grade balance sheet remains very strong and continues to differentiate us in the airline industry. We are very proud of our recent rating agency upgrade from S&P to BBB+ in August, which is on the heels of our upgrade to A3 from Moody's in June. Our liquidity is strong with cash and short-term investments at quarter end of $3 billion. And our cash flows remain very healthy with operating cash flow of $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30. Our CapEx guidance for 2017 is unchanged at $2.3 billion, which allows for healthy returns for our shareholders. And in August, we repurchased $300 million of common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, leaving $1.7 billion remaining under our current $2 billion authorization. Thus far in 2017, we have returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases is approximately 30%. And our goal remains to keep leverage in the low to mid-30% range. And moving on to fleet, I am very proud of the many employees that were involved in the management of retiring our classic fleet. We started the year with 87 classics and retired 69 in third quarter alone as planned. That brought us to 687 aircraft at the end of the third quarter after the delivery of 20 (sic) [21] new and used aircraft during the quarter. We are thrilled to introduce the MAX 8 into our network. We have 10 of them in our fleet currently and we'll have 14 by the end of this year. We continue to expect to end this year with 707 total aircraft and our fleet plans remain unchanged in 2018 with 750 aircraft. On the capacity front, we continue to expect fourth quarter capacity to increase in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. And our 2018 capacity plans remain unchanged with expected ASM growth of less than 5.7% year-over-year. We expect first half 2018 ASM growth to be in the 3% to 4% range as we noted in our earnings release. And as a recap, our return on invested capital for the last 12 months is a strong 26.8%, and 2017 is shaping up to be another just really stellar year. I am excited about 2018, including our future plans to serve Hawaii. And I want to thank our employees again for their hard work and perseverance in a challenging quarter and for all that they do on the front lines each and every day, and congratulate them on these great results again. And with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hello. Mr. Keay? Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Sorry. Can you hear me? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I can hear you now. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Sorry about that. Okay, thanks. So 2018 costs, Gary, you said you feel good about the RASM outlook for 2018. That's great. I would imagine you guys are enough through the budget process at this point to give us a preliminary look. Do you feel like having the expense behind you with the PSS cutover that we should start thinking about CASM ex fuel next year as being down? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I do feel really good about the cost outlook for 2018. Tammy, would you like to go through that? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: I would be delighted to. So yes, Hunter, we're still finalizing our 2018 plan. So I'm not prepared to provide guidance today. We plan to cover that on our January call. However, I'd be happy to provide you some thoughts and goals that we have for 2018. On the cost front, we're still working through our multi-year plan, including how we want to invest in technology and other areas of the business. We have some wonderful tailwinds in 2018 related to benefits and depreciation, maintenance and aircraft rentals from the classic retirement and onetime cost associated with Lone Star as well as significant tailwinds for fuel with our hedging losses burning off this year. And with the classic retirement and launch of the MAX 8, we should have a meaningful fuel efficiency improvement in 2018. As we move through our planning process for next year, some headwinds have also materialized, including costs such as landing fees. And as our -700 aircraft age, of course, we'll have some increasing maintenance cost there as well, and just other typical inflationary cost pressures. Netting all of this out and considering that we will still be transitioning through the classic retirement as far as the network schedule goes, I think CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, would be a reasonable goal for us versus 2017. Of course, as always, we will continue to look for ways to manage those costs down, but I think down year-over-year cost per available seat mile excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items would be a stretch based on what we know today, which is of course a little more than what we knew at the time of our last call. Overall, I am quite pleased with our early outlook for 2018. We are, as you \u2013 on the revenue front too as well, we're working hard to realize the benefits from our investments in our new reservation system. And we'll continue to be diligent on the cost front. And then kind of back to fuel, with the tailwinds I mentioned there and our goal to grow RASM, I do think that we are well positioned to expand our margins next year. And certainly costs are a big part of that story. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Tammy. And, Gary, on the positive RASM comment that you made, what gives you the confidence about that? And how much of that has to do with your view on industry conditions versus some of the Southwest specific stuff? And on the Southwest specific stuff, is it a load factors play? Is it a yield play? What are sort of the components of that that give you the confidence to put that out there at this point in time? Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Very fair questions, because nobody has a crystal ball. I think it is just recapping some of my opening comments. It's our view that the economy will continue to be stable. It's our view that the travel demand will continue to be very strong. And then, of course, we're overlaying that what is the competitive supply of seats that are out there. And we're looking at the things that we have in the pipeline to bring it online next year. Of course, you all are well aware of our one res synergies that we've been talking about for some time. And then just looking at current trends, there's a lot of strength throughout the Southwest system. And I'm very happy with the progress that our development markets are showing. Andrew Watterson and his team have been very active in pruning out some of the non-performers in our system. And off late of course, you're familiar that we eliminated flying to Varadero and Santa Clara. I was unhappy doing that, but it's clearly the right thing to do. So we'll continue to be active in managing the network. At the same time, I want to let them take some risk and be aggressive, but overall, it feels like we're set up very well. Next year is fun in the sense that compared to gosh, the last five years, it's just more stable. There just aren't as many moving parts. We're not retiring fleets. We're not introducing new res systems. We're not opening up brand-new international terminals. The big-ticket item right now is just working on Hawaii, and I think that that will be less ambitious than what some of these other things have been. But my hats off to our folks for managing this well, and I think they'll continue to manage it with better tools next year. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Just to clarify, Tammy, on your comments on the CASM outlook or framework for next year, at least on my line it sort of cut out when you were talking about the expectation. I think you said you're not expecting it to be \u2013 I think you said down year-over-year will be a stretch. But I didn't hear it, I guess, your exact comments on sort of your outlook for 2018 CASM ex. Could you just maybe go over that again a little bit? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure, Jack. Sure, and I'd be happy to. Just on our CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, as I said, getting down might be a stretch. But I do think that a flat CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items is a reasonable goal versus 2017. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I just wanted to make sure that that was out there great. And then just kind of... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Absolutely. And then just sort of as my follow-up question, going back to the $200 million in pre-tax incremental profitability from the new reservation system next year, could you help us think through sort of the cadence of how that will flow through the P&L as we move through the year? Is that going to be sort of evenly distributed throughout 2018? Or is it more second half weighted? And then how should we think about that incremental profitability coming from revenue or cost? Just trying to think through how that's going to show up in the P&L next year. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure, Jack. Well, first of all, as we've indicated, this year, we're really focused on just implementing the \u2013 getting the new reservation system in. And as you know, that's gone very well. We actually have a couple of releases coming up here this year. And so we remain very pleased with the progress of the rollout that we would like to get a little further down the road before we provide additional breakdown of the $200 million EBIT. So we'll come back more later and fill in some of the blanks. But certainly with the ramp-up, I think it's reasonable to assume you'll see more of that as we get to more in the back half. But in terms of breaking it down any further for you, we'll come back as we finalize our plan and provide that likely on our January call. That's our current plan at the moment. But everything is going well, we're pleased with the progress and that's where we sit today. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And one quick housekeeping item if I could squeeze this one in. Could you provide us with the hedge asset or liability as things stand today for 2019 if that's possible? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, absolutely. For 2019, it is just about $50 million. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. I'm a little mad at Tammy. She beat me to the punch on the Wings Club Award, coming from somebody, Gary, that's also known you for over 25 years, I sincerely hope that you accept my congratulations as well. Very, very cool. A question on Hawaii, and I know you're not ready to discuss routes and schedules and all that. But when I think about the time of day that most flights depart the West Coast to the number of time zones you cross, the implied arrival time back in California or on the West Coast, if you did maybe a 60-minute, 65-minute turn. I don't know. I sketched out several single aircraft patterns. And in most of the scenarios, it looks to me like you'd have adequate time to do some interisland turns. And of course, shorter-haul flying is Southwest's bread and butter. And I know you're not going to say whether you would consider inter-island. But can you point me to anything in the work rules, the pilot duty regs, anything that would at least allow me to rule out the feasibility of running a couple of turns before you turn back to the mainland? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. There's nothing that would rule it out. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And I think now that we are public with all of this exciting topic, that is an item of interest that customers in Hawaii have, that the state of Hawaii has. And obviously it's something that Andrew and his team are intrigued with as well. Step one, of course, is getting from California to Hawaii, but it is absolutely, everything you said is right, and it has been down our priority list, but we'll have serious consideration for that. And who knows, even if we don't do that initially, it's something that we would obviously continue to consider over time. But I think everybody understands where we are. This is very high profile work, and we just can't keep it a secret. So we're letting the world know early on that we're working on it. And there are a lot of questions to be answered, when being one of the major questions that we just don't have those answers yet. But like I indicated in my earlier remarks, it feels like first quarter we might be in a position where we're prepared to reveal details there. But, no, there's nothing that would prohibit us from doing that that we know of at this time. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate the sanity check. Second, as it relates to pricing, I just want to confirm that the older system put some limits on your ability to price match by channel. But the new system does give you more flexibility. So if an ultra low-cost competitor has a single daily fight at, I don't know, noon, you can match on your 12 :20 departure, but you don't need to match at 9 in the morning or 5 in the afternoon. Is my understanding of the new system correct? And if so, is this what you're broadly doing or not? And I'm not asking about future pricing, just what's in the market right now. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, first of all, our folks have done an amazing job in managing revenues in what is a very sophisticated art and science with not the best tools. So I don't think it's a fair characterization to say that we could not do certain things. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: It is I think more accurate to say that we have far better tools now to do things along the lines that you're describing than what we've had in the past. Whether that will show up as a material difference in the future, I'd rather not comment on. But it is absolutely accurate to admit that we have much better up-to-date state of the art tools today than what we've been using. And what we've been trying to share is that it's a really good airline that has produced really good results, and we're just going to have better tools going forward. So clearly, that is one of the tools that we'll want to make good use of. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. And sorry again to miss you last week, Gary. Congrats. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the international side, I was just wondering if you can provide an update on how that expansion has gone, and just any opportunity to be a bit more aggressive in growing in those regions? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Savi, and Tom and Tammy can pitch in here too. It's gone very well. Clearly those markets have similarities to domestic markets in the sense that they struggle a bit when we start. And then over time if we're managing it well, then they develop very nicely. So we have a little bit over 3% of our available seat miles trans-border. I just have a few notes here handy. The capacity increase in the third quarter year-over-year was just under 19%, and the revenues far outpaced that. So we're seeing, which is an indication again to my point to you that these markets are, they're in the development phase, but they are developing very nicely. Some of it is what Andrew has been doing, which is trimming out some of the underperforming routes, which aren't very many of them. But our RASM was up on a stage length and gauge adjusted basis, almost 8% year-over-year, so feeling really good about that. Load factors are really strong, I think. So the net answer to your question is, absolutely, we have a lot of opportunities to grow there. We have a wealth of opportunities all over the place. So we have domestic opportunities. Everyone knows about Hawaii. We've got international. So we'll try to be as coy as we can about giving our competitors advance notice of where we intend to go next. But we're struggling with our capacity here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter to be able to grow for the obvious reasons with the classic fleet retirement. So we'll have to see where Hawaii settles in. And the nice thing is, again we've got plenty of opportunities. If we're constrained in a certain region, then we've got more than ample opportunities to grow somewhere else. We are following through with our announcement to open up service to Turks and Caicos, and that will be next month. So we've done a full assessment after Hurricane Irma there, and all systems are go. But that Turks and Caicos is the last city that you know of, or destination that you know of that we're adding, but we have plenty more to choose from. But admittedly right now, we're looking at Hawaii and what it's going to take to start that service. And clearly, that will be our next priority. If we have room to add some more international destinations next year, that would be fantastic. We do want to continue to support our growth in Houston and Fort Lauderdale in particular. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: If I might follow up on that, Gary, so next year, I think your previous comments have been that you'd be accelerating domestic growth and focusing on that, and letting international digest itself. Is that still the case? What level do you think is going to see acceleration? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Savi, I think that's very fair, and that is what we have done thus far with the schedules that we produced. We're about to publish the schedule next month. Andrew, that would take us through August, I believe? Andrew Watterson - Southwest Airlines Co.: Beginning of August. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Beginning of August for next year. So at least with what you've seen through the first half of the year, yes, that's been more of a domestic focus. And we haven't opened anything beyond Turks and Caicos. So we'll, as per usual, we'll continue to wait until the very last minute to commit, but certainly, that's been \u2013 that has been our focus for the first half of the year and may very well prove to be \u2013 we may very well not add any more new destinations. Hawaii is the thing for us to answer right now. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Hey. Thanks. Can you talk about the next maybe two, three, four IT systems that are in the pipeline, what's the most material contribution from those would be? Now that you've got the big res migrated, what are your next two or three priorities? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I would say that the reservation system, by the way, is still a huge focus for us. We've got a major release coming out next month. But let me let Tom take you through that. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Okay. Well, so let's talk about res for a second. So in mid-November, we'll be releasing release 2.5, which really cleans up all the operational revenue leakage stuff that we've been dealing with. So that's going great. All that kind of stuff is going well. I think the next set of big investments are really not on the commercial side. I think we have a very good set of capabilities there now. It's going to be more on the operational side. We have work going on right now replacing our maintenance systems, our aircraft maintenance portfolio is under development right now. Flight planning and scheduling is being upgraded and replaced as well as crewing systems. So those are the three big platforms. If you think about an airline, I think you get all four of those, res, crewing, maintenance and flight operations. That is the foundation. And we're building this. In fact, I would tell you that if we were not planning to grow, what we have today is really pretty darn solid. It's pretty good. But if you do intend to grow, which we do, we need to have a foundation that can grow with us. That's what we're doing. And Mike and I are really closely linked on what does the operation look like with those new capabilities. So those are the priorities right now. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And the only thing I'd add is that in terms of the benefits, we have opportunities to continue with our fleet modernization efforts that have a cost benefit, and then also, these systems that Tom was describing, it's Mike's goal to create an opportunity for our operations to become more and more and more efficient. So we've changed a lot over the last 15 years. We have much higher load factors than we did 1.5 decades ago. We have more connecting passengers. The bags per passenger, Mike, I think are about the same, but it's just the volumes are greater. And some of our operational systems struggle to keep up with that, very much in line with Tom's point. So, there will be an investment, but I'm also very hopeful that there will be tangible financial benefits that will flow from these operating system enhancements. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. And may be just to dig in a little bit further there with respect to flight planning and scheduling. Can you speak to when that would go live? And maybe next year or three quarters from now, like how will that improve your ability to be tactical within the month or within the quarter on capacity changes? Could you just contrast the flexibility that you'll have in the future relative to what you're dealing with right now? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, it's early, but what I would tell you is unlike the one res, we truly went in two big releases. Now we have kind of minor release going in. But it was kind of \u2013 let me call it big bang, but it was kind of a big bang. Unlike one res, I think what you're going to see with things like crewing systems and flight planning, flight control is going to be more of an incremental function being added in over time. It's just too early days, but it's going to transcend or really transpire over several years. We're fairly well into it, but I'm not sure I can really give you a more definitive answer than that. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Duane, I don't remember, Tom, that we have any major operational functionality that's deploying next year maybe aside from the maintenance record keeping system... Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, we have our tech ops system, we'll be deploying late, late in the year. But we've already deployed some really good recovery tools. It's called The Baker IROPS tools. And we're going to continue to put functionality into that and that's pretty meaningful for us. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So I think, again, to summarize the \u2013 for the near term, we'll be continuing to implement follow-on releases of the reservation system. And obviously we want to finish what we started there. And there is tremendous value to be earned from that. That will need to continue to be a priority. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for your time. Mostly I wanted to ask if you've seen legacy carriers, United and American in particular, deploy their basic economy product and scale in your markets? And if so, whether you believe you are gaining market share in those markets as a result? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I get the implications. We can kind of argue this from both ways in theory. Is it good for us? Is it bad for us? So far, I don't sense that we can tell one way or the other. It's certainly not hurting us. Whether it's helping us, I don't know at the margin. In terms of our brand, I can assure you it is helping us. We have a lot of fans and we're grateful for them. So they love Southwest Airlines, and we're trying to be their most loved airline. But here in the meantime, I'm just giving you an honest answer. I don't sense that it's moving the needle one way or the other. Do you agree, Tammy? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: I completely agree. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But I love... Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Sorry, go ahead. Sorry, Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Tom, do we have another question? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, Gary, just want to come back to the pricing comments that you guys made \u2013 it might have been Tammy, I'm sorry. But, you did say that it appears the fares are improving in your markets from August into September and into the fall. Do you think that's just a function of improving demand or is it capacity dynamics that are more impacting your network to maybe others? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, from month to month, I just don't know that the markets are that dynamic. So I think it's just pricing, to be blunt. I think pricing is very dynamic and hard as just speaking as one carrier, it's impossible for us to predict what behaviors we'll have from our competitors. And then as a consequence of that, what moves we'll need to make to react. So, overall, it just feels like the yield environment is better. Well, it doesn't feel like it is. It is better in October than it was during the third quarter, which was a wild ride, I think as everybody knows. Second quarter was pretty darn good. And then all of a sudden, things got off the rails a little bit. I think the point I was trying to make in my earlier comments is that we're fine with that. We have a very low cost structure. We have a very diverse route system. We're continuing to strengthen it with flights where we need them, and we're trimming out where we don't. And we can handle all this. So, we'll have ups and downs to a degree. But in the grand scheme of things, our revenue production all year has been quite good, softer in some periods than others. Right now, we're on a bit of an upswing. And just to make sure you caught what I said earlier, we seasonally \u2013 sequentially rather, we are seeing improvement in the fourth quarter so far compared to where we were in the third quarter. And then obviously, Tammy and I made the point several times that the year-over-year comps are so far looking pretty good. The holiday travel for November look strong. The December is a little far out and a little less definitive right now how it will compare. As usual, we always struggle a little bit with how holiday travel will occur on the calendar. Whether it's December, January, that flips a little bit. I think the calendar is pretty close. I think it's just \u2013 well, obviously, just one day different than last year. But right now, well again, we're looking for an improved yield environment and good compares versus a year ago. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I appreciate the thorough response. And I think one of your smaller competitors out in California called out some weakness specifically in that market. So that could have gotten investors worked up a little bit. But, I guess, the longer-term issue or question I have for you... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I can comment on that if that's a question. As we look regionally, there's no question that where there is vigorous fare activity, there's more of an impact on us. And Tammy shared that earlier this morning on a media interview; Chicago, Houston, even Denver to some degree. California is very competitive, but it performed very well in the third quarter, pretty close to in line with the system average. But I certainly wouldn't say that we're seeing weakness in California, but it just harkens back to my earlier comment, we're the number one airline in California. We have a very strong fan base there. We're continuing to add flights to meet the needs of our customers in those markets and grow where we can. And those results look very good, particularly considering that we've added quite a bit of capacity out there off late. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think that's very helpful for your investor base. I'm sorry, I'm going to sneak one more, and I very rarely violate that rule. But you are going to be in an asset position on your hedge book. So does that change your philosophy at all on pricing when you think about fares in the 2018? I know you want to have up unit revenues, but... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. We're going to go crazy. No, I think as we have said for years, we want to be disciplined about how we manage our growth and how we set expectations for revenue production in our markets. And our goal for next year is positive unit revenue production. Even knowing that our CASM will be down next year, assuming that fuel prices behave themselves. Tammy has already mentioned that her goal for all the rest of the cost structure ex profit sharing, all that stuff that you list is flat. So yeah, we want to continue to boost our unit revenues and maintain that discipline. We're very leveraged to fuel prices. I don't have to tell you all that. I'm happy with our hedge position. But I think it would be foolish to behave in such a way that doesn't recognize \u2013 that wouldn't recognize that fuel could change course and all of a sudden it create problems. So that will be our goal. And as I said earlier, I think that is a realistic goal. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Good afternoon. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Gary or Tammy, can you provide a bit more color on what you're including in your 4q RASM guide? Are you reflecting demand hedge from places like Houston and Vegas? Is there a calendar hit in there? I think, Gary, you mentioned something about elongated schedules. Is that something that's hitting the results? Just some color would be great. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, all those things are in there. And the only cautionary note that I offered up, I'll let Tammy speak for herself, is that Las Vegas isn't back to a 100%. I'm assuming that it will be here at some point. Houston and Florida looked to me like they're still lagging a bit. I think our guys are pretty happy with where we are there. But I think it's just the recognition that those situations are a little volatile. And in Puerto Rico in particular, I was asked earlier this morning, what our prediction about Puerto Rico is a year from now. I just don't know. I don't know when that will fully recover. But with those caveats, I don't think we are implying that we're expecting miracles in any of these markets whatsoever. If anything, maybe we've got a little bit of a cautious approach out there. But, Tammy, anything you want to add? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: No. I think we've covered all the highlights for fourth quarter. And I agree, we've got our best estimates incorporated in the guidance that we've given you here today. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And the drag on the schedule from the retirement of the classics, I don't see any upside there. I think that will continue to be a bit of a drag because there are simply later or earlier flights in the day from what people really want, and we're very familiar with that. But my point is that as we tighten up the schedule, the objective will be to tighten up the schedule as time goes by and we get more aircraft deliveries. Our target would be to see some improvement there. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just those headwinds that you're talking about, Gary, Tammy, is that like a point or so? Can you put maybe a finer point on it? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. 0.5 point on that particular item. On Las Vegas, Houston or Florida, Tammy, I don't know if you have a number in mind or not. I didn't. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. If I \u2013 quantifying just for on the revenue side, the Las Vegas, and it probably drove the California fires in that, maybe that was probably a $10 million to $15 million impact, so again, not too significant. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just the second question. In terms of the capacity side of things, what's the latest thinking on growth in the back half of next year, and the factors that will drive that range? Obviously, you guys have done a good job with providing the first half, but any more color will be great. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: As we said earlier, Rajeev, we're going to update as we publish our schedules. So we're not prepared to give you specific guidance today on the second half of next year. So I think I'll just stick to what we've already shared. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, there's no change. I think Hawaii may be \u2013 whatever happens with Hawaii may impact our available seat miles, but there is no change in the airplanes. We have schedules out there. Tammy said three to four for the first half for next year. Obviously, if we're less than 5.7, it means we would grow more than that in the second half. So you should absolutely expect that, but. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: But that's really driven by the classic fleet retirement. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Right, exactly. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: So, nothing really new there. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. That's right. That's just year-over-year comps. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Gary, Tammy, thank you much. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question, and it comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, just a quick one here. Gary, at this point, do you have the capability, I know Tom talked about the systems and maybe Tom can chime in as well, just the capability to do red eyes? And if you don't, if you can't do red eye flying now, is that something that you would want to be able to do at the time that you started Hawaii, or do you feel like you could serve those markets without flying red eyes? Andrew Watterson - Southwest Airlines Co.: We are going forward, and I want Mike to, if he has something he wants to add to this, to chime in. We are going forward with our Hawaii work without red eyes. Right now, I'll just speak for Gary right now, but we don't really desire to fly red eyes right now. So just for our style of operation, it would complicate things. I'm assuming, Mike, both Mikes, Michael and Mike, that at some point we will want that capability. Tom went through the list of technology priorities earlier, and it's just down the list. So we can do Hawaii without the red eyes. Whether we feel strongly that there's a revenue benefit from having the red eyes, I don't think we've judged that yet. And then Mike Van de Ven, of course, has to deal with all the complication of doing that. But Mike, do you have anything you want to add? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, I don't really have anything else to add. We've got those capabilities identified that we'd like. We've got them a little bit lower on our priority list. And it does introduce some operational complexity in terms of the crew scheduling and the maintenance programs that we all want to work through and just make sure that we have that capability being delivered in the year we really want it. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So as you can tell, Mike Linenberg, it's not a priority for us. And it's not a factor, in our view, with our Hawaii service. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, very good. That's all I needed to know. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom. And welcome to the media members of our call on our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A. Tom, if you'll just give them some instructions on how to queue up to ask questions. Operator : Yes, ma'am. And thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Gary, I just wanted to know kind of where things stand in Washington, D.C. with all the different discussions that are going on up there, specifically with air traffic control reform. Is there sort of a path forward to see they get some momentum? Are you waiting on your people in D.C. to kind of take that up? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Conor, the House has been attempting all month as I recall to get the FAA reauthorization to the House floor. And so far, they have not done that. And I think that that is just an indication that perhaps all the votes aren't lined up yet. Now the focus, as we know, has turned to tax reform. And so I don't know how that might or might not interfere with this effort. But overall, I've been encouraged this year, and it is the fact that the administration is behind exactly what we would like to do is a plus. The House leadership I think is behind the reform effort that members of the FAA, our leaders of the FAA have actually come out in support of the effort. So it's not done yet, but I don't know any more about it than that. I don't know if there is a desire to have a vote this year or not. I hope there is. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Good morning. Gary, you mentioned a couple times Vegas is still not 100% from where it was. Can you add any color to that? I mean is this business, leisure, short-haul, long-haul, all across the board, anything regional? Can you give any more color on that front? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I think it's pretty straightforward. I think it is obviously a huge vacation destination. It is traffic related, and I think totally understandable. So we're very close with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau and the entire community there. And we'll all work together. I, quite frankly, I'd be surprised if we weren't back to 100% by the end of this quarter, if not before. But it's not... Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Are you making any adjustments? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, adjustments in terms of our flight schedule? Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Yeah, flight schedules, fares, I mean anything to maybe get people that, maybe have some. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I think in fairness, we're always making adjustments. But in terms of a major change with our flight schedule or a major change with our fares, no. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We're mainly, just making sure that everybody knows, again, working with Las Vegas that we're open for business. And I'm confident that the traffic will come back and grow. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Can you say how much the traffic is down? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'd be happy to if I knew it off the top of my head. Tammy, do you have a number in your mind? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't have the traffic number in my mind. But, as I mentioned earlier, the impact that we're expecting here in the fourth quarter is pretty minimal in the $10 million to $15 million range. And that's what we're estimating. So beyond that, I don't have the traffic numbers top of mind. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Dawn, if it were a 100%, if that were the standard, it's not that we're down by 50%, we may be down 10% or 15% something in that order of magnitude. But, I'd be surprised if we were down that much now quite frankly. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with FlightGlobal. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question about the Hawaii service. Can you talk a little bit about just the ETOPS certification and maybe Mike could chime in if he is still on the line. But how soon after getting initial ETOPS for the 737-800s where we see Boeing 737 MAX service? Thanks. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. So we have got a team of people working on our policies and procedures. The great thing is we don't have to invent them. They're out there. We just need to gather them and write them in a manner that works in our procedure manuals and then get training done. So what we've been doing is sitting around doing tabletop exercises with the FAA making sure that we have those procedures and training requirements clearly written. We're going to take that package and we will actually apply for an ETOPS certification, add it to our ops specs early next year. And then the FAA will go through their approval process. And that could take anywhere from maybe 6 to 12 months with them, just depending on their staffing and their challenges and what they need to do. So we are going to launch with the 800 there. We have that airplane today. It's ETOPS-capable. And that's our quickest path to Hawaii. And then we will begin discussing with the FAA what we need to do to have the MAX ETOPS certified. It will be our Hawaii airplane for the future for us and then the foundation for our service. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Okay. But how soon after launching Hawaii service initially? I mean, how many more months do you have to wait before you can actually get the MAX on board? Do you have an idea about that? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: How long before we can do what? Oh, how do we? Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Yeah. Before you can actually get the MAX flying to Hawaii? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, that's what we need to work with the FAA on and understand what they need to see from us in order to get that certified to do that. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Okay. Thank you. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't have an answer to that question until we get more information from the FAA. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: All right, great. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Great. Hey, Mike, I wanted to ask you how the MAX is performing. So far, you had a few issues on the initial flights. Can you talk about how it's been going since then? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, sure. Yes. We have 10 airplanes in service today, Mary. And what I've been saying is it is as advertised. So we've got a 14% fuel burn improvement as compared to the 800. We've flown over 1000 flights with it so far. We've had 152,000 customers on it. It's been through about two-thirds of our system domestically. And the reason I just \u2013 and so we haven't had any surprises or unexpected issues with that airplane. So we do have the typical newness on the airplane, a lot of first time experiences and slightly different procedures on the airplane. But it has just been performing, as I said, as advertised. I'm very excited about adding the airplane to the fleet. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Do you have any kind of a number, like a dispatch reliability number or anything like that for the MAX so far? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: They are right in line with the rest of the system, the rest of that, like our 800s, they're right in line with the 800s. Of course, as you mentioned, we did have on one of the airplanes that we launched service. We had a fairly unique maintenance issue on that airplane. It hasn't been reproduced across the global fleet. We've been working with Boeing on that; got that fixed. It's back in service, and it's performing just exactly in line with the dispatch reliability of the 800s. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Great. And if I could also ask, there was a local article yesterday about AMFA trying to or threatening to try to block Hawaii service. I wanted to see if you all would confirm, you've said in the past that there's nothing in your labor contracts that would prohibit Hawaii service. I just want to see if that's correct for that group as well? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's correct. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And that is our final question. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Tom. As always, if you have any follow-up questions or need anything, you can reach us at swamedia.com or by calling the Communications Department at (214) 792-4847. Thank you all so much. Operator : And that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for joining. Editor' s note : There was text inserted at the request of the company at the 10**:28 mark in the audio due to a technical difficulty that occurred on the call.",

My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Tom. And welcome, everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO and other members of senior management. Please note today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the Company\u2019s current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of the future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, which excludes special items, please reference this morning\u2019s press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations to non-GAAP results to GAAP results. Gary will begin with an overview of our performance, followed by Tammy with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Following Tammy\u2019s remarks, we will be available to answer questions. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan. And thanks everybody for joining our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. It was an excellent quarter all the way around, and I want to thank all of our 56,000 plus employees for an exceptional year and congratulate them on another very strong profit sharing for 2017 of $543 million and then as an addition to the $70 million tax reform bonus that we shared. After two years of modest unit revenue declines, we turned the corner in 2017, and that\u2019s despite a very competitive industry environment. Unit revenues were up in the quarter 1.9% and just under 1% for the full year. We\u2019re currently estimating 1% to 2% unit revenue growth on strong load factors and bookings for first quarter 2018, and our goal is for positive unit revenue comparisons again for this year. Better revenue management tools and techniques, enabled by our new reservation system, will help mitigate any competitive pressures for this year. I expect those benefits from the new system to begin in second quarter. Fuel prices are up over the last quarter and the futures prices become reality, we\u2019ll see some cost pressure there. But the federal tax rate reduction more than offsets that pressure. And excluding fuel profit sharing and special items, our unit cost outlook for the year is excellent with a goal of moving unit cost down slightly. Depending on fuel prices, our goal is to realize operating margin expansion for 2018. Given the tax reform, in addition to that, we would realize even greater net margin expansion. And both of those will drive stronger future cash flows. But it is worth of repeating that in addition to the margin expansion, we\u2019ve reduced our federal income tax liability at the end of 2017 by $1.4 billion, and that cash flow benefit will go through in the future years in addition to the cash flow benefit from future margin expansion. Our growth plans for 2018 are unchanged. We end the year with 750 aircraft, which recovers the classic fleet retirement in the end of -- or the third quarter last year, grows our fleet by 27 airplanes effectively over a 24 month period. So I\u2019m simply measuring year-end 2016 to the year-end 2018. Now, work is well underway to begin flying to Hawaii, so that is a focus for this year. And we announced this morning our intention to add Paine Field in Everett, Washington later this year and it will complement our presence of TTAC. Aside from the modest growth plans, our focus for 2018 will be on the basics. Unlike the past seven years, we have no major strategic initiatives that are landing in 2018, and that allows a more intense focus on running a greater line, offering outstanding customer service and controlling our cost. Capital spending will also be down this year. 2017 closed out on a very positive note. 2018 looks even better for all the reasons I just outlined. And with that very quick overview, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tammy Romo, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through the quarter. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Gary and thank you all for joining us today. I want to first thank our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another successful year, earning $543 million in profit sharing. 2017 was a year of many accomplishments and it ended with a strong fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter net income was easily a record with profits of $1.9 billion or $3.19 per share. And as we announced in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we recorded a very large tax adjustment as a result of tax reform. In reevaluating our deferred tax liabilities and assets to reflect a lower future tax rate, we reported a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter, which we called out as a special item. Excluding the tax reform adjustment and normal hedge accounting special items, fourth quarter net income was a strong $459 million or $0.77 per diluted share, up hitting ahead our first call consensus. We were proud to celebrate the passage of tax reform with our employees and a $1,000 bonus to each of them earlier this month. The employee bonus of $70 million was included in our non-GAAP results and impacted our earnings per share by $0.07. With these strong returns and another year of strong operating cash flow in 2017, we were able to make prudent investments in our business, take care of our people and return significant value to our shareholders. We\u2019re off to a great start this year. And in addition to covering more detail on our fourth quarter results, I will also provide an outlook for 2018. Starting with revenue, we ended 2017 with record fourth quarter operating revenue of $5.3 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenue of $4.7 billion. Strong demand for low fares resulted in a fourth quarter record load factor of 85%. Passenger revenues yields were slightly year-over-year but improved sequentially from third quarter as expected. And demand was strong during Thanksgiving and December holiday period. Flight revenue also performed well during the peak season, resulting in a 7.1% increase year-over-year. Our Rapid Rewards and EarlyBird revenues also were strong. In fact, our EarlyBird revenue for fourth quarter 2017 alone was approximately $100 million, which was our initial target for EarlyBird when we first called out the boarding option. Overall, we were pleased with our record fourth quarter operating revenue performance and outpaced our capacity growth to produce a RASM increase of 1.9% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We were also pleased to achieve a goal of unit revenue growth for full year 2017, albeit modest considering the unprecedented national disasters in competitive industry environment during 2017. Looking ahead to first quarter 2018, passenger revenues appear stable and travel demand and bookings are solid. And as we expect, favorable year-over-year trends in first quarter 2018 freight and other revenue. Based on these trends and our current outlook, we expect first quarter 2018 RASM to increase in the 1% to 2% year-over-year. Later this quarter, we will issue an investor update. This 8-K will reflect in a typical guidance update, as well as potential changes to our guidance as a result of accounting changes based on the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. We plan to utilize our investor updates on a quarterly basis as needed. And therefore, we will no longer report RASM guidance at our monthly traffic releases, beginning with the report of January traffic results early next month. Turning to fuel, our fourth quarter 2017 economic fuel price per gallon was $2.09, fourth quarter's $2.09 per gallon included $0.19 of fuel hedging losses. However, our fuel hedging losses are behind us now and our hedge portfolio for 2018 and beyond provides us a nice protection against cash drop prices and energy prices without the forward exposure. And it enables us to make prudent adjustments to our business in a rising fuel price environment in order to maintain our financial goals and reduce our volatility and our earnings. For 2018, we plan to early adopt an accounting standards update related to hedging where we will begin reporting fuel hedging premium expense with the fuel and oil expense above the line rather than within other gains and losses below the line on income statement. As such, we are providing our 2018 fuel price per gallon guidance, including fuel hedging premiums as shown in this morning's earnings release and we\u2019ll recast prior periods later in the first quarter as part of our 8-K update. Moving on now to our outlook, on fuel. Based on market prices and our hedging portfolio as of January 19th, for first quarter 2018, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.10 to the $2.15 range, including approximately $34 million or $0.07 per gallon in fuel hedge premium, and an approximate $0.05 per gallon hedging gain. For full year 2018, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to also be in the $2.10 to $2.15 range, including approximately $135 million or $0.06 per gallon in fuel hedge premium and $0.04 per gallon hedging gain. At current market prices, our 2018 fuel hedge positions began to produce modest gains and about $65 per barrel Brent crude with more material hedge gains hitting in at our 75 per barrel range and higher. Before I move to non-fuel cost, I want to spend a moment on fuel efficiency. As announced, we retired our remaining Classic fleet in third quarter 2017 and introduced a more fuel efficient 737 MAX 8 into our fleet in fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve continued to modernize our fleet, we have seen the nice increase and available seat miles per gallon, improving 1.3% year-over-year in fourth quarter. For 2018, we currently expect 2 to 3% improvement year-over-year in available seat miles per gallon. Excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, our fourth quarter unit cost increased 4.6% year-over-year. Putting aside the year-end items for just a second, fourth quarter unit cost trends were in line with our original expectations as we saw expected increases in salary, wages and benefits, advertising spend and shifted from third quarter and incremental technology cost that included ramping up for ETOPS in preparation for Hawaii. As disclosed in our January 2nd 8-K, we have 3.5 points of incremental cost pressure at year-end, primarily driven by the employee bonus. Based on current cost trends, we expect first quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the half of point to 1.5% range year-over-year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year increase include inflationary increases in salary, wages and benefits, which include higher cost related to an extended operating day driven by our cost of retirement and our current fleet deficit. We also expect increases in airport landing fees and rentals and maintenance. And then looking ahead to the full year 2018, we expect our CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to be in the range of flat to down 1% year-over-year, which is a very solid performance. For 2018, our largest year-over-year cost tailwind is approximately $200 million related to the Classic retirement and benefits, and depreciation, aircraft rentals and maintenance expense. We also have some offsetting headwinds in the areas of maintenance of our aging at our 700 fleet as well as airport costs. While the benefits of the Classic retirements are easier to see in depreciation and aircraft rentals, we do have a 2018 and cost of year-over-year benefit within maintenance expense. However, this classic maintenance savings is more than offset by the increased maintenance of our aging -700 fleet. I\u2019ll just make a few comments on the balance sheet and our capital deployment. We ended 2017 with arguably the strongest balance sheet in our history, and we\u2019re very proud of that. Our solid investment grade rating is intact and we are pleased with the upgrades for both Moody\u2019s and S&P during the 2017, as well as the recent positive outlook revision by Fitch. Our liquidity is strong with cash and short term investments of approximately $3.3 billion at year end. And during the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in unsecured debt and among the tighter spreads and lowest yields in Southwest\u2019s history. With this additional capital primarily to refinance existing debt, we continue to target leverage in the low to mid-30% range. Free cash flow for 2017 was the strong $1.8 billion, driven by $3.9 billion in operating cash flow and capital expenditures of $2.1 billion. Our strong cash flow and financial position allow us to return $1.9 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend. Our 2017 CapEx of $2.1 billion came in below guidance, primarily due to the shift of approximately $115 million out in 2017 and into 2018 related to one MAX 8 delivery and several non-aircraft investments that were just the shift in the spend. We are still expecting our 2018 CapEx to decrease versus 2017, and are currently estimating 2018 CapEx to be approximately $1.9 billion. Included in this total, we expect 2018 aircraft CapEx of approximately $1 billion and non-aircraft CapEx in the $900 million range, including the shifting I previously mentioned from 2017. We continue to effectively balance and manage our overall capital deployment and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows, while returning significant value to our shareholders. And with the expected future tax savings from tax reform, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our investments in our company, our people and our shareholders, including the mix of share repurchase and dividend with an overarching goal to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Moving onto fleet. Of course, fourth quarter was our first quarter flying are all Boeing, NGs and MAX aircraft on the heels of retiring the remaining Classic fleet, and actually fourth quarter was the first. And we ended 2017 with 706 aircrafts with the delivery of 19 aircrafts during fourth quarter. This is one fewer plane that expected with MAX delivery shifting into 2018. We currently have 13 MAX 8 aircrafts in our fleet. And as you saw in our January 2, 8K, we made some minor changes to our Boeing order book. We exercise 40 options for MAX 8 from orders to deliver in 2019 and 2020, deferred 23 and MAX 7 from orders to better align with our future -700 retirement and accelerated 23 MAX 8 from orders to 2021 to 2022 timeframe. We will have significant 737-700 NG retirements over the next 10 years to 15 years based on their age and this order book refresh, along with our remaining order book and option, which allow us to manage through those retirement in a measure way, while allowing flexibility for growth. Aircraft CapEx remains very manageable at approximately $1 billion per year on average for the next five years. Our 2018 fleet and capacity plans have not change and we continue to expect to end the year with 750 total aircraft base of our current firm aircraft delivery schedules. On the capacity front and in line with our previous expectations, we expect 2018 full year capacity to increase in the low 5% range year-over-year. And our third quarter 2017 of approximately 5,005 cancellations due to the national disasters, is driving roughly half of point of our full year 2018 ASM year-over-year growth. We expect or first half 2018 capacity to increase about 3% range year-over-year, as we firmed up our first half 2018 schedule. The next schedule will be published on February 15th, and that will go out through September 28th. For second half 2018, we expect our capacity to increase in the low 7% with higher year-over-year growth in fourth quarter 2018 due to the impact of last year's Classic retirement. We remain excited about our 2018 growth opportunities and we have a prudent 2018 group growth plan that produces positive year-over-year RASM for us based on our current outlook. So in closing, we had a really strong 2017 performance and 2018 is shaping up to be another solid year, which will also benefit significantly from tax reform. And as we start the year, we are well positioned for margin expansion, excluding special items. Our employees continue to deliver a reliable operation and product, and they have been proving that they are the best in the industry for the past 45 plus years. I was thrilled that we have recognized their hard work with the recent year-end tax reform bonuses, and I am very proud that they continue to be recognized for their world class hospitality. We have a bright future ahead of Southwest, and I am excited for our shareholders with the sustained momentum we have coming into 2018. So with that, Tom, I think we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We'll now begin with our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Gary, I still consider Southwest to be a point-to-point operator that just happens to have a few very large basis operations, that resemble hubs. And I am thinking this might be an outdated characterization. I am curious to the degree to which you currently schedule and revenue manage for connectivity over places like Baltimore, Nashville, Denver. How that's changed over time, particularly with the new res platform, and how you think it may evolve from here? Gary Kelly : Jamie, I think your view of Southwest is accurate. Some of the statistics that I remember well from 1980's when I joined is that, and those days and a much lower load factor, about 80% of our O&Ds flew non-stop and then the other 20% were split pretty evenly between through traffic and connections. And in the 80s and the 90s and really probably for early 2000s, we did not intentionally schedule for the convenience of connections. Since 2009, we have had some percentage of our flights that will out -- we use the term internally intentionally connect. What is interesting is -- and when I started, the annual load factor was 58%. If you go back 20 years ago, my memory serves me right it was 66% now it\u2019s 85%, 84%, 85%. So there has been a significant boost, but the non-stop versus connecting traffic hasn\u2019t moved much at all, maybe 3 or 4 percentage points. So the net result of that is we are carrying more connecting traffic. We\u2019re carrying some of it more on purpose, if you will, as opposed by accident in the old days, but there is still a very -- a real serious focus on point-to-point non-stop that\u2019s the way our network planners -- that's the philosophy and that is the strategy. I did want to use it is an opportunity though to complement them, because the load factors have gone up 20 points to 30 points over 20 year to 30 year time period. And it\u2019s not because they have converted us to a hub and spoke operation where we\u2019re more dominated by connecting traffic. It was a really accomplished by optimizing the flight schedule better and in some cases, spinning out some of the frequencies in our higher frequency markets, but not at the expense of the non-stop traffic. Andrew Watterson, our EVP over Commercial is here with us and he may remember, I don\u2019t remember off the top of my head exactly the percentage of what we think the relevant statistic would be that we intentionally connect in terms of capacity, but it\u2019s obviously Jamie not the majority of our sales. And Andrew do you recall what that statistic is. Andrew Watterson : I would call slightly above 20%. Gary Kelly : And I think that was your specific question. But that hopefully the background helped a little bit as well. Jamie Baker : Gary, thank you, that\u2019s terrific. And for a follow up, the goal to maintain positive RASM for the year, you\u2019re starting respectably at the 1% to 2% levels presumably the second quarter is no worse, probably better. But given that capacity surge and you\u2019re in the second half your annual aspiration would seem to imply that you remain in positive territory in each of the four quarters. Assuming that that\u2019s directionally accurate, what\u2019s the driving factor that really gives you the confidence in second half positive RASM on at a higher base of year-on-year capacity? Is there anything specific? Gary Kelly : I do think there are a couple of fundamental specifics. And first of all, your direction I believe is correct. Now, admittedly 1% to 2% outlook for the first quarter doesn\u2019t give us a lot of cushion for things to go sideways. So I\u2019ll admit that from the outset and that I think obviously applies even more quarters two, three, and four, we just don\u2019t have as much visibility there. But when we get to the second half of the year, we should have a much better schedule. What I am real proud of quite frankly in the fourth quarter is that we achieved pretty healthy unit revenue gains with a not so great schedule, because what has happened is we have retired, Mike, 50 airplanes in the third quarter. The fleet shrunk. We tried to maintain a scheduled presence that wasn\u2019t that different. And you have to take into account seasonality dips that we would have scheduled anyway. But in order to generate roughly the same amount applies with fewer airplanes, we had to extend the day of the airplane. And 2 times of the day that are as profitable, quite frankly. So there is a fairly significant discount to have a flight operating at 9 pm as compared to operating at 6 pm. So all that means is that we believe we\u2019ll have a security schedule in place that will yield better by the time we hit to the second half of this year. So that\u2019s point number one. And then point number two, notwithstanding the angst that I note yesterday and today about the industry, we\u2019ve got a new revenue stream in effect that\u2019s coming online this year that Tammy and our team is still pretty confident that will hit in the $200 million range. So that should pick up throughout the year. And I think that those are both pretty significant points, and nobody ever knows what the weather is going to be. We can't really tell you what impact we\u2019re going to have from competition or the economy. One, we would hope the tax reform is at least a floor on travel demand. We\u2019re not doing anything overt to plan for a pickup in travel demand because of that, but obviously we\u2019re hopeful that that will be a lift as well. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Gary, just to start off, I have a couple of tax reform questions. But Tammy referred to this in prepared comments. We would love to get your take on as well. Southwest is really in this unique position among airlines, because you guys are the only airlines that will benefit immediately from the cash tax savings, as well as from new corporate tax rate. So I would love to get your thoughts for a moment. How are you all prioritizing this increased cash flow? We\u2019ve already seen the special bonus to employees. But beyond that, are you all thinking about increased reinvestment in the business, or should we be thinking about a step up in capital returns to shareholders? Because it seems like your free cash flow could really step up quite a bit because of the tax reform here. Gary Kelly : I'll just offer unsolicited editorial comment it is about time that we level the playing field competitively on this matter, as well as comparing our industry to other sectors. And obviously, Jack, you are well-informed on that. But we\u2019re very happy with that. It helps us lower our cost and we\u2019re not going to squander these savings. It puts us in a much better competitive position. So the priorities are -- I don\u2019t know if they are equal. But clearly, we all want to use this as an opportunity to keep our overall cost structure below so that we can keep our fares low, drive strong load factors and to continue to support our growth plan. There's enough money available to us where we can think about investments in the business. And Tammy explained well what we did with our Boeing order, but we have two, in terms of putting additional capital to work in the business, we have two basic options. We can buy more airplanes and use them to grow the fleet or we can buy new airplanes and use them to replace older aircraft. And we have opportunities certainly in the latter that we'll be exploring aggressively. The Boeing order is an example of that. So there may be more opportunities there in the future. I do want to be clear and say that we're not today thinking that we're going to increase our growth rate by buying more aircraft. If that happens, because circumstances support that, I think we'll all be very happy. But that is not what we're thinking today. In terms of taking care of our -- so I've talked about customers, I've talked about investing in the business, in terms of taking care of our employees. We're 85% unionized. So labor -- I've read some, what I would call, uninformed comments in the media. All compensation has to be negotiated with covered employees. So that is a separate issue. And then finally, in terms of continuing to support our shareholders, it just puts us in a stronger position to continue doing what we've been doing, which is for the past -- I can't remember Brian how many years we've increased the dividend annually and we have obviously sustained a very healthy share repurchase program. And I think it is worth mentioning, last year was a rough year in terms of mother nature and in terms of some of the tragedies around the country and it's a source of an immense pride at Southwest that we're able to support our communities and I was very happy that we were in position where we could actually boost that support also. Jack Atkins : Asking about tax reform from another angle though. One area that I think folks are under-appreciating is potential for boosting the economy in the relatively near term from tax reform, hitting folks\u2019 pocket books sooner rather than later in addition to increase business confidence. So you said in your comments earlier, you're not prepared you're planning for increased travel demand. But as you think about how this progresses over the next several quarters as we go into the spring summer travel season, and as we get into the peak travel season into the fall. It just seems to me like there's a real opportunity here for a pickup in leisure travel in addition to business travel. And I would just love to get some more thoughts on that specific topic? Gary Kelly : Well Jack, I agree with you. Again, I just don't want to give people the wrong impression about what we are committed to do today, but I realize there's angst among some about the growth rate of the industry. But I think a lot of people expect that GDP growth will accelerate. I think it'd be very logical to assume from that that you could see a boost in travel demand. Honestly, I think people should calm down and I think this could prove to be much to do about nothing. Now, we\u2019re growing this year and we\u2019re planning to add new service to Hawaii. We\u2019re going to open up Paine Field in Everett, Washington, and we\u2019re a growth company we know how to do this. So we\u2019ll want to manage our growth very carefully. The success for us is dependent upon keeping our cost low, so we can keep fairs low and we can attract new customers either by simulating or by moving them over to Southwest. I think what you\u2019re talking about is, I don\u2019t if it\u2019s a safety net, but it ought to provide some support for the current growth plans. And again, I just would reiterate that we haven\u2019t changed our growth plan because of tax reform, but it should put us in a position where that is more of a realistic option in the future. It won\u2019t happen for us in 2018, Andrew. I mean there is -- we have the potential to push our utilization somewhat, but not much and probably not. So I think any future growth thoughts, in my opinion, would be beyond 2018 in any event. And I\u2019ll just reiterate one more time what Tammy reported. In terms of exercising the Boeing orders has no impact to what our growth plans were or are for those years after 2018 as well. It\u2019s simply firming up options that we had planned to exercise in any event and now we have the bright economics to go ahead and move forward and make that commitment. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Gary, I want to continue this talk of fleet process we\u2019ve talked about a little bit in the call. What were -- would you consider a new fleet type if there was significant cockpit commonality and maybe just overall commonality with the 37, or did your experience with AirTran 717 totally sour you on that concept? Gary Kelly : Hunter, no, it did not. But I just will repeat what I know you know, but the opportunity for us with 7117 versus 737 trade-off was an opportunity to replace a smaller airplane that was not common with a bigger airplane that it is common at the same cost. So it was a no brainer and that trade alone Tammy, as I recall, was worth couple of hundred million dollars a year. So that\u2019s part of the earnings boost that we\u2019re realizing over the past five years. But we could have done it. Now Mike never got to the point where we integrated that aircraft into Southwest Airlines. So every flight that it took after we acquired AirTran was on the AirTran operating certificate. So we never realized what\u2019s you\u2019re asking. I think the time horizon is important in answering your question. I would assume that in a generation that we would be open minded to what you\u2019re suggesting in terms of my opening comments about thinking about 2018 and what\u2019s our focus, it\u2019s focused very much on the basics, running a great operation, offering great customer service and managing our cost. It is not anything that we are thinking about for 2018, \u201819, \u201820, \u201921, as far as I can see, there is no work underway here at all to think about a different airplane. I don\u2019t believe we have optimized our fleet mix yet with the mix of 800/MAX 8 versus 700s. And of course we don\u2019t have a MAX 7 yet. So I do think that there is an opportunity to continue up-gauging here for some time, and that also puts off any serious thought about adding a different fleet type, because we don\u2019t have the, what we consider to be the optimal fleet yet anyway. Boeing has other variations they\u2019ve got the MAX 9. Right now, we don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that we have any interest in the airplane. There is a MAX 10 coming and then what's casually referred to in the media is the 797 or 757 replacement. Both the MAX 10 and this -- the idea of the 757 replacement or things that we\u2019ll talk to Boeing about just make sure we understand what those airplanes do, what they don\u2019t do, but there is no serious effort to bring them on board. And so finally, it would be a lot of work, I will to admit to you. It would be a lot of work for us to take that on, because we are hardwired to operate the 737. We certainly have better capabilities today than we did when we bought AirTran to take that work on, but it doesn't mean that it would still be free of cost or free of effort. And right now, we have immense opportunities to grow with the 737 MAX 8, MAX 7 that we\u2019re very excited about and that will be our focus, I think for a long time. Hunter Keay : And then just maybe a quick one. I appreciate the commentary on margin expansion. And just to be clear, that\u2019s even with moving $157 million of option premium expense above the line, you are referring to EBIT margin when you talk about expanding margin this year. Is that correct? Tammy Romo : Yes, that\u2019s correct, even with that. Hunter Keay : And by the way, that [$115 million] is that about right, Tammy? Tammy Romo : It\u2019s actually 135ish for the year. And by the way, since you are asking about that, our goal would be to bring that down in 2019 and we\u2019re budgeting somewhere in the $80 million range for that. So that will be a nice tailwind for us as we move to the 2019. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : I wonder if you could -- I know you haven\u2019t given guidance based on the new accounting standard. But maybe just high-level what you think the impacts would be to revenue growth, unit cost growth and margins in '18? Tammy Romo : We are still looking at all that. So I really would rather wait and provide all that for you in the 8-K. We\u2019re just in the middle of finalizing all those results. So if you could just be a little more patient for us, we\u2019ll come back with a very robust report later this quarter. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then just how are you thinking about the cash tax rate under the new regime? Tammy Romo : Our tax rates have been more like the 20% range and we\u2019ll -- I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be any worst than that as we move forward. We're still working through some of the technicalities on the depreciation rule. By the time we get to later this year, we're expecting full 100% expensing in the year that we acquire the aircraft. So we're still working through a little bit of that to finalize it. But obviously, it will have a very meaningful impact on our cash taxes for the year and that we noted in the earnings release, we expect that to be in the hundreds of millions dollars a year and that both on a P&L perspective as well as on a cash basis, so it\u2019s very significant. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Just on the -- just a follow-up Tammy on the fuel hedge comments, and I am glad to hear that the target to bring the premium down. But curious with lot of these -- it doesn't seem like you're getting much of a asset here in 2018, even though fuel is going to run up. So I am guessing kept your traffic levels that you're pinning the hedges that are pretty high. Given that most of your competitors aren\u2019t hedging either, I mean what's maybe a better question. How are you shifting your hedging strategy, because it doesn't seem to be necessarily paying off? Tammy Romo : We just look at it differently, Savi. The hedging strategy is really insurance potential for us, in the event we see a spike in fuel prices as it'll start kicking and showing some nice gains here, and in fact already seeing that. But it's really designed to provide protection should be seen on anticipated sites and in the fuel prices. So we expect our premium budget every year, and that we've a goal of that, we would have very meaningful protection, should prices rise to more catastrophic levels. But in the meantime, we're actually seeing some nice gains here. And as you'll see another jump up as you get into even the $75 per barrel range. And Savi if you look at our sensitivity analysis that we normally provide, you'll see what I am referring to, but is really designed for us so that should prices rise, we have time to adjust the business to those higher input costs. So we really think of a bit more as the insurance protections. Now going forward more tactically with the techniques that we're using going forward, we're mindful of the downside exposure in the way we have our hedges layered on. We do not have any downside risk or floor exposure, over -- well for our entire hedge book. So I think we are very well positioned. Savi Syth : And just follow-up on that, the target is the $80 million, how do you achieve that? Tammy Romo : Pardon me, Savi. Savi Syth : How do you achieve the reductions to $80 million? Tammy Romo : That we've been layering on our hedges and where we are -- by doing that, we\u2019ve had opportunities to build what I would say a very nice hedge positions at very reasonable fuel premium level. So keep in mind we\u2019ve been building up to deep levels and that\u2019s the result of the price be up but the options that we put in place. Gary Kelly : And Savi, I didn\u2019t look back at the press release, but there is heavier weight in 2018. So 2019 is a really good hedge. It\u2019s got a nice balance between how much money we\u2019ve spent on it, the covers that we get and then the sensitivities that Tammy has provided in there. So it\u2019s really a very clean hedge as is 2020, we\u2019re off to a good start with that one. 2018 has a little swap in it as I recall Tammy because we had to go in and unwind some of the puts that were on. So there was little bit of penalty, if you will, in terms of the way that that year was built. But if part of your question is, do we think $135 million is a right number? No. Tammy and I both agree that that\u2019s more money than we want to spend on the program, especially considering that our margins are handsome and that we have opportunities to grow the margins in addition to that. So there is -- we\u2019re well under absorbed more risk with energy prices going up than we were going back to 2012-2013 when we had much tighter margins and a more ambitious transformation plan that was underway. So we have a different time. We have a different opportunity. And I think our folks have done a great job of taking full advantage of that. Savi Syth : That\u2019s all very helpful color, thank you. And just a quick one on the unit revenue, you mentioned that the demand -- so the demand was strong on the peak period. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing in the off peak. And just wondering if industry just has a little too much supply in the off peak, and is there anything we can do about that as we continue to layer on supply? Tammy Romo : Demand for us, Savi, through the first quarter as you can see from our load factor performance was very strong. We are generating record load factor performances. And of course the story there has been at lower yield. So we certainly win, we\u2019re in off peak seasons. I think it\u2019s fair to say we all have to work a little harder for that demand. But as you could see from our fourth quarter performance and based on the outlook that we provided you earlier in the call that we\u2019re seeing very nice demand even in the off peak period. Gary Kelly : Andrew, you can comment on this, if you would like. But the industry overtime has gotten better and better at varying capacity according to seasonality. And I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that we were the late to that gain, because we were just hard wired to have a constant schedule throughout the year. But now I feel like we have fully caught up there. So you have some -- some of the competitors have a more pronounced peak and valley in terms of the scheduling than others, but the capabilities are there. And I\u2019ll just again speak for Southwest. I think we do a pretty darn good job of matching that. Now we felt like going back to 2017 that we had one schedule that maybe it was a little bit too long and didn\u2019t move into the seasonally softer period fasten now. And it was -- I don\u2019t know that I would call it a mistake per se. But it is a change that we have already planned for 2018, as an example. So it's an iterative process. You learn as you go and school in school out the timing of holiday, all of these things are fairly complex inputs. But I agree with what Tammy said, we\u2019re looking at a record loan factor, potentially here again in the first quarter. So the demand is there and even with seasonality. Tammy Romo : One more comment just to add on to that, particularly with some of our new international market that does provide us opportunities and maybe do a little more seasonal flying than what we\u2019ve done this 4Q. So our commercial folks do a fantastic job managing through those peak demand periods. Gary Kelly : Yes. And what we don\u2019t do is we don\u2019t very much by day of week. And that is something that we have on our to-do list to get better at that. We do vary by day of week but not as much as we know we could. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s an opportunity for us respectively. Operator : We will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : Gary, I have a question for you about Huston and Dallas specifically. With oil prices up $20 in the last five or six months, are you seeing better system traffic out of those two locations than perhaps elsewhere on the network? Gary Kelly : Well, Midland is the one that\u2019s so easy to see plus or minus and it\u2019s really strong. I will say after this really tumultuous time in the energy markets over the past three to four years, we just haven't suffered in our energy markets like you\u2019re remembering decades ago. So it has been interesting. And of course you\u2019ve also seen the U.S. oil and gas activity has a collapse. They managed their way pretty effectively to $50 crude oil. So I don\u2019t -- Andrew, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve seen a very significant variation there. I think what you see in a more pronounced way is where there's just a lot of competitive activity, and that of course is out in the west. And Texas is an entity and Houston Dallas specifically both look very strong. And again, I don\u2019t know that I would attribute that to a change in the last quarter of oil prices up 10 bucks a barrel, I don\u2019t think that that activity is fluctuated all that much. Andrew Watterson : Over the long horizon both states have become much more economically diversified -- and even Houston itself with how it's been with Southside of town with significant medical industry in the Southside town continues with the economy. Helane Becker : And then just a question on Hawaii. Tammy you made a comment in your prepared remarks about bit of a headwind with ETOPS qualifications et cetera for this year. I mean is that given how big the airline is and the comments that you guys just made about more diversification. Is that just de minimis cost or will we actually see that in the numbers? Tammy Romo : Helane, it's de minis, yes and I was referring to -- that was just the investment for to get started in Hawaii and the spend related to ETOPS. So I just want to be clear. We're on track with respect to ETOPS. So it's all green at least at this point with respect to our plans to start service to Hawaii. And yes, the spins related to that is really is that significant. Gary Kelly : I was just going to give an update on the when, that while I agree with Tammy that we're on track with our work plan, we're just now -- that means that we're at the point where we've submitted to the FAA an application. And now the work begins with the FAA, if you will, although we've been partnering very well with them on the application up to this point. So we don't have any further update today on when we might be publishing and when we might be flying. Our goal is to do both this year but I think we're all very confident that we'll at least be selling by the end of this year. But there's really no more information to offer other than we were at least on track but are all work plan to this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Tammy, I just want to come back to the comment about margins. When you say margins that\u2019s including the hedge gains and losses year-on-year, right? Tammy Romo : That's right. To be very clear, yes. Brandon Oglenski : So if we were to back out the hedge loss last year the hedge gains this year then we\u2019re probably going to be flat to down on margins, right? Tammy Romo : Are you talking 20\u2026. Brandon Oglenski : Right, well that's for us to do, I know you haven't guided for that. So I guess my question is with your RASM guidance for the first quarter. When do we start to realize the benefits from the reservation system? And can you talk through what those are again. Because I know we had some negative impacts on the implementation in 3Q and 4Q. I think you guys said on your last call that it should have been out of the run rate of revenue by now. So can you give us an update on how we should see that progress through the year? Tammy Romo : Sure, I'd be happy to. We don't have exact numbers to give you there, but certainly directionally, the impact here in first quarter we're not expecting that to be significant at all. And then as we move into the second quarter, we should start seeing some benefits but we\u2019ll just be picking up some theme there. And then really the bulk of the benefit will be in the second half of the year. So I am hesitant to throw out any numbers, because we're in the middle of all of this. But by the second quarter, we're hopefully ramping up to something more in the $50 million plus range and then with the bulk of the benefit again coming in the second half. Gary Kelly : Let me clarify here your margin question though. The guidance that Tammy offered up and then I offered up is just CASM, excluding all the items would be flat to down, number one. Number two, then -- so it excludes fuel. So then number two, we told you that we\u2019re at a positive revenue outlook for the first quarter, and that\u2019s our goal for the year. So that margin expansion is coming without fuel. So we\u2019re fuel -- and I was careful to mention that fuel prices, it was excluding fuel prices. So you\u2019ll have to factor fuel prices. And on a hedge basis then to determine the operating margin effect of that. But based on futures prices right now, we would have margin expansion. Brandon Oglenski : And I understand that and I guess that would be my follow up question. I mean it\u2019s been a tough two days for airline stocks here. What I\u2019m insinuating is that if we back out the hedges like if we just took you to market rates on fuel, it\u2019s pretty tough to get margins up if not even down this year. And that\u2019s the case for a lot of airlines\u2026 Gary Kelly : No, that\u2019s not what I said. I said without fuel, our margins would be up. So I think in other words as keeping fuel constant or however you want to think about it, our margins would be up. CASM ex-fuel right now is -- our guidance that we gave you is flat to down and RASM, the goal is positive. That means margin expansion without fuel. Brandon Oglenski : Maybe that\u2019s on apples-to-apples here, but the input cost underlying all this right has gone up a lot. So I think what investors are looking for is and I don\u2019t want you to comment about other airlines, obviously, but what are expectations for how does the industry adapt to an underlying higher cost structure. And when should we start to see that. Because if I go through the -- your capacity growth is about the same as you\u2019ve been effectively guiding you not for maybe the past three or four quarters. But obviously the underlying cost of business has come up a lot. So what should be the proper investor expectations for when we start to see some adaptations here, what is fundamentally a higher cost structure now? Gary Kelly : I understand. So obviously we\u2019re not in line with the rest of the industry. We have a better outlook than they do, superior margins, superior returns. And what they will do, I can\u2019t tell you. So I don\u2019t know. What we\u2019re going to do is what we\u2019ve shared with you we think we have a very superb position and outlook for this year. And again I\u2019m very excited about the prospects for 2018. We should see operating margin expansion, given the current outlook for fuel prices, and then it will be even easier for us because of the tax reform to see even better net margin expansion. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Tammy, two questions, one is just on the CapEx for the year. When you indicate your aircraft CapEx would be eight, back down to\u2026 Tammy Romo : Michael, you\u2019re breaking up a little bit there. Would you mind trying that again? Michael Linenberg : I was asking about CapEx. And I think you\u2019re guiding to $1.9 billion. And I think you indicated today that the aircraft piece is $1 billion. When we go back to January, when you had your 8-K, I think you indicated that it was a little bit less -- it was going to less than $1 billion. So maybe there is some rounding there. So when I look at the non-aircraft piece, knowing that you did push I think $115 million into '18. It still seems like that that\u2019s a pretty high non-aircraft piece. Normally, I think you\u2019re in that $500 million $600 million range when you don\u2019t have big projects underway. So I was just curious what's driving that, call it $900 million, $900 million plus of non-aircraft CapEx? Tammy Romo : The non-aircraft CapEx, we\u2019re seeing -- actually our technology CapEx, we\u2019re expecting that to be down a little bit due to the completion of the One Res. And we\u2019re seeing a little higher mix of our technology spend hitting OpEx. So that\u2019s impacting that. Where we\u2019re seeing the increase is really more in facilities. And we have some plans related to some of our hangers that\u2019s impacting that and some investments relating to our pilots training facility, so that\u2019s up a little bit. So we\u2019re seeing our technology down little bit, but that\u2019s being offset by an increase in facility. So those are the major drivers there. Michael Linenberg : So those are the big ones. And then just on the unit cost guide to be up flat to down, and I know last quarter you said you felt confident about flat. And since then, the only thing that I can think that has changed is that we had the fourth quarter bump up in '17 on the employee cost, and I think that was like 3.5 points. Is that the primary difference between the guidance today versus where we were a quarter ago? Or there are couple other things that maybe you are hoping to drive a better CASM outlook? Tammy Romo : You really nailed it, Mike. There is really nothing significant from the last update that we provided. But as you already noted, we did have higher expense due to the employee tax reform benefit. So that made our comps a little bit easier but we have to rebound that still really -- I think our comps outlook for this year is very solid. And as ever, we are very focused on our cost and we\u2019ll continue to be very diligent there in our cost control efforts. But that\u2019s the primary driver from our previous guidance. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Gary, a question for you. You\u2019ve obviously seen the announcement by United, and they seem to be pushing little more aggressively in some important markets to you. Is that something that investors should be concerned about? Or do you think that maybe they are looking at a different type of passenger than you are focused on, and so there shouldn\u2019t be much of an impact? Gary Kelly : Well, admittedly anytime flights are added or flights are subtracted from a market, there is an impact. So I wouldn\u2019t want to ever \u2013 try to put one past to you. It\u2019s just not truthful to say that. So adding capacity will definitely dilute some traffic. But I think back to the future there with Jaime's opening question, we focus on nonstop, low fare traffic, and a high cost legacy airline does not. And there are many, many historic examples where we might have a share of seeds in a market, but a significantly higher share of traffic in that market. And again it's because they don't want to fill up their segments with low fare customers at the expense of choking off the higher fare opportunities that they have with the connecting passenger through their hub. In your life time, we've gone from being a very small player in Texas to the largest airline in the country, fundamentally based on what I just described. It is a cost advantage that translates to a fare advantage and we generate a dramatic number of customers, over 130 million for last year. And Tom I think that's the second largest in the world. So the markets that I recall that they spiked out, we have a very significant presence in. In one case we have a different airport and I would argue an airport advantage. So will it impact us? Yes. Will it harm Southwest Airlines? It's bold talk. But we should always be humble and always respectful of our competitors and we are in this case. But I think we have all the tools we need to continue to perform well in every market that were impacted. And I just will remind you that 10 years ago we were barely starting in Denver, and 12 years later, we're the number one airline in terms of the number of passengers in Denver. So I kind of rest my case. In this case, you\u2019ve got legacy carriers who were not prepared, went bankrupt, shrunk, they shed cost and are using that as a strategy and now an opportunity when times are better to try to reclaim some that they lost and gave up. And that will be very, very hard battle for them. Rajeev Lalwani : And then just another quick one for you, just maybe for Tammy. You talked about just dollars from tax reform, et cetera. Should we take that to mean that the capital -- the CapEx number that you put out for this year, maybe the floor and maybe we should look to -- for that number to either move up or stay where it is going forward? Tammy Romo : Well, we will -- it's not going to -- I guess, it wouldn\u2019t go down from here, we'll start there. But we\u2019ve given you all of our plans at least so far. And just pointing back to what Gary walked you through earlier, any opportunities on the capital side would probably be more along the lines of fleet in terms of opportunities to continue to renew our fleet. But right now, you have a order book and we are at very manageable level, but outside of making the fleet and essential opportunities there to modernize and invest in the business, in that way. But for 2018, there's really -- I think that would be our big opportunity and we'll explore that. But again, I don\u2019t know if it would have a meaningful impact on here on 2018. Operator : That concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I first like to introduce Ms. Laurie Barnett, Managing Director of Communications and Outreach. Laurie Barnett : Thank you, Tom. I\u2019d like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Tom would you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for question. Operator : Yes, ma\u2019am [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now begin with our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Gary, you referred to uses of the tax savings. You said -- noted that compensation with your unionized employees is something that would have be negotiated. So what you\u2019re saying is that that you would not do a mid contract pay increase for your employees using some of that savings? Gary Kelly : Well, I didn\u2019t say that. But in other words, we can. If the two parties want to negotiate, we can negotiate it anytime. I just pointing out the obvious which is, unilaterally we\u2019re not going to wage or increase wages across the board because we can\u2019t by federal law, so all that has to be negotiated. Mary Schlangenstein : But you wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that you could do either open negotiation to do some side agreement to a contract on increasing pay before the next contract is negotiated? Gary Kelly : I don\u2019t see that anything is different in 2018 than ever. So we have contracts in place. They take quite an effort to negotiate. We have several contracts that are up for amendment this year, so that will obviously be the priority. So I\u2019m not suggesting, Mary, that I think all of a sudden we are or our unions would want to do that. I\u2019m just pointing out that if the two sides agree, we can always do that. And our outlook is what we\u2019ve reported and any long-term commitments we make will always be with an eye towards just trying to be prepared for the unexpected. And I think there were several questions earlier today about fuel cost increases. And I was interviewed earlier this morning about my concerns on the outlook. And it\u2019s those kinds of things that I am mostly focused and concerned about, in other words fuel -- oil price increases and the impact that that would have. So while we have seen significant reductions in our taxes, there were always other challenges that we have out there in all those things would have to be factored into the any long term commitments that we would ever take. Mary Schlangenstein : And just if I could clarify one thing you said. You made a comment from the 7379, and I didn\u2019t catch what you said. Did you say you might be interested in that aircraft? Gary Kelly : I said that as it stands today, we don\u2019t have any interest in adding that aircraft to our fleet. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won't change our mind at some point. But the net of a long answer was we love the 737 MAX 8. We\u2019re working with Boeing on 737 MAX 7. I'm sure that that will be a wonderful aircraft when it\u2019s ready. And that is our focus and we\u2019re not working on anything else when it comes to the fleet, just those two. Operator : We will take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine : I am just looking for a little bit of help to understand exactly how these tax changes are going to play out over a little bit longer term. I know you guys reported that the $1.4 billion been realized from 2017. Is that of the similar magnitude you guys are expecting in 2018, 2019? Was that a one-time thing because of just the timing of these changes? How much you expected this to reduce? How much you guys pay in federal taxes, going forward? Gary Kelly : So Conor, it\u2019s a very quick background. The tax return doesn\u2019t match our financial statements, so there\u2019s just different rules. So there is a tax liability on our books at a 35% tax rate that was related to all the years leading up to 2017. And we would have to pay that $1.4 billion based on the tax returns in the future. So since taxes are now at 21%, that\u2019s what's driving -- it's simply reducing that liability from 35% to 21%. And the cash amount for that would flow out over years in the future. That is not a proxy for what we would save each year now prospectively. And I would just put in the -- Tammy had hundreds of millions hits, it depends on what our earnings are for 2018. But if the earnings are close to what they were in 2017 is half of billion dollars. So it\u2019s a big amount of money and I think our investors all do the arithmetic and understand that very well. But it\u2019s that order of magnitude. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson : Two questions, first for Tammy. You mentioned that EarlyBird revenue totaled $100 million in the fourth quarter. And I don\u2019t remember your exact words, but you said that just to put that in perspective that was your initial target. Do you mean that\u2019s what you thought you would get annually from EarlyBird when it was introduced several years ago? Tammy Romo : Yes, going back when I\u2019ve said. The point I was making there is that it\u2019s been very successful. It\u2019s in high demand by our customers. But yes, we at this point, was as we achieved $100 million in one quarter, which we rolled it out was our target for the full year. Dawn Gilbertson : Is this the first time that\u2019s hit $100 million a quarter? Tammy Romo : That\u2019s been -- yes, this is -- which is kind of popped out to me\u2026 Gary Kelly : Yes, it was. Now Dawn in fairness, we\u2019re a bigger airline today than when we launched in 2009. But still I mean it's definitely well exceeded our expectations. Dawn Gilbertson : What about -- what's the total figure for the year on EarlyBird, Tammy? Tammy Romo : For the full year, I will pull that for you real quick. But it would be roughly -- if you'll hang on, we'll get back and report back. Dawn Gilbertson : And the other question related to that is, I mean any plans, you went from 12.50 -- I can\u2019t remember what started that, but I know then 12.50 and then 15. Is that likely to stay at 15 or given the success, might that be due for an increase? Gary Kelly : Well, we have to have some secrets. We're trying to keep our costs under control. We're trying to keep our fares low. So I think we've got a good opportunity to hold firm here at least for the meantime. Dawn Gilbertson : And then the other question Gary for you as it relates to Hawaii. And then I know you said from the very start, there was no guarantee you were going to start flying this year. But just in reading between the lines of what you just said briefly, it sounds to me like the chance are you're going to fly there this year sound very, very slim? Is that\u2026 Gary Kelly : No, I didn't intend that at all. So I think our goal has been from the offset to be flying by the end of the year. We didn't necessarily share all of that with you, but that was our goal. It\u2019s not -- achieving that goal is not totally within our control. I think what is actually encouraging is that in terms of the work that we do control, we are right on target. And Mike we're what six months into this, and I guess three months after our announcement. So we are well underway. I think there's a chance that we can be flying by the end of the year and that will be our goal. I think what we're much more confident in saying is that we'll be at least selling by the end of the year. But I don't think that we're less likely to be flying than we have been. If anything, we maybe more likely just because we know now what we've been able to get done over the past six months. Dawn Gilbertson : Where would you put the chances of flying this year at? Gary Kelly : I can't -- I don't know how to do that. Because again, we're working with the federal government, and now we'll be dependent upon their timetable and then they may come up with work that we may be underestimated. So I just don't know that there's any way to handicap that. But what I'm told our team is in the grand scheme of things, whether we're flying late this year or early next year, it won't matter over the next generation. I think mainly we want to do this work; we want to do it; we want to do it well; we want to watch when everything is all lined up. And if we get it done, and we\u2019re up and flying by the end of this year, I'll be happy. I think everybody will be. If we don't, it won't be the end of the world. Dawn Gilbertson : When is the next schedule extension after February 15th? Gary Kelly : Roughly 60 days later. Dawn Gilbertson : Will that\u2026 Gary Kelly : I would call that April 15th. Dawn Gilbertson : Will that fix you through the end of the year? Gary Kelly : No, probably takes into November, I would guess. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We take that question from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Gary, can you talk to me about the fixed appeal of Paine Field. Is there anything other than just the fact that Sea Tac is constrained, or does that bring more to the table than that? Gary Kelly : I do think it brings more to the table. It\u2019s attractive from a handful of aspects. So one is we\u2019re really good at applying to alternative airports. And if you have low cost and low fares, it helps people become aware of that option. And so it is bringing something new in that sense, so I\u2019m forgetting the Sea Tac for a second. And the second thing is there is a significant pool of customers north of the city that just ground traffic constraints are such that if they have more convenient flight option, I think that they will take that. And we\u2019ve seen that benefit again throughout our 46 year history, if we can provide a more convenient airport, and I think that sort of hit several criteria. This airport is going to be by definition a lot smaller, and I think for customers. And there is -- if there is -- that\u2019s a more pleasurable experience in some ways. You don\u2019t have as many flight options, which is drawback sometimes but really small airport. But all those things I think are very meaningful. But you hit on it on the point also, which is Sea Tac for us, we\u2019re constrained and we do want to increase our presence in the Seattle Metro area, and this is a really good opportunity for us to do that. And then finally there is only five daily departures left with what the airport has planned for in terms of real estate, I think they\u2019ve got two gates. So if we don\u2019t move on this, we may likely lose the opportunity. And we\u2019ll certainly be able to accommodate five more round trips with our capacity plans. So I\u2019m excited about it. It\u2019s something that two years ago really wasn\u2019t on our radar. And I think it will be a nice opportunity and a real plus for our customers than the Seattle Metro area. Robert Silk : Just one quick follow up. The five left for the five year taking, or is it those five plus five more? Gary Kelly : My understanding is that this takes the airport to 24 daily departures and that is the capacity that they have built. So it\u2019s not a governmental constraint, it is just the practical capacity of the terminal. Operator : And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Ms. Laurie Barnett for any additional or closing remarks. Laurie Barnett : Thank you, Tom. I\u2019m going to turn it back to Tammy to provide that answer regarding EarlyBird. Tammy Romo : Yes. Dawn, it was just that $400 million for the full year. Gary Kelly : That\u2019s convenient. Laurie Barnett : Excellent. Well members of the media, if you have any other questions, our communications group is standing by at 214-792-4847. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

David Koenig - The Associated Press Operator : Welcome to the Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. My name is Tom and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and the replay will be available on the Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ryan. Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom, and I want to welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and CEO, and Gary will kick us off with a few opening remarks. We have Tammy Romo, our Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance and outlook. Tom Nealon, our President, will cover revenue trends and outlooks; and Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an update regarding Flight 1380. A few disclaimers before we get started. Today's call will include forward-looking statements based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause actual results to be materially different. We will also include references to non-GAAP results, which excludes special items. You can reference this morning's earnings release for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results. And I also want to note that the company adopted three new accounting standards effective January 1, 2018. Certain prior-year financial information has been recast to reflect the adoption of these new standards. And for more information, please reference our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on March 20. You can find our earnings release and our SEC filings on the Investor Relations section of Southwest.com. And following our prepared remarks, we will open it up for questions. So at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. And I am pleased to have the opportunity to update our shareholders on a couple of important matters. I want to start by sharing that our priority remains supporting and caring for all of those that were affected by Flight 1380 last week and, of course, in particular, the family and loved ones of Jennifer Riordan. She was an extraordinary person and, of course, we all mourn her passing. It was a dark day, but the compassion and concern and support since the event have been truly extraordinary and it just touches your soul. Our five-person flight crew, led by Captain Tammy Jo Shults, performed magnificently. Our Ground Operations Team in Philadelphia threw themselves into the task of supporting all of the customers on that flight, which took many hours. And on behalf of Southwest Airlines, I want to thank all of our competitors who came to our customers' aid that day. There were many, but I especially want to thank American Airlines. And finally, I want to thank the selfless customers who heroically pitched in to help while the flight was being diverted to Philadelphia. In the aftermath, we had many teams that have sprung into action for support of our customers and our employees, for that matter, as well as the NTSB. We have an equal priority, and that is ensuring that there are no blades with metal fatigue. And our tech-ops team working with GE, CFM, Boeing and the FAA have truly led the industry through new inspection protocols, and for us, it dates back to 2016. So last week, we accelerated the inspections. They are going well. I've been very pleased with the preliminary findings, which reveal no cracks or fatigue. We're working with GE, CFM and the FAA very closely to ensure we're in full compliance of CFM's service bulletins as well as the FAA's Emergency Airworthiness Directive that was issued last Friday, and we continue to work with and support, of course, the NTSB in their investigation of this event. We have multiple tasks underway, and I want to assure you that the Southwest team is up to the task. And the next priority I want to cover is our business. Our first quarter results were very solid, despite it not being our best revenue performance, but it was still solid. Strong margins, excellent cost performance, strong return on capital, strong free cash flow, and shareholder returns makes for the second-best earnings per share for a first quarter in our history. The booking softness that we mentioned in the press release since last week is predictable, and excluding that effect and taking into account the Easter timing shift away from this year's second quarter, the sequential trends look pretty normal to me. Regardless, our revenue plan this year has always been a second-half story, and we've implemented better revenue management techniques already in first quarter to manage against overly aggressive discounting. And we have several major enhancements to revenue management taking effect midyear relating to our new reservation system that you all are already aware of. And of course, finally, we will be optimizing our flight schedule roughly every 60 days as the second half unfolds. And the bottom line of all this is demand has been strong. It remains strong. Tax reform should help that. Our outlook is positive, and the prospect of record non-GAAP earnings per share is very much alive. A couple of other notable items in the release. We announced four Hawaii destinations : Honolulu, Kona, Maui, and Lihue, and our Hawaii work remains on track. And we announced firming up 40 more MAX 8 options from the 2026-2027 time period, moving them to ten per year starting in 2019. This is first and foremost an extension of our fleet modernization strategy. We have a very strong business case to replace older 737-700 aircraft, given the superior economics of the MAX 8. The tax reform benefit for Southwest makes this capital investment more feasible, and of course I want to thank Boeing for their support in making that happen. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tammy Romo to elaborate further on our first quarter results. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Gary, and thank you all for being on our call today. I also want to express my gratitude for our employees and how they pulled together to take care of our customers and each other during incidents like last week's accident. That's what families do in difficult times, and I am very proud to work alongside all of our compassionate and caring people. This morning, we reported a strong first quarter performance with net income, excluding special items of $438 million, up 22% year-over-year, and our earnings per share was $0.75, up an exceptional 29% year-over-year and $0.01 above consensus. Our operating margins was a solid 11.8%, in line with first quarter last year. And our net margin was 8.9%, an improvement from first quarter 2017, 7.4%, as we begin to realize significant savings from the lower corporate tax rate. Our pre-tax ROIC was 27.1%, or 20.8% on an after-tax basis for the 12 months ended March 31. Our first quarter revenue performance was right in line with our previous guidance. Our cost performance was better than expected, and that's primarily due to some spins shifting into second quarter with a solid cost outlook for the year. While we are off our plan here in the first half of the year, the benefits from our new reservation system are ramping up in the second quarter with more significant benefits coming in the second half. We also expect the pressure from our sub-optimal schedule to recede in third quarter as we overcome our fleet deficit from our Classic retirement last fall. Based on everything we know so far, we expect our second quarter year-over-year unit revenue performance to be a bottom for the year, and we will keep after our goal to have positive unit revenues in the quarters ahead. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we had another quarter of very strong operating cash flow, allowing for $648 million of shareholder returns during the first quarter. And as we continue to modernize our fleet, we still have manageable capital spending this year of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. With strong first quarter margins under our belts along with benefits coming online from our new reservation system, a great fuel hedge that provides meaningful protection in a rising fuel environment and benefits from tax reform, we are well-positioned to achieve our goal to expand our 2018 net margin year-over-year excluding special items. And with that brief overview, I'll turn it over to Tom to walk you through our revenue trends and outlook. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Okay. Thank you, Tammy, Good morning, everyone. So let me start off with our Q1 performance and I'll jump right into Q2. So as you know, we had record operating revenues of $4.9 billion in the first quarter, which was driven by record passenger revenues of $4.6 billion. We also had very strong performance in Other revenues, which were up 19% year-over-year. And this is a combination of strength in our EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding products, both of which were up double digits for the quarter, as well as the continued strength in growth of our Rapid Rewards program and business partner revenues, which are both performing very well. And we also had, as you know, a record load factor of 81.5% for the concluded first quarter. So having said all that, our revenues grew right in line with our ASM growth of 1.8%. So, as we shared our 8-K last month, there were several factors that caused us to update our RASM guidance for the quarter, and I want to hit on those real quickly. The first factor was our March RASM trends, which were off for the first 20 days of March, and this was largely the results of the spring break calendar shift, which reduced travel demand more than we anticipated. This resulted in a little less than 1 point of negative impact to RASM. Having said that though, we finished March very strong with very strong RASM performance, and strong load factors. In fact, during the last 11 days in March, we saw our yields grow in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year. And in particular, as Tammy said, the Easter calendar shift from April to March gave us a benefit of roughly $40 million. The second factor we called out in our 8-K was our sub-optimal flight schedule and I think you all understand this. But as you know, we're in the middle of a fleet transition, which means that we had fewer planes to fly in the schedule, which then means that we're extending the day and doing more flying early in the morning and later into the night, and this generally results in lower yields. But just to be clear, these flights are still profitable and they contribute to the overall network profitability. But there was, in fact, a negative RASM impact for the quarter. And as Tammy said, you'll begin to see this recede in the third quarter as new aircraft come into service. And the final factor was the competitive fair environments. And on this one, I want to speak specifically to California, which is, obviously, a very competitive market, and we've been competing very aggressively, and we will continue to do that. You all know that we have a very strong market position in California. And, in fact, we have a 63% intra-Cal market share and a 26% market share for all commercial air travel, which includes international in and out of California. We've added a fair amount of capacity into California and even with our additional flights, we've been able to increase our load factors and we're getting new first time Southwest customers. It is, in fact, impacting our RASM. But we have low costs, low fares, high load factors and strong operating margins. We are generating strong profits and we're gaining new customers, and that's not a bad formula. We are very well prepared to compete, and we will succeed. The combined RASM impact of the sub-optimal schedule in the fare environment was roughly 1 point of RASM for the quarter. So, that's Q1. Now let's talk about Q2. At the macro level, we are seeing strong demand, as Gary suggested, pretty much throughout the quarter and it tends to be across all regions. Now having said that, I think that we have several unique factors that are impacting our second quarter RASM and it gets us to a guide of down 1% to 3%. And the first, as you'd expect, is the impact of Flight 1380. We are forecasting lost revenue to be in the range of 1% to 2% in terms of RASM for the quarter. And just for context, in the first week since the accident, we've seen somewhere between 0.5 point and a 1 point of RASM decline so far. That was skewed towards close-in bookings that will be very tough for us to recover. But we're also seeing an impact on travel for May and beyond. So, the full revenue impact isn't totally clear, but we do expect there would a continued impact for some period of time. Now keep in mind, last Tuesday, we turned off all of our marketing immediately upon the accident. And that included all television, all emails, all paid search, all paid display, all paid social, everything. And that's pretty significant. Those marketing vehicles drive a lot of traffic to Southwest.com. And we only began to slowly bring our marketing back up this past weekend. But as we went back into the market, we did begin to see traffic to Southwest.com ramp back up, but it is not yet back to normal levels. And I think that with an event like this, this is pretty much what I'd expect to see. Traffic will rebound, but it's not there yet. The second factor I want to hit on is the continued impact of the shoulder flying that I covered in Q1 update. And it's really the same thing. We will have this with us throughout the second quarter, but we will begin to see that diminish in the third quarter as we bring new planes into service. And the third factor is the ongoing competitive environment in California. As I said, we are generating strong profits and we are well prepared to compete and we will succeed financially and with our Southwest customers. Now on the other side of the equation, we're also still on track to see $40 million to $50 million of benefit in the second quarter from our new res system, as we discussed in the past. And we continue to feel very confident that we'll capture $200 million annual benefit that we discussed with you in the past. So while we are clearly off of our revenue plan for the first half of 2018, the second quarter is the bottom in terms of our year-over-year RASM trends. Things will begin to kick in and improve in the second half of the year. We'll begin to get our fleet back in balance with our new aircraft deliveries. We'll begin to re-optimize the schedule with the new aircrafts and we'll see the increasing benefit with the reservation system. And as you expect from Southwest Airlines, we are very focused on solid earnings, solid margins and strong returns in the second quarter. So, we are very optimistic, and with that, Tammy, I'm going to turn it back to you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Tom. Turning to fuel, our first quarter 2018 economic fuel price per gallon of $2.09 included a $0.05 hedging gain from settled contracts and a $0.07 hedging premium cost. There was a lot of volatility during the first quarter, but actual market prices ended up being down only slightly from original expectations in January. Looking ahead to second quarter, based on market prices and our hedging portfolio as of April 20, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.20, including an estimated $0.07 hedging gain and a $0.06 hedging premium cost. And for full year 2018, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.15 to $2.20 range. And that includes an estimated $0.06 hedging gain and a $0.06 hedging premium cost. Our 2018 fuel hedge position are producing modest gains at current Brent crude market prices with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and above. Our hedge portfolio for 2018 and beyond provides us protection against catastrophic rises in energy prices without floor risk exposure, and it enables us to make prudent adjustments to our business in a rising fuel price environment in order to maintain our financial goals and reduce volatility in our earnings. We are continuing to realize fuel efficiency benefits from our ongoing fleet modernization. Our first quarter ASMs per gallon improved by 1.3% year-over-year; for 2018, we continue to expect a 2% to 3% improvement year-over-year in ASMs per gallon. Moving to our non-fuel cost, our first quarter non-fuel operating expenses excluding special items increased 1.4% and decreased slightly on a unit basis year-over-year. Our unit costs came in slightly better than the low end of our latest guidance, primarily due to cost shifting to future quarters, such as advertising. Year-over-year increases in salary, wages and benefits, maintenance and airport costs were offset by lower depreciation and aircraft rentals and due to Classic retirement benefits. For the second quarter, we expect our CASM, excluding fuel and profit-sharing, to increase in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year, and the primary drivers there include labor costs, including our agreement with AMFA and higher cost related to an extended operating day driven by our Classic retirement and our current fleet deficit; and as I mentioned earlier, cost shifting from first quarter and estimated costs related \u2013 and other more minor cost. For full year 2018, we now expect our CASM, excluding fuel and profit-sharing to be comparable year-over-year, and again this includes our agreement with AMFA. I am pleased with our first quarter cost performance, and we remain focused as always on controlling our costs and finding ways to be more productive and efficient. And now, before I cover our financial positions, capital deployment and growth outlook, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide an update on Flight 1380. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Okay. Well, thank you, Tammy. So, here's what we know from the NTSB so far. We had a failure of the number one engine, and there's an engine fan blade partially missing and that's blade 13 of 24. There was a remnant of the blade that was still attached to the fan hub; and when it was tested, it was found to be fatigued. And the NTSB has suggested that the fatigue fracture was the initiating event that caused fan blade 13 to break. Next, we know that the engine inlet cowling suffered significant damage and loss, and pieces of that cowling may be responsible for the damage to the fuselage, the wing and the stabilizer. And the loss of a single blade inside the engine just shouldn't have caused such dramatic impact. So as Gary mentioned, we're completely cooperating with the NTSB, and they're doing a very thorough investigation. We have been in constant contact with all the parties involved throughout the investigation. Just some color on our fan blades. We've got roughly 35,500 fan blades that support our fleet. We had inspected about 17,000 of those prior to the accident last week and we were on a path to complete the inspections of the remaining 18,500 by year-end and that would've meant the recommended service bulletin timelines. Since the accident, we accelerated those remaining inspections with a goal to have them complete in 30 days, and we completed inspections on about 8,500 of them at this point. And as Gary mentioned, we have had no findings of subsurface cracks. So, this is really \u2013 it's an all-hands on deck activity to work through the inspections, the investigation and to do a deep dive to understand what happened and why. And we're going to do everything we can to ensure it doesn't happen again. It has truly been a 24/7 around-the-clock effort, and I sincerely want to thank everyone involved for their thorough and their diligent and their committed work. So with that, Tammy, I'll turn it back to you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Mike. I'll turn now to the balance sheet and cash flow, and take you through that quickly here. Our liquidity is strong, and we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $3.2 billion. Operating cash flow was approximately $1 billion in first quarter and free cash flow was $708 million, allowing us to return $648 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our leverage is approximately 30%, in line with our leverage target, which is in the low- to mid-30% range. Based on our tweaks to our Boeing order book that we've already taken you through, our 2018 CapEx is expected to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range. Included in this total, we expect 2018 aircraft CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion and non-aircraft CapEx in the $800 million to $900 million range. We continue to effectively balance and manage our overall capital deployment, and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. We currently have $850 million remaining of our $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and we will continue to evaluate our investments in our company, our people and our shareholders, including the mix of share repurchases and dividends with an overarching goal to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We are benefiting from a lower corporate tax rate, and we continue to expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 23.5% range. Moving to a quick update on fleet, we had 11 deliveries during first quarter and we ended the quarter with 717 aircraft. As we've communicated, we're in a fleet deficit compared to midyear 2017 when we had around 735 aircraft before the retirement of the bulk of our -300 Classic fleet in third quarter 2017. And our fleet deficit will recede when we get into third quarter 2018. We will have significant 737-700 retirements over the next 10 to 15 years, and this order book refresh that we've covered with you in the earnings release, and that Gary also covered with you, along with our remaining order books and options, allows us to manage through our retirement and growth needs in a measured way. Aircraft CapEx remains very manageable at approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion per year on average for the next five years, and we'll end this year with 752 aircraft, and our capacity outlook for the full year has not changed and we continue to expect an increase in the low 5% range year-over-year. So in closing, our financial performance is off to a solid start for the year, and we're off to a good start to expand our net margin for 2018, excluding special items. And we are already realizing meaningful benefits of tax reform, and I am pleased that we can continue putting it to work by investing in our business, rewarding our hard working people, and giving back to our shareholders and keeping our costs and fares low for our customers. So with that overview, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time. Tammy, just quick point of clarification, you're talking about net margin expansion now. Last quarter we spoke, you had said EBIT margin expansion. Is there a change in the plan? Or am I just misinterpreting the comment? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hi, Hunter. No, you did not misinterpret the comment. And as we've acknowledged here for the first half of the year, we are off plan. So, obviously, in terms of margins, it will depend on how quickly we see our revenue trends recover here. And on the cost side is we feel pretty solid about that. And if you, in terms of fuel, we've got a great hedge in place, so that should be helpful on the fuel side. Certainly, when you take into the account of tax reform benefit from the lower tax rate, we feel good about our net margin goal. But we are not \u2013 I guess, I feel good about our progress towards that goal here in the first quarter. Our net margin, we're just off to a great start here year-over-year, and we will just have to see how it plays out on the cost of revenue side. But I feel real good about the revenue benefits that we have coming on here in the second half. I think we've covered those with you pretty extensively with respect to the reservation system. And so, really no change in our goal. We're just going to keep compounding away on the unit revenue side. So I think that's really the question mark for us here as we think about our outlook for the second quarter. But again, we feel real good about all of the help that we have coming online here over the second half. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then the incremental eight MAX 8s that are going to be coming in 2019 relative to the plan three months ago. Are those going to be offset by incremental -700 retirements? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, the order that we covered with you, yeah, those are for our fleet modernization efforts. So yes, that would be the intent. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, I would say, Hunter, that I'm just trying to recap my own little back-of-the-envelope math here, but there are some airplanes that are moving around absent this Boeing order from 2019 into 2018. So, I think we've covered that with you. And the number is ten, so there are ten additional firm deliveries in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. And casting this as part of our fleet modernization absolutely means that we are planning an equivalent number of -700 retirements for these additional 40 firm orders. Now, we've got flexibility in the fleet. We can choose not to do that. But that is what we are sharing with you today is that we have exercised 40, and however they fall, what we are telling you today is that we would offset those with retirements. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Gary, I think it's a testament to Southwest's safety culture and your long-term track record that you haven't had to engage in book-away analysis in the past. But since this isn't the type of analysis that you had to do until this past week, would you be willing to share just some of the more specific modeling assumptions that you embraced in identifying the lingering weakness in May? Is there some industry precedent that you're following? All I'm trying to do is get at how you conducted the actual analysis since, thankfully, this is not an area of analytical familiarity for Southwest, and I mean that, obviously, as a compliment. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, hey, Jamie. This is Tom. If you don't mind, I'm going to try and take that one, and I'll do the best I can for you (31:13). Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure, thanks guys. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: At this point, based on this morning, we are probably a little closer to 1 point versus 0.5 point. So, we're staying right on top of this thing. But it's not as though we haven't had other events that would draw traffic down, whether it was the technology outage or whether it was an event we had back in 2016. So, we do have some history with when we have a public event and people are aware, we see a dip in traffic and we generally see what it takes to bring it back up. So, that's kind of the basis for how we're thinking about this. But as I said, that's kind of the baseline. That's our analytic baseline, if you will. I think the other way we are trying to respond to this is we really do want to get our marketing back online with our paid search. And keep in mind, we are not running any TV or any social right now. The reason we're not doing that is because our TV and our social has a lot of personality, and it has a lot of fun. And we just don't think it's appropriate yet to bring that back up online. We're working really close with Linda Rutherford and her comps team, her social team, just listening for the sentiment, when does it feel appropriate for us to go back into the market, right? But just in terms of your direct question, we are going back and referencing prior events and what we saw happen with our traffic. And that's probably the best we have to go with at this point, but I do think 1% to 2% is probably reasonable based on what we are seeing thus far. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's excellent color. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, and I'll just add a couple other thoughts, just to be clear. We are continuing to see some weakness in our bookings, as Tom said. And as you expect and as we stated, we're currently running below our pre-accident run rate. And this is certainly understandable for all the reasons Tom's taken you through with respect to our marketing. And I'd just point out that that's very meaningful to our direct distribution model. So, as we return back to our normal marketing activities, we expect our trends to rebound. But admittedly, it is difficult to estimate the impact with precision. But we know we've already lost about a 1 point, as we pointed out in year-over-year RASM for the second quarter. So, based on that lost revenue, of course, it'd be tough to recover the loss in our close-in bookings, but we are hopeful that once marketing comes back online, we'll see those trends rebound. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood, and as a quick follow up, in the press release when you discussed the slot transaction, you mentioned that \"the new slots are going to complement our network.\" And I don't want to read too much into that, but you could've said grow our network. Does complement imply that you're only going to fly to existing Southwest cities with the new slots? Or is that just too cute of an interpretation? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, I think all we were basically trying to say is we have a strong network in those two cities that we're able to complement from LaGuardia and for Reagan. And that the main point was that we'll simply use our existing fleet, our existing capacity, and those new routes will be a part of the growth that you're already familiar with, so. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But both of those are still developing markets for Southwest, and we continue to tinker with frequencies and destinations, so I think yeah, I wouldn't necessarily read anything into the word complement. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate it, Gary. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Gary, do you still expect to be RASM positive this year? And if not, are you prepared to maybe adjust some schedules in off-peak flying in the back, call it, back third \u2013 back four months of the year in an effort to better match capacity with market demand? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well \u2013 and I know Tammy and Tom will have a view as to your question as well. I think that what is obvious is that we are off plan. Now, we've had an event, so I think in terms of my confidence level in telling you that I am X percent confident that we'll hit our goal, I think we all just have to admit that we're off our trend and we're going to have to regain our momentum here, which I'm very confident we will. I don't know exactly when, and I don't know exactly how much, and I don't know because of that what the end result will be. Now I would say personally and again, don't read too much into this, but it's just too close to call. So said a different way, it is not obvious at all that we cannot make it. But likewise, it's not obvious that we can either. So, the goal will continue to be positive unit revenue performance, and don't count us out is all I would say. The only other thing I wanted to add onto that is the margins are important, and Hunter asked the question to Tammy earlier, and I was just going to add onto that. It's basically the same answer there that I think we're pretty confident of the goal of having net margin growth for the year, but it's just a little too close to call that for the same reasons on the RASM side. So, I think a lot will depend on what happens on that answer to fuel prices, number one, which are up since the year started. And then, secondly, obviously, what happens on revenue. Tom, so what do you...? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Jack. This is Tom. Hey. First of all, I concur with what Gary just said. I also think, though, that we always look at how flights are performing. And we'll probably take a more stringent look at how the shoulder flying is performing in terms of profitability. And if it's not profitable, we will find a way to pull that back and redeploy the capacity elsewhere. But the flying that we are doing on our shoulder right now is in fact profitable; it's accretive. It may be RASM dilutive, but it's still very helpful to us. So, I don't think that you'd see us turning profit away just to improve a metric, right? Understanding your objective though, so that's kind of my take on it. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, I think what Tom is implying is that, clearly, we would prefer to move those shoulder flights back into the peak part of the day, and that's what we'll be able to do more and more as airplanes come online. And I agree with Tom; I think that is the best technique we've got to address your question here in the second half of the year. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. That's very helpful color. And then, for my follow-up, just a question on sort of new market development, could you remind us again sort of historically what's the timeframe to sort of get a new market once you start flying there to sort of system-level profitability or get it to where it's accretive from the time you enter it, I ask this in context to sort of kicking off the Hawaii flying, either late this year or early next year. Just how do you think that flying to Hawaii will ramp relative to sort of normal market development for you guys? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Those are two different questions. Let me take the first one. The first one is how long does it typically take us for markets to turn profitable. And when we connect markets where we serve and the customers know us, it's typically a three-month turn from initiation to profitability, or so. I'm sorry. I misspoke. Three years. I'm sorry? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Three years. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, yeah. Three years. So that's what we're seeing. In terms of Hawaii, I think that we're going to see a really nice ramp up very quickly, because the customers all know us in the West Coast. We have the largest customer base of airline on the West Coast. I think you're going to see it ramp up very, very quickly, and I think we're going to lead on pricing. I think that we're going to generate a lot of traffic very, very quickly. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, again. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Just to add onto what Tom said, agree with the three years. Normally, what we see for probably more of our international markets is three years, we'll see where Hawaii falls, but it really depends on the market. When you think about a market like Dallas Love Field, we saw that ramp up very quickly. That was probably about a year. And Hawaii, I think we're hoping that will ramp up very quickly here, given our significant presence in the West Coast. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, I agree. And then, Jack, you didn't ask this exactly, but our growth is very modest here in the first quarter year-over-year. And the percentage of markets that we call \"development\" is, I think, Tammy, 3%, or less. So, it's a very small component of the current system, number one. And so number two, that sort of sets us up well to undertake an expansion that we plan later on in the year, meaning that we don't have a lot of markets under development. And the other little factoid I was going to offer up is that the growth in our newest segment, i.e., international, year-over-year, is very modest. I want to say that's also sort of low- to mid-single digits. So, the system is maturing. We've got some revenue-enhancing techniques that are queued up and especially for the second half, and I think we'll be in a very good position to undertake the Hawaii launch. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Gary, Tom, Tammy, thank you very much for your answers. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Good afternoon. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Good afternoon. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Tom, a question or two for you as it relates to the benefits around the reservation system, can you just talk about the progression through the rest of the year and maybe specifically provide what those features that you're going to turn on are so that we can get some comfort there? And then as it relates to the impact around scheduling, what's the hit to 2Q RASM and apologies if you provided that already? And then where do you see the benefit in 3Q and 4Q being or any kind of color that you can provide to help us triangulate how to get there. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. Sure. Glad to do that. So the one res benefit, the primary one that we've been talking with you guys about is really this notion of O&D bid pricing capability or functionality. And I think you understand that, but what that does is it gives us the opportunity to maximize revenue by really optimizing the mix of non-stop and connecting passengers on the network. So, that's what we're trying to do there. And the old method, just by way of example, will focus more on optimizing the revenue at the flight level, so you'd optimize the flight but you're not optimizing at the itinerary level. So, that's what we're trying to do and that's where the value comes from the primarily $200 million a year. And when we deployed this, oh, gosh, kind of late Q1 or mid Q1, and we are starting to see \u2013 so the team is kind of tuning it, they're getting it going and we're seeing really nice benefits. We feel really good about that and we have a lot of confidence in what we have already signed up for, for the first half and for the full year. So, we feel very good about that. And Rajeev, tell me again, I really couldn't hear your second question, it was where's the margin enhancement coming from in the second half? Is that what you're asking? Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, it's on the scheduling, the scheduling impact to 2Q RASM and then what will the benefits start to be in the back half of the year? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, it's \u2013 yeah, Jack, it's \u2013 Rajeev, it's 1 point of benefit that we're expecting for 2Q, in terms of our year-over-year RASM. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And in 3Q? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'm sorry, penalty. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And will that accelerate through the end of the year (44:36)? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's well... Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: There's a 1 point penalty in the second quarter. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: There's a 1 point penalty in the second quarter. I thought I'd said penalty, so apologize for that. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then what is the benefit in 3Q and 4Q or in the back half of the year versus that 1 point penalty in 2Q? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: In the second half of the year, and again, for the second half of the \u2013 for the reservation benefit, just want to make sure, on the shoulder flying part. So that's going to \u2013 yeah, we just expect that to recede. We will have overlapped our fleet by the time we get to, say, October and so we should see that continue to recede as we go through the year. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And if I can ask Mike a quick question. In terms of \u2013 associated with the accident, have all your maintenance procedures been reviewed, et cetera, and you're all in good shape there, if that's appropriate to ask? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're asking if are all of our maintenance procedures in line with the service bulletin? Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Exactly. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. So we went back and we've been participating with GE and CFM since our first incident back in August of 2016. And so we have been lockstep with them on the service bulletins and the requirements through that. And at this point in time, it doesn't look like we have a compliance concern. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Sorry for the confusion, guys. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I would just add that the procedures that we're using are the same ones that were developed with CFM back in 2016, meaning that we do the ultrasonic inspection by removing the blade. And then our service provider, which is GE, when they do the overhaul, they do a more extensive eddy current inspection at that point. So the procedures themselves are unchanged. What is different now with the most recent service bulletin and air readiness directive is the frequency of doing those inspections. And as I reported earlier and Mike confirmed with his report, with the inspections that we have stepped up since last week, we've had no findings at this point, which is obviously what we would expect and obviously a positive. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. If I might follow up on the California strategy here, it seemed to me \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 that part of this strategy of defending your position has been to kind of pull forward the opportunities maybe that you were kind of planning for California and kind of strengthening your offering to the passengers there. So from an impact to unit revenue, should I think of that as more of a kind of a near-term thing? And is it fair to assume that as those markets develop that they should start to normalize? Or is this kind of a multiyear kind of fast-tracking growth? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I think it's the former. I think what you've got here is very typical. Whenever there is an expansion underway in a market, whether it's by us or by our competitors, there's going be some impact on unit revenue. And then it matures over time. And what you should expect is, all else being equal to be fair, that you would see improved unit revenue performance. And things are dynamic. So we'll tune, our competitors will tune, but absolutely this is \u2013 the way we're looking at it, these are opportunities that \u2013 there's an opportunity cost, if you will. So we know that we have opportunities to enhance our route system in the West for our customers, and at some point in time, we would attend to that. So perhaps your interpretation that perhaps we're accelerating a bit, I don't quarrel with that. But I would also point out that while Tom was highlighting California, it's really as an example. The Southwest performance is not just California. We've got competitive situations all over the country. And considering how competitive it is, and I think Tom said this, it's performing very well. But we're not going to add this much capacity and have competitors adding this much capacity and not see some kind of a unit revenue impact. I think the only time in my memory that that has ever happened was the Love Field expansion. And I think everybody knows how unique that was. But it was almost instantly \u2013 well, it was instantly profitable and with nary an impact on unit revenues. That was remarkable. But that is clearly the exception. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. And if I may, just a clarification on the 2018 capacity growth. How much of that is \u2013 can get skewed around on the timing of kind of the launch of Hawaii? Was Hawaii always kind of expected to be at the very end of the year and therefore not a meaningful driver of the kind of 2018 capacity? Or depending on when Hawaii actually gets launched, could that capacity move around in the second half? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, I think that's right. I think that our best opportunity that we've been planning towards would be pretty deep into the year. So I think that you nailed it. Your thought is spot on. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So that it wouldn't have an impact. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, it's not going to be a massive impact. It just depends on when we get our \u2013 first of all, you have to understand, we're still going through our certification process with the FAA and ETOPS. We've been saying \u2013 we just announced to those cities today, but we've been saying we sure want to be able to sell this year. And now we're saying, we sure want to be able to fly this year. It just really depends upon the ETOPS certification. I think what you'll see is part of the ETOPS certification is you can't start with a full schedule. You have to kind of grow your way into it and demonstrate proficiency with the FAA and that kind of thing. So I think the back half of the year, late in the year, I would love for us to be flying Hawaii. But I don't think it's going to have a significant impact on our capacity. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So in other words, right now we've reserved airplanes for these flights. We haven't told you exactly what we're planning because we can't commit to an exact date yet. And then I think if we don't fly Hawaii later on this year, then the question becomes what do we do with those airplanes, and I think that answer will be dependent upon when we know that and what our options are at the time. So I think Tom was trying to give you the most honest answer possible. It could have some impact on our capacity, but in theory it wouldn't. If we're not flying in Hawaii with those airplanes, we'll fly somewhere else where we have an opportunity. It just depends on when we know that and how productive we think that move off of Hawaii would be. But right now, we're obviously hoping that those airplanes are going to Hawaii. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That's great color. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. I guess just two questions here. Gary, it looks like JetBlue is going to scale back Long Beach by about a third. And so, obviously, free up slots. I know you're now in that market. Is that a market that you feel like it's sufficiently served? Or would you be interested in growing your Long Beach presence? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. Tom and I agree that we have been hobbled by not being able to have more access to Long Beach. We have a very modest operation there, so that's welcome news. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then just my second question, and this is Gary or Tom. Just the engines through this inspection process, as I recall, I believe and I could be wrong in this that you did have maybe power-by-the-hour agreements. And I'm just wondering does, if you do, does that cover some of the costs, mitigate some of the cost impact of these extensive blade checks? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Mike, you want to speak to that? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, sure. Yeah, we have our \u2013 engines are on two different types of agreements. We have some of them that are on this kind of power-by-the-hour, as you say, and then the others are on time and material. This particular airplane with our 700s are on time and material \u2013 excuse me, on power-by-the-hour. And so, yeah, that does help us mitigate the cost of those because the risk transfer is back to the GE, our service provider there. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Mike, do you have an early sense on what that potential cost could be in the quarter for Southwest, even the fact that you do have some protection there? I mean, are we talking, is it millions of dollars? Is it hundreds of thousands of dollars? Or is it just too early? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: It is a little early, but I would expect it to be in the millions of dollars, just to give you an idea directionally. And in terms of what would actually hit our CASM-ex line, there's some capital costs involved with that. But, again, we've given you our best guess as to what the cost implications would be within the guidance that we've provided. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: And those would be mostly outside of actually the engine repair costs. That would be over time those kinds of things. The labor costs associated with doing the inspections, some other delay remodeling (55:52) costs, those kinds of things. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Operator : We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Gary, on capital allocation, you've got capital to allocate in lots of different ways. I'm just wondering how you think about M&A versus other alternatives. You have some experience there. Are there cyclical considerations or other considerations? How do you think about that in the current environment? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Duane, I think it's very fair to say that our primary focus is investing in Southwest Airlines. This year in particular we've got a lot of our major strategic initiatives behind us. There's always work to do. But, in particular, here in 2018 and my hope is 2019 and 2020, we're really focused on the quality and the cost-effectiveness of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service, those very basic things. We want to continue to grow the airline. We've got wonderful opportunities to grow. And the tax reform, obviously, is a nice little boost to our sources of financing. So there's no imperative that we need to be hunting for an acquisition. I think that that's different than where we were in the late 2000s; 2009, 2010. And clearly this is our priority is just to grow organically. Having said that, we've always got to have our eyes open and be thinking about how we can improve shareholder value, and if there is a good opportunity in our view, it's something that we'll take a look at. We're always thinking about that, but admittedly that is not a focus and clearly not a focus right now. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Very good. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Of the $200 million from the new revenue management and reservation system that you said is going to come through this year, have you said how much of that is embedded in your second quarter guidance? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, Tom, we did. We said between $40 million and $50 million. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: $40 million and $50 million. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...was attributed to the second quarter. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: And our target is to get to $200 million for the run rate in the year. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on Rajeev's question. If I think about your fleet this year on a seat basis, it looks like you're going to average about 115,000 seats in the fleet, which is 2.5% to 3% higher than last year. If I consider that within the context of your low 5% ASM growth guidance, it implies something like 200 basis points of incremental utilization this year versus last. And that number looks to me to be pretty steady in quarters one through three and then stepping up in the fourth quarter based on the acceleration of your capacity growth that's implied by your guidance in the fourth quarter. And I guess when I try to think about the RASM headwind that you've called out from suboptimal time of day flying, I guess I think that that's something that should be more or less correlated with the year-over-year increase in your utilization rate. So can you just sort of reconcile the dynamic with the utilization versus what you're saying on the RASM hit from off-peak flying sort of fading as we make our way through the year? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I'll go first here. The answer is no. I'm not necessarily following all the puts and takes that you're describing. And my recollection, without having studied that this morning is that our utilization for this year is \"very normal.\" And we pushed the fleet pretty hard in the fourth quarter last year. So my recollection is that the absolute utilization of block hours and all those kind of basic things that we used to look at is very normal in the second half of the year and especially the fourth quarter. So why don't you let our IR folks take that one offline and we can be sure that we're following your question. The gauge is increasing because of the classic \u2013 all these things I know you know, but that's increasing. The stage length right now as I recall is down a bit. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's down. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So the trips are doing what the trips are doing. And so anyway, I just don't have of all that in front of me, and I think it would be easiest to take that offline if that is okay. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, sir. Operator : We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Gary, it feels like the last couple of quarters have been pretty un-Southwest-like. The revenue side hasn't met expectations that there's a little bit of CASM creep this year. Can you just talk about \u2013 obviously, some of this is outside of your control, but a lot of it is in your control, I think. Can you just talk about why you think this has happened and what gives you confidence that you can get back on track in the near future? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, I think it's a fair question. I don't know that I would agree that it is so un-Southwest-like. I think sometimes we do get spoiled by how good our performance is. It's just been \u2013 I think in retrospect, it's been a challenge to go through this fleet transition. And it's also been a challenge in the same year to roll out a brand new reservation system. So I think it's more timing than it is absolute execution. I think the third thing that I would put in there, and these are things again that we're focused on. So the third thing that I would say that we're focused on is just the competitive fair environment. And we've already made some enhancements to our revenue management techniques in the first quarter I think to better manage in that kind of environment. So those are the three. I think the route system itself is very strong. We're continuing to optimize it as time goes by, understanding that right now the length of the airplane day is too long. I just mean which cities are we in, flying to, which other destinations. That process has been really sound and especially over the last several years. So all of that looks really good to me. The international expansion looks really solid, and those markets are showing very dramatic improvement as they are \"developing and reaching maturity.\" So I think we just have some fairly significant things that we're managing through. It's not an apology. I'd kind of go back to my opening comments. When we know that it wasn't our best revenue performance, we still had a really good quarter and are very well positioned to finish this year very strong. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But I understand your point. We get it here, and any time we have a plan and we miss it, we aren't happy with ourselves. So I can assure you that we're not saying that this is satisfactory. In that sense, we're never satisfied. But on the whole, I think it's still a very solid performance. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And some of my other questions got asked, so I'll go with this one. The disclosures that you guys provide around the Chase agreement continue to be kind of the worst in the industry. So I'm just wondering if you could address that. And then, secondly, can you appreciate that the market and the investment community may like to know more about a business where you essentially take a cut of every dollar spent on the Southwest Chase credit card? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. I'll be happy to provide a little more information for you since you asked today. So just to kind of help you understand economics a little bit better, if you look at our passenger revenues and other revenues related to Rapid Rewards, approximately $490 million of our passenger revenues were attributable to Rapid Rewards redemptions. And most of our revenue, other revenue, which I believe we've pointed out before, relates to our partner revenue associated with Rapid Rewards. So overall, we're continuing to see a nice growth in our Rapid Rewards program, and for the first quarter that grew in excess of our capacity growth. So that should give you little more insight on the revenues, and we'll be providing more robust disclosures for you once we get our 10-Q filed. And then just to help you on the balance sheet a little bit. $1.8 billion of our roughly $4 billion \u2013 I think it's $4.4 billion air-traffic liability, the current portion of that on the balance sheet relates to Rapid Rewards. So when you add that amount to the $1 billion of noncurrent ATL related to Rapid Rewards that you see on the balance sheet, you'll get a total air traffic liability balance related to Rapid Rewards of $2.8 billion. So roughly half of our total ATL when you add \u2013 when you look at both the current and noncurrent portions relates to Rapid Rewards. So I hope that helps you in your analysis. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Gary, can you understand why the market would maybe want to know more about that business? I'm just interested in your perspective on it. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I'd be happy to share my perspective. And again, I'm certainly deferring to Tammy to guide us as to what our requirements are, and we'll meet whatever requirements we have for disclosure. And I don't mean this in a harsh way at all, but you ranking us last doesn't move me at all. I think what we have to balance is, first of all, our function here is called investor relations. And I'll bet, you give them high marks. I think they bend over backwards to meet our investors' needs. And that's kind of very much the spirit of Southwest Airlines. At the same time, we're slugging it out with competitors every single day, and there are things I do not want them to know. I don't want them to know how we manage our revenues and that would include the Chase component, consider all of these things \u2013 well, many of these things to be proprietary. So that's the only reason. We're not trying to hide anything from our investors, per se. But I think you understand that investors also aren't loyal to Southwest. They own our competitors. So we have the duty of protecting Southwest, and we guard that very jealously. But that is the only reason that we wouldn't provide more information because we don't want our competitors to know, and so we'll continue to make judgments about what will meet your needs and also meet the companies' needs. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Gary. And I wasn't trying to insult Investor Relations by any means. I just think more color on that side of the business could help sentiment and the multiple on the stock. I think that's pretty clear. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, no, I don't think anybody feels insulted. You ask a fair question and I hopefully at least gave you a reason why we just don't open up the whole general ledger. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for getting me in at the end. So, Gary, I'll just ask one, and I think you even alluded to it. If you can't get the Hawaii flying off the ground, you'll find somewhere else to put the aircraft in the back half of the year. But the reality is fuel prices have come up quite a bit since we've had that plus 7% capacity growth outlook out there. And this is an issue for your competitors as well, but costs go up and revenue is not tracking, so everyone's being asked as an investor do believe it's different this time. We're going to offset fuel. But no one's taking that proactive step yet to really reflect that reality. So are we just looking at fuel prices that are too volatile and not thinking long term? Or how should investors expect fuel volatility to maybe come out of this? Or is that just something we have to live with? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, let me give it a try and you redirect if I'm not hitting your point. But first of all, these are phenomenal financial results. After being in the business for four decades, I'll take this year over the vast majority of the years that I've been working in the industry. So these are really, really good results. We are very well positioned from a couple of perspectives with our fuel hedging as well as the really prosperous margins that we have, the cost outlook we have in other areas and the revenue outlook that we have. I think we're very well positioned to manage our way through a real fuel price shock. What we have now is not an issue. If we get to $100-plus a barrel, then I think we have something else to talk about. But I'll just repeat, which I hope will sum it up, what our goals are. Our goals are to have every year positive unit revenue performance. And in addition to that, perhaps more importantly, we want margin expansion. So when fuel prices go down, the industry doesn't seem to get much credit for margin expanding. And likewise, I think we all need to recognize that margins will be impacted somewhat when fuel prices go up. So if fuel escalates more rapidly, clearly that would put more pressure on us to also have our revenues cover that. That won't happen in a quarter. And one of the tools that we would have to look to would be the schedule. But I think Tom made the point on an \u2013 I would just say as an analogy, we're still better off flying these shoulder flights because they are profitable and at the margin, they add profits as compared to simply not flying it. So fuel prices would have to be looked at in the same way. If we were not able to raise fares, would that immediately lead to a decision to stop flying some of our airplanes? Well, not if they're still profitable. So I think a lot of this just depends. But again, the bottom line is we're very motivated. We're very motivated to generate shareholder returns, which means we'll need to continue to drive unit revenue growth, but the prize is to continue to generate very, very strong margins and aspire to margin growth. We've got net income margins, which we have a shot at this year to grow significantly. I'm happy. I think it's a very good environment, and at least we're well-positioned to have to manage our way through a somewhat higher fuel cost environment. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate it, Gary. Operator : And that concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Tom, thank you very much. We can go ahead and get started with the media portion of our call today, if you'll give them some instructions to queue up for questions. Operator : Yes, ma'am. . And, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our first question, our question comes from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. So my question is just regarding \u2013 and I understand this NTSB is still involved in looking at the accident from 2016 with the engine failure. I'm wondering if there's any color or comment you guys can provide about what the conversations were like with CFM International in the months following that, and what level of risk was expressed around those fan blades. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Mike, maybe I can start and you can correct it. But, well, I think that there was, first of all, surprise that a fan blade would fail, and then also surprised that the inlet cowl would \u2013 it would fail in such a way that it would destroy the inlet cowl. So that immediately led to the realization that we needed to increase the inspections. So GE actually does the engine maintenance, not CFM, Mike, I believe. So GE increased their \u2013 they changed their inspection technique. They do our overhaul work, Conor, which has to happen before 20,000 cycles. And they changed their inspection technique to the eddy current. And then, Southwest, working with CFM, also implemented the ultrasonic examination. And we were doing that initially on the \u2013 just in layperson's terms, we were identifying the older blades in our fleet and examining those first, and then, ultimately, by the end of 2017 decided that we would inspect every single blade in our fleet every time that we touched it for our maintenance step in between the overhaul, and that is every 3,000 cycles. And by the way, that is what you now see the service bulletin by CFM and then the Airworthiness Directive by the FAA has evolved essentially to that. So, well, I beg your pardon. I think it's just the service bulletin by CFM. So I think the short answer is I thought their response was appropriate. It was aggressive and we'll continue to work with the manufacturer to improve the blades so that, in essence, the inspections aren't necessary. But again, you look at what Mike reported earlier and what I did, with all the blades that we've examined, you just don't find any cracks in these blades. I think we found one previous to 2017, and that blade, of course, was discarded. But just very, very few failures, but we'll continue to work with both Boeing and GE to improve those engines. In the meantime, we'll make sure there are no blades on engines that have fatigue in them. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, Conor, you also, just in that first event back in 2016, the engine, the worldwide fleet of those engines probably had north of 300 million flight hours on it, and that is the first time in the history of that engine that they had that kind of an event. And so I thought that GE and CFM, I thought they were very aggressive on trying to understand what happened there and whether or not it was just an anomaly or that it was some type of age or other type of issue. And so I agree with what Gary said. So they focused on inspection techniques, they were needing improvements to inspection techniques, there was an introduction of the ultrasonic inspection, there was a drive to look at older engines, then into certain part numbers, and then into this most recent service bulletin that I think is very comprehensive. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And we'd be happy to take you through that in more detail because there have been \u2013 there is confusion, there have been now three service bulletins by CFM and, Mike, I think that they probably supersede the previous one, in effect, but that's confusing. The FAA was working on a proposed rulemaking asking for comment during 2017 while we were already doing these inspections. So that has never been issued in that form. Instead, the FAA came out with an Emergency Airworthiness Directive last Friday, which we will do all the incremental inspections required by that very easily before their deadline. I think we'll want to work with them to agree that we are in compliance with all the other engines that we have inspected, things like that. But the stepped-up inspections are necessary. I think we're doing them at a very quick interval, and it's just to make darn sure that we don't have any blades on engines that have a crack in them. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alana Wise with Reuters. Alana Wise - Reuters: Hi. Thanks so much, everyone, for taking my question. So this is something that I think has been a little bit unclear throughout the course of this whole thing, but prior to the blowout on Tuesday, had the engine involved been inspected as part of the 2016 look into this class of engines? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, that was made clear. That engine was not inspected. And the reason is because it did not meet the criteria that the manufacturer had established for inspection. It was due for the inspection this year. So it was on, again, it was on the schedule to be inspected, but just had not been inspected by April. So what, of course we have done since last Tuesday is we said we are going to inspect every engine in the fleet, meaning every blade in the fleet, either since 2016 or over the next month. And then we will have a baseline, and we will be inspecting those every 3,000 cycles from that point forward. So hopefully all those moving parts made sense to you. Alana Wise - Reuters: Fantastic. Thanks so much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Except for your question, the engine had been through all of its required inspections and overhauls, et cetera, so it was fully up to date in terms of its maintenance. It just had not been inspected for this current matter yet. So again, it would've been later this year. Alana Wise - Reuters: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Hi. Thanks. Gary, I wanted to ask, because you said there'd been one previous cracked blade found before 2017. Can you say when that was? And then my second question is maybe for Mike. You said you haven't found any fatigue or cracks, but have you found anything else in the blade inspections that you guys thought was unusual or noteworthy or anything at all? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, Mary, I'll start, so yeah, we all do the blade inspections, and I wouldn't say we found anything noteworthy. You see normal coating, maybe the normal mix you would find on fan blades with foreign object debris, things like that. So as we found those in these inspections, we have replaced those blades. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: And then back on your question on \u2013 the comment that Gary had, it had a crack in it, that was part of some work that we were doing with GE, and it was back in May of 2017. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. So it was after the 26th incident? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Right, it was part of the inspection processes that we were going through and found that blade. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And I think we have about 36,500 blades. And so out of all those blades, we found one. And so obviously, now we know that there will be blades with cracks in them. So there's nothing so extraordinary about that, but it is at least hopefully comforting to know that there was only one that was found with the inspections that were done. So now the point being, we'll just have to keep up with all the blades in the fleet with very frequent inspections with an abundance of caution to make sure that that doesn't slip through. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. And if I can double check on the number, you said 36,500. I thought Mike earlier said 35,500. But maybe I just misheard. The total number of ... Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's 35,500. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : 35,000. Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: As usual, Mike is right. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Thank you very much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs - CNBC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You, Mike, had said earlier that a fan blade itself isn't capable of causing so much damage. Are there any tests you're doing, or CFM is recommending to test the cowling or how stable it is or something like that? And my second question, are you speaking or working on any training with the flight attendants? I know there was a lot of commentary about people using oxygen masks wrong, just about how to ensure the passengers are following along with the safety briefings? Thanks. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Just a couple of things. First of all, in terms of engines and engine design, the engines are frequently tested with respect to a fan blade failure and having those contained inside the engine and in the engine cowling. The cowling that we're talking about now is an inlet cowl, so it's a before \u2013 it conducts airflow into the engine, and so it's before the containment part of that. And that's what we're talking about is whether or not there are opportunities in the inlet cowl to improve its durability so that it can minimize the kind of energy that comes out with this fan blade release. In terms of the flight attendants, actually one of the great things about social media is that you do get a good view of what is going on inside the cabin. And we absolutely will look and try to learn from things that we can do better, make our customers more safe, make sure that the training and the communication out into the cabin is adequate. And as a matter of fact, the NTSB has set up a group to kind of study the in-cabin services, so I know that they'll do a thorough investigation of that and may come out with some good recommendations. Leslie Josephs - CNBC: Since that incident, since the 1380, they've done that? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Who's that? The NTSB? Leslie Josephs - CNBC: Yeah. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, that's part of the 1380, that's part of the investigation, they're looking at the onboard in-cabin activities. Leslie Josephs - CNBC: Okay. But you're not working on anything specifically just yet? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: We're supporting them in that effort. Leslie Josephs - CNBC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Good morning. I have two questions. One, can you give us, either Tammy or Gary or somebody, a dollar figure associated with the bookings hit from flight 1350? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I think what Tammy and Tom were talking about earlier was 1 to 2 points or percent of second quarter revenues, so do you have that off the top of your head? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: An absolute number? It's in the $35 million to $40 million range. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, (1:27:43). Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Perfect, thank you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: It's just a rough ballpark. It's $50 million to \u2013 if you just do the math, and it's a wide range, so we were kind of going in the middle, it's going to be at least a $50 million impact and, if you just do the math, it's $50 million to $100 million. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. And one more question unrelated to that, for Tom on the ETOPS certification in Hawaii. I'm no ETOPS expert, but when you were just mentioning, you were talking about, through this process you might be able to start small with Hawaii as you're going through the process. Can you give us any more color on that? I just wasn't aware that was an option as you go through. I thought that you had to get your certification and then the service began. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh no, once we get the certification, we will begin service. So I think the question is when will we get the certification. We're hoping to get it sometime later this year. But in terms of our scheduling, Gary announced the four cities via the four airports we intend to serve. Our network planning team certainly has laid out, here's what we would see the schedule being. It's not time for us to announce that, but when we do start service, it will be smaller, and it will begin to ramp up over time, I would think. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Okay. I must've misunderstood what you said then. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, but in other words, Dawn, it's always been our intention to start modestly, like with probably one city pair and focus that way, and then we would like ultimately to those four airports that we announced today. Obviously, that's our committed plan to serve all four. What we've not announced is what routes and when we'll start, and which one we'll start with. But we've always intended and the FAA has always understood that we'll start modestly. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: And when you say modestly, with that one city pair. Is that your goal for this year, if you are able to pull it off this year? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: I mean, on the first day, I think it would be probably one city pair. And part of that, I think in fairness to us, is to be determined in working with the FAA. But that's kind of the idea that you ought to be thinking about. Now I don't see us serving just one city pair for very long, and I'd rather not say how short just yet. But yeah, I think we're definitely planning to start very modestly. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Hi. Thanks. I know it's getting late. I have two questions, but the first is kind of to clarify what Mike said earlier and then Gary followed up on. So if I heard Mike correctly, you've inspected, it sounds like, 25,500 or so of your 35,500 blades. So that would mean you've got, what about 10,000 left to inspect and you're going to do those in the 30-day window. Are those all newer second-generation blades? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, we've been focused mostly on our 700 fleet, David. So yeah, so the lion's share of what's remaining really is the 800 fleet, and those should be \u2013 we just started taking the 800s five or six years ago, so generally speaking, yeah, those would be the newer-generation blades. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But I think, David, we started with going back to 2016, the oldest blades, then we worked out within Southwest and with CFM, the oldest engines. And so the focus has been on engines since then, knowing that blades move around between engines. So by accelerating all the inspections to within the next 30 days from last week, we will have covered every single engine regardless of the age of the blade. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Right. Okay. Great. Well, that leads into the other question I had, which was whether you ever considered grounding any planes, like maybe those with engine cycles, with the most engine cycles either new or since their last shop visit? Was that ever under thought? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Based on all the... Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: After, yeah. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...evidence that we have, based on discussions with CFM, Boeing, the FAA, the NTSB, that wasn't a consideration because of the accelerated inspection cycle and just the history and the data that we have on these fan blades. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, at this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you all very much. If you have any follow-up questions, please do reach to our Communications team. You can get them at 214-792-4847 or via our media website at www.swamedia.com. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you for joining.",

My name is Laurie and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on the southwest.com Investor Relations section. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Laurie, and I want to welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'm sure you've seen our earnings release this morning and on today's call we'll share more insights about our second quarter performance, as well as our outlook, and then open it up for questions. Before we get started, please note that we will make reference to forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current intent, expectations, and projections, and a variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different. This call will also include references to non-GAAP results. These results exclude special items, so please reference the Investor Relations section of southwest.com to find this morning's press release and our SEC filings for more information regarding both forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everybody and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer, has also joined us and you will be hearing from Tom, Mike, and Tammy, so I'm going to be very brief. Given the challenges in the quarter, our people did an exceptional job and produced exceptional results, and I am very grateful to them, I'm very grateful for them and, just at the outset, I really want to thank them. I'm very proud of what our people produced. We produced record earnings per share. From what I've seen, Southwest produced the strongest operating and net margins in the domestic industry, and that is despite our second quarter challenges. We benefited from federal income tax reform, but even that wasn't quite enough to offset the fuel price increases. But once again our people did a great job, as we were under-budget in virtually every other cost category. It feels like the business effects of the April accident are behind us. Our folks did a tremendous job of regenerating booking momentum; close-in yields are strong. We're recovering strongly in third quarter relative to the second quarter, and especially if you take into account the increasing stage length and aircraft gauge. Fourth quarter bookings are also strong, although it's still a good ways out, and the nice thing is that fourth quarter has no headwinds, aside from the usual economic or competitive issues. I want to personally thank Tom and Mike and Tammy for their stellar and steady leadership. And at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Tom to provide an overview of the business, and Mike is going to cover operations, and Tammy is going to wrap it up with cost and financial recap. So, Tom, over to you, sir. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everybody. Well, as you know, and Gary has covered some of this, our second quarter got off to a very tough start. Having said that, though, our teams did work very hard and they fought through a lot of uncertainty. We ended quarter with record operating revenues of $5.7 billion, which is up slightly year-over-year. Our second quarter RASM decreased 3% from last year, which is right in line with our guidance, and our load factor was down about 1 point from last year at 84.7%. But even with a decline in our load factor, we carried over 35 million revenue passengers in the quarter, which, by the way, did record number of customers for Southwest for any quarter. The revenue impact of Flight 1380 was 2 points of RASM, which is roughly a $100 million reduction in passenger revenues. We re-launched our broader marketing efforts, including full digital and television, with our May 15 summer travel fare sale. And at this point, I'd say that our marketing is fully back to normal. As you know, a fare sale for summer travel is very, very unusual for us, but the sole purpose was to get back in front of our customers, get traffic back to southwest.com, and re-stimulate bookings at attractive price points to make up for some of the lost ground, and we did that. The sale was very targeted driving travel in June through October, and it focused primarily on Tuesday and Wednesday travel, and we're very careful to preserve close-in yield opportunities with a 21-day advance purchase requirement. And the sale worked just as designed and it did help stabilize our passenger revenue trends. Our yields for the second quarter were down 2.5%, but we saw this begin to stabilize in late May. And over the past two months, we've seen our yields strengthen considerably, and I'll talk more about that in just a moment. And, of course, our revenue management team, well, they did an incredible job and they delivered incredible results under a very, very difficult set of circumstances. I do want to thank you guys. I suspect you're listening to the call and thank you for that. We did see very meaningful revenue benefits in the second quarter from our O&D revenue management systems, or bid pricing as it's called, and that was a key driver of our $35 million res system benefit in the second quarter. We're also using an array of other pricing techniques and tools behind the scenes. Our new res system is allowing us to manage our inventory and pricing with much greater granularity, and all these new capabilities are enabling us to better manage our low-fare offerings, in particular in competitive markets. In terms of our ancillary revenue performance, we had a really good quarter. Our EarlyBird product had another strong performance in Q2, as did our upgraded boarding product, both of which were up strong double digits year-over-year, despite a slightly lower load factor. I'm also very pleased with the strength and growth of our Rapid Rewards Program, which is outpacing our capacity growth. And we're also very pleased with our business partner revenues. The combination of these two things were the primary drivers of the 10.4% increase of the revenues. And our credit card portfolio also continues to perform well and growth in new card members and credit card spend were both up double digits for the quarter. And, of course, we continue to see great traction in growing our West Coast Rapid Rewards members and cardholder base, which aligns very nicely with our entry into Hawaii. And as you're probably aware, we launched a new credit card last week and that strengthens our frequent flier program even more. On our last call, I talked about the impact that our sub-optimal schedule had on RASM due to increased shoulder flying. And as expected, this was about a 1 point drag on our Q2 RASM. You'll see this begin to recede in Q3 as our fleet builds back up to nearly pre-Classic retirement levels. So when you net out the temporary items, the 2 point RASM impact from Flight 1380 and the 1 point impact from the sub-optimal schedule, I feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and how we've rebounded since April 17. Let's now talk about third quarter. So we expect our third quarter RASM to be in the range of flat to up or down 1% year-over-year. So let me start off with a few moving parts in Q3 that I want to talk through before reporting on our base business trends. First and foremost, again, we are very pleased with the performance of our commercial initiatives that were enabled by our new reservation system and we remain confident in our plan to deliver $200 million in EBIT value this year on new reservation system. For Q3, we expect a $70 million to $80 million benefit, the majority of which is driven primarily by improved O&D revenue management, and this equates to a 1.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM. Second, as you might expect, the summer travel fare sale had an overall dilutive impact to yield, overall (8:43) booking curve and we estimate that it will negatively impact third quarter revenue by $30 million, or a little more than 0.5 point of third quarter RASM. The good news here is that we don't see any material revenue impact from 1380 beyond Q3. We're continuing to see very positive signs of our recovery and a continued strength of the Southwest brand. Third, our flight schedule in Q3 is still somewhat suboptimal, but the headwinds begin to subside in August as the percentage of shoulder flying begins to decrease as we overcome our fleet deficit. The schedule impact in Q3 improved sequentially from Q2, but is still about 0.5 point drag on Q3 RASM, and this penalty should subside wholly by Q4. Finally, in our March 8-K filing, we called out that we needed to recast some prior period items to reflect several accounting changes, one of which was specifically related to our Rapid Rewards Program. The primary changes that we now account for are loyalty points at fair market value rather than incremental cost, and the net effect of this was an increase to our third quarter 2017 RASM and this creates a 1 point year-over-year RASM headwind to our third quarter for this year. This is purely for accounting purposes and the impact is largely isolated to Q3. So we have several moving parts here in Q3, but when you adjust for the onetime items, the summer fare sale, the sub-optimal schedule, and the accounting adjustment, we feel very good about the strength of our base business. We are, in fact, seeing sequential yield improvements in the third quarter and we're seeing very good momentum with close-in yields, in particular in June and July. Although the higher yields will put some pressure on our load factor, we're seeing solid demand across the booking curve and we're seeing particular strength in close-in demand. And as we announced in June, we've taken action on the capacity side as well and we've reduced our fourth quarter capacity plan by 2 points. We're also continuing to take aircraft deliveries and we'll be out of our fleet deficit position by the end of the third quarter. And finally, we continued to prepare for our launch of Hawaii service and our ETOPS work continues to be on track, and we're ready to serve Hawaii once we receive the necessary approvals. And lastly, I'd like to share just a few thoughts on the fourth quarter as well. And you all know this, but we've been working through a lot of headwinds, onetime headwinds, over the past two quarters, second and third quarters, and Flight 1380 and suboptimal schedule and fleet deficits, it's been difficult and it's been challenging, but we have produced very, very solid results. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, I'm really excited about the fourth quarter, because it will be a clean comparison. Our fleet deficit issues go away. The sub-optimized schedule goes away. The effect of 1380 will be largely behind us, and the momentum that we are feeling is real and it's tangible and it's building. I feel very good about what we're seeing in terms of the business trends. We're seeing solid demand. We're seeing strength in yields and the quality of our schedule continues to improve. So having said that, our focus, of course, is to ensure that we bring in a very strong third and fourth quarter. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Mike. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Tom. Well, as you all know, the operation really picks up steam in the second quarter as summer travel gets into full swing. And we operate over 4,000 weekday flights during the quarter and we carry almost 400,000 customers a day over the period, so that's all Southwest Airlines. We don't spread any of that over partners or regional providers, and I don't believe any other carrier alone comes close to that kind of volume. So I am very proud of our team, our people, our frontline. They are warriors out there. They care about our customers. They care about each other. And there were certainly strong headwinds that they had to lean into to deliver a very solid operating performance in the second quarter. Of course, Tom's already mentioned that the primary headwind was the acceleration of our fan blade inspection program. So we accelerated our program prior to issuance of any mandatory inspection protocols, and we completed inspections on about 17,000 fan blades in 30 days. We also in May had 17 aircraft out of service for about a week as a result of a really freak hailstorm over a small section of our gate area in Denver. So both of those items reduced the amount of aircraft we had available to fly for scheduled service. And that, plus really the normal summer of thunderstorms, put us in operational recovery mode for really a large part of the second quarter. And despite all those headwinds, our on-time performance improved about 0.5 point from last year. So we had about 77% of our flights arrive within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival, and that's a little lower than what I would like, but it's closer to about 81% within 20 minutes. So even with all of those unexpected challenges, we didn't really suffer from lengthy delays. The bag handling for the second quarter was the best in our history, and roughly 99.7% of our bags were flying on the flights that they were tagged to be on. And by the way, that's a complementary free of charge service from Southwest Airlines. We also had the lowest ratio of customer complaints from the DOT this year as compared to the same timeframe in 2017. And just as a reminder, we were the best in the industry in 2017, so again improvements in that area. So my point is that despite very challenging operational headwinds, our people delivered a solid travel experience for our customers, and they did that with a very respectable cost performance for the quarter. Our ETOPS certifications, as Tom mentioned, are progressing. We have our application filed with the FAA and it's under review. We are flying domestic simulation flights using our proposed processes, and we're working with the FAA to amend and adjust those processes as are necessary. And once our procedures are approved, we can begin our training programs, work toward validation flights, and all of those things require a tremendous amount of work and coordination between Southwest Airlines and the FAA, and both of our engagement teams are working hard together every day. So we've previously announced our U.S. gateway cities of San Diego, Oakland, San Jose, and Sacramento, and Hawaii destinations of Lihue and Maui and Honolulu and Kona, and we just remain focused on that effort. So with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Right. Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Moving right into cost, I am pleased with our second quarter unit cost performance. Our CASM ex-special items was up only 1.5% year-over-year, with the biggest driver, of course, being higher fuel. Our economic fuel price per gallon increased 11% year-over-year to $2.21, which was in-line with our guidance. This included about $0.02 net benefit from hedging gains of $0.08, offset by $0.06 of fuel hedge premium costs. For third quarter, based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.25. Similar to second quarter, this includes an estimated $0.07 hedging gain and $0.06 of fuel hedge premium costs. While we're never happy about higher fuel prices, the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives over the past few years has us well prepared for the 40% year-over-year increase in market prices. With hedging losses well behind us and a strong hedge in place for this year, as well as next, we are well-positioned to manage through fuel price headwinds. At current levels, we are recognizing modest net hedging gains and, as a reminder, our fuel hedge kicks in more significantly at Brent crude prices $80 per barrel and above. So, I feel very good about our fuel hedge portfolio. We have meaningful protection as prices move up and will move down with the market as crude prices decline. I'm also pleased with our continued fuel efficiency gains from fleet modernization, including the retirement of our Classics. Our second quarter available seat mile per gallon, our key fuel efficiency metric improved by 1.7% year-over-year. Through the first half of the year, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly trailing our 2018 goal of 2% to 3%, primarily due to our utilization of the 700s to cover our fleet deficit and sub-optimal flight schedule. I expect to see momentum in our fuel efficiency as our schedule becomes more optimized in fourth quarter and beyond, coupled with the increasing mix of MAX aircraft in our fleet. Excluding fuel, our second quarter cost performance was better than expected, primarily due to timing. Our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items, and profitsharing, was up only 0.4% year-over-year versus our guidance of 1% to 2%. This was largely due to costs shifting into the second half of this year and in total, about $30 million shifted from first half into second half, primarily in the areas of advertising and technology. We also have had some second half cost inflation that is driven by the timing of events and spend. And for third quarter, our unit cost inflation includes a heavy concentration of advertising. Part of it was planned, as we discussed, related to Flight 1380 and in addition, year-over-year trends will be impacted by lower advertising last year third quarter, resulting from the pullback in advertising following the hurricanes and natural disasters. Maintenance expense is also expected to be higher year-over-year due to timing of heavy maintenance events. And we continue to see a higher mix of operating expense versus capitalization with our technology spend. With all that in mind, we currently expect our third quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, special items, and profitsharing, to increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we also have some inflationary year-over-year pressures relative to first half 2018 trends, particularly in depreciation as we lap the Classic retirements and continue investing in the fleet. Also, as you think ahead to fourth quarter, keep in mind, we'll have some incremental unit cost pressure from our recent reduction in fourth quarter year-over-year ASM growth, as it is difficult to shed a similar level of fixed costs overnight. As such, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel, special items, and profitsharing, is now expected to be flat to up 1% year-over-year. This is more inflation than I would like and we will certainly strive to drive efficiency and productivity. And as a quick reminder again, this guidance does include our tentative agreement with AMFA. Before I move along to the balance sheet and cash flow, I also want to thank our people for their continued efforts and diligence to efficiently and effectively control our costs, especially in a rising fuel price environment. As we have communicated to you all many times, maintaining an investment-grade and very strong balance sheet is among our top priorities, and we continue to have a balanced approach to managing our capital. Our liquidity remains very strong. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, with free cash flow at $1.1 billion. There was no change to our full year CapEx guidance, which remains in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range this year, with $1.2 billion of that for aircraft. During the first half of the year, we executed $1 billion in share repurchases. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched at the end of April, which will be completed no later than the end of this month. And this leaves $350 million remaining under our $2 billion authorization. And as you will probably recall, in May our board of directors approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and our board substantially increased our quarterly dividend 28% to $0.16 per share, or $0.64 annually. This builds up on the significant value we've returned to shareholders, which over the past five years we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends. And we intend to maintain our balanced approach to capital deployment with the continued focus on profitably growing our business and strong returns above our cost of capital. I will close out with a quick recap of our fleet and capacity. We took delivery of 12 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and two MAX 8s in the quarter, bringing our total fleet count to 730. And we expect to end the year at 751 aircraft. And we continue to plan for our 2018 capacity to increase in the low 4% range, with third quarter up in the 4.5% to 5% range and fourth quarter up in the 6.5% to 7% range year-over-year. And as Tom mentioned, we are on track with our ETOPS work to hopefully begin selling Hawaii service this year. Lastly, we currently have 30 firm aircraft deliveries in 2019 and our current plan is to earmark some of our 737-700 aircraft for retirement next year, as we continue to invest in fleet modernization. We continue to have tremendous flexibility in our order book and fleet, which will serve us well in any environment. In summary, we had a solid second quarter, record second quarter earnings per share, and we generated what we expect to be industry-leading margins and high returns on invested capital, despite higher fuel costs and our second quarter challenges. Our employees performed magnificently and I am proud of what we accomplished together. The recent strength in yields is encouraging and we are focused on reliable, efficient operations as we work diligently to control our costs. And I'm pleased with the returns we are seeing from these significant investments we've made on fleet modernization, our new reservation system, and our Rapid Rewards Program, as well as overall strength of our network. We have ample liquidity and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders, while continuing to invest in our people and our business. To reiterate, we are focused on revenue generation and prudent cost control to deliver healthy margins and shareholder returns. With that, Laurie, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Music] (00:24:55-00:25:16) And we will take our first question today from Jack Atkins at Stephens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon, guys. How are you all doing? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We're doing fantastic. Thank you. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Well, thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess, first off for either Gary or Tom or maybe both if you'd like to expand on it, just the tone of your prepared comments was very constructive with regard to the momentum that you're seeing in your business. I would just be curious to know, is this macro related? Is this due to the flexibility in the tools that you're seeing sort of playing out from the new reservation system? I would just like for you to expand on that for a moment, because it certainly sounds like the business, as you look out into the fourth quarter, could be heading toward inflection and profitability. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I'll start and Tom will clean it up. But I do think that we are in an environment, here in 2018, where the economy is very strong. It's growing and travel demand reflects that. We have improved our revenue-producing capability significantly over the past \u2013 oh, call it \u2013 seven years and are in the midst now, of course, of taking, I hope, a leg up again. We had some, obviously, well-covered disruptions here in the second quarter. But I think, Jack, most of the things that we're reporting to you are micro, not macro. And no doubt, our competitors benefited from some of our issues in the second quarter and I expect that we will claw that back, and that's happening here. But aside from the \u2013 I don't know how you think about it, whether it's micro or macro, when you get down to the industry level, it's still a very competitive industry and the industry collectively is growing, and that means we're facing more competitive capacity as time goes by. But I think most of what Tom is reporting today is mostly unique to Southwest and our execution, working through some challenges. And again, I know we've said it repeatedly, but I think everyone here has done a marvelous job of responding to an unexpected challenge and getting through that. And now I think we've got a lot to look forward to, in addition to planned activities that we're rolling out in 2018. So the nice thing is, we're seeing the results we hoped for and we have more to come. And I'll just put in a little teaser that we have the benefits flowing from our new reservation system, which are well-known and well-covered, and now we need to deliver. And again, Tom's report was we're pretty much on track with that and now we're beginning to work on a portfolio of new ideas that will flow in the future. It's not going to be fourth quarter. It may not even be in 2019, but we need to keep this pipeline full and I'm very confident that our folks will continue to do that. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: I guess, the only thing I'd add, Jack, is just to kind of jump out of that, I think the execution, both the operational execution that Mike talked about and the frontline execution is outstanding. I think that one thing I didn't hit on in my comments that I think is important \u2013 and I think this is kind of a macro thing \u2013 our marketing kicked back in in a very, very big way. It was really highly effective in driving demand back to our website and even bookings. I think that as we drive more demand to the site and the new capabilities that Andrew and the commercial side of the house have around yield management, pricing management techniques and tools, we're starting to really monetize those things. And I think it's really valuable and it's really important, and it gives us a level of granularity we've just never had before. We're seeing it come to fruition, so I think that contributes a lot to it. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's a very helpful answer. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up to that, Tom, kind of going back to your comments on the reservation system benefits that you realized in the second quarter that you anticipate realizing in the third quarter. Am I right with that math to assume that leaves about $90 million or so that's left to be realized in the fourth quarter? And if I'm not right, could you kind of give us a correct number on that? And then, is all that expected to flow through on the revenue side, or will that come in other places on the P&L? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, you're probably very close. I'm not sure exactly if it's $90 but you're not out of the ballpark. I'm sorry. What was the other part of your question, Jack? Is all going to flow through... Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Well, $90 million or so roughly, is that going to be on the revenue side, or is that going to flow through other places on the P&L? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, it'll be predominantly on the revenue side. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : We'll go next to Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, everybody. Thank you so much. I was hoping you might talk at the very least qualitatively about how you're thinking about your capacity growth, given that I think you've loaded your schedule for the first, whatever it is, nine weeks of 2019. It's showing sub 3% growth. I'm pretty sure you haven't loaded Hawaii in there, so that's probably going to be incremental. But when we think about the year as a whole and some of the wonky stuff that we're going to be lapping in the back half of 2019, how are you guys thinking about maybe like a core growth rate for the year on a system ASM basis? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I'll start here. We're at a pace to grow in the low 4% range this year. That's down from what I had planned for us for the year. I don't think that we'll grow over 5% next year. That, again, is what we had planned initially for 2018, so it would be something less than that. But we haven't fully baked the year and, yeah, you should \u2013 but, Hunter, the point you're making is a good one, which is you should not assume based on what you've seen there for the first part of 2019 that that is our growth rate for the year. I certainly agree with that. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Okay. And then when you guys have said in the past that you won't fly a route that isn't profitable, how are you defining that term? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Revenues minus expenses. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So is it operating expenses or is it the marginal cost of operating that extra flight, or is it all-in expenses including aircraft ownership? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Fully allocated. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Always fully allocated? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Of course. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So now markets take time to mature and we have a set of very mature markets that are well into the profitability range. And we have start-up markets that sometimes will take several years before they reach the kind of maturity that we're satisfied with. But I'll tell you this. Once we decide to put Southwest in a market, we are loathe to pull out. So we have the overall cost structure and operating margins and balance sheet to be patient, and there are a thousand city pair examples over the years that would support that patience. A lot of our competitors, of course, will go in, they pull out, and we're just not going to do that. But wherever we decide to go, it is with, obviously, an eye towards success, which means absolutely fully allocated profitability, of course. We can't achieve the kind of results that we have unless we have a philosophy like that, so I'm not sure I understand the question. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you, Gary. Operator : And hi, sir. Please check your mute button. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Who? Operator : Jamie Baker. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Ah, well, there you go. Operator : Yay. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Gary, at the industry level, the competition is finally beginning to emphasize the goal of achieving higher margins next year. And that's a welcome change since the industry margins have been down for, I guess, three years now. But by the looks of consensus and certainly my own model, it seems that \u2013 I mean, it's basically a layup that Southwest has higher margins next year. I'm not asking you to endorse this. Rather, can you identify anything, any sort of headwind, that would be specific to Southwest that might interfere with the process of expanding margins? I guess I'm asking you to kind of play your own devil's advocate here. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, while I appreciate the complement there and we're very confident and I think our folks have the track record to demonstrate, I did have to chuckle at your report this morning. You know you left the H out of Southwest there. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : We've already taken heat for that. Oh, man. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I just mainly want you to know that I read your stuff. But the other thing that I... Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, it was a test. You passed. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, the other thing that I noted is that you referred to one of our competitor's historic statement of this is not a hobby. Back to the previous question, it has never been a hobby at Southwest and we have a very long track record of producing. So as we think about the risk associated with next year in light of your question, I wish I could agree with you that thinking about a year is a layup, because it's just a tough business. Things happen. And they just have to be managed and we need to plan and manage the company in such a way that we could absorb the unexpected. And that's why it's important, far from this being a hobby, you have to have a strong balance sheet, you have to have strong profit margin, so you can absorb the kind of unexpected blows that no doubt will come up. It could be higher fuel prices next year. It could be a recession. It could be undesired, back to Tammy's comment, complaint about our \u2013 even the modest cost pressures that we're seeing here in the second half, it could be unexpected cost pressures. So all of that has to be managed and there's just tremendous operating leverage in an airline, because of all the high fixed costs. So all that just needs to be balanced accordingly. Now, understanding we're in the business to take a risk as we assess the outlook for 2019, I agree with you. I think that the economy looks pretty good. I'm not overly concerned about fuel price increases from here. Tammy's pointed out, I think, very well how well our hedge is positioned. We have very modest levels of debt. We don't have any significant debt financing requirements. And we have new equipment coming in next year, which is 100% MAX. This year, obviously, we're getting a blend of some NGs, as well as MAX. So it's a pretty good setup for next year. We'll need to manage our expansion and it will be Hawaii. And then secondly, we need to manage the execution of various initiatives we have under way and our spending there, and then just our overall cost. So, as I've put in the press release in my comment, I want more of a focus of our company on the operating cost as a priority than what it has been over the last 5 to 10 years, simply because we had higher priorities. We needed to transform Southwest, which our folks have done. So I would just \u2013 hopefully that's responsive to your question. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We never ever approach a year as if it is a layup. That's, quite frankly, when you get into trouble. But even in a year like this one, we're having a few unexpected challenges, our folks are doing extraordinarily well. So I think we'll be very well-positioned and I think, once again, I believe we'll have a really good 2019. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Excellent. And as a follow-up to that, Gary, you did mention in passing, I think it was new ideas that will flow in the future as it relates back to some of your newfound capabilities. Can you opine on that at all? Are you talking about possible product initiatives that you're considering, something that might alter the in-flight experience? Is it something that might impact boarding? Is it something about distribution? I'm sure it's accretive in your model. I'm just wondering what part of the either booking process or flight process it might impact. Not looking for specifics, just where might this manifest. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I don't think we need to change the essence of what Southwest Airlines is to still find opportunities to drive revenues. And I think the way you \u2013 it's not ready for primetime, although we are looking at the prioritization of our initiatives over the next three years to see how we might want to fit some new ideas in. The main reason I wanted to bring it up today is, we've had a good flow of initiatives over the last 5 to 10 years, and they have served us well. And we have not mentioned what's next and what is beyond our new reservation system, and we're in the midst of executing that. And I think that there's \u2013 fortunately, I think that there are a lot more opportunities and when they're ready for primetime, we'll share them. So it is mainly just to let our investors know that we're not sitting idly by and counting on the initiatives that you know of, that now it is time for us to get busy on the next stream, and I would expect that in the not too distant future that Tammy and Ryan would be in a position to begin unveiling those. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's excellent, Gary. I can assure you we'll fine-tune our spellchecker as well. Take care. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: All right, sir. Operator : And we'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hi. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Tom, you made some fairly constructive comments about 3Q and what it's implying about 4Q based on forward bookings, et cetera, and it seems like you've got a nice acceleration coming as you move ahead. But what am I missing in that thinking? Are there any headwinds that we should be aware of as we start looking at the next quarter? Because, obviously, it seems to be a bit of an anomaly this quarter with all the various things you pointed out. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. I think there are anomalies in the third quarter that we already talked about. But, again, just kind of back to the base trends we're seeing, strengthening since late May, early June, into July in terms of shopping, pricing, close-in strong, further-out strong. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are. We're only published through February of the fourth quarter, obviously. So where we are in the curve is very, very early, but we do feel pretty bullish about where we are in the third quarter. I think that we are saying flat to plus or minus 1%, and I think we have a real shot on the revenue side, right? But we have a lot of work to do. And where that goes in the fourth quarter, there's nothing that myself or the team is looking at that says, boy, there's something very foreboding in front of us. We aren't seeing that. I think as trends, if they're going to carry on as they are, I think you'll have a very nice third, fourth quarter, so we have a lot of work to do. Just as Gary said, there's no such thing as a layup here at all. So we have a lot of work to do, but that's probably how I would answer that, Rajeev. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And, Gary, in terms of just how you're approaching capacity here, in particular the implication of higher fuel, I mean, how is that impacting the way you're thinking about capacity? I know you've trimmed a little bit to stabilize sort of the RASM environment, but I guess the specific question is, how is higher oil impacting your thinking of the business, in particular capacity as you look forward? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, obviously, it can't be ignored. And I think the one thing that I've not talked about that I do want to just make the point in terms of how we're thinking about capacity is, we have invested a great deal in Southwest Airlines, and especially in recent years. And by definition, the investment means for the future, for future growth. We've just opened up a new training facility across the street from our headquarters. We've just acquired new flight training simulators. We're investing in airports across the country, and all of that creates overhead. And to not add capacity and absorb that would sub-optimize the investment that has been made in the company, which has been very, very necessary. So I would just ask you to also factor that in. A lot of operating leverage, a very heavy amount of fixed costs in our business, and you just leave a lot on the table if you don't fully take advantage of those investments. Now, the concern that you have about higher fuel prices, that's why we hedge. That's why we think it is important to hedge. And I think that it's served us extremely well over the past generation in something that \u2013 as I think about the next generation in Southwest, I hope they always employ that kind of a risk management technique. But at the margin, higher fuel prices have to make us a little more circumspect about our expansion, and it probably causes us to take less risk with the additional flights that we add. I think finally, if we do decide that we need to reduce capacity, we have more flexibility built into Southwest today than ever. Again, from a growth plan, it's not literally reducing the fleet, but we have more flexibility today than ever. And it just comes with a penalty, a unit cost penalty, because there'll be a lot of unabsorbed overhead, if you will. So all of that just needs to be balanced and right now my view for 2019 is that it is a year that looks very solid in terms of us thinking about expanding not more than 5%, as I mentioned to Hunter, but certainly it's a year that we feel like the risk/reward is such that it argues in favor of continuing our expansion. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Gary. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Savi Syth at Raymond James. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on the fuel side. Tammy, you mentioned that hedging really kicks in about $80. Is that for 2019, too? And also connected to that, what's the portion of the $345 million that's related to 2019? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, hey, Savi. Yeah, it's similar. It's a similar story for 2019. We are 64% hedged for next year, so we're in good shape as well. So kind of a similar story. And as we get to $80 per barrel, we would see those hedges kick in more significantly. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Are you able to give the breakout of the fair market value that's kind of related to 2019 itself? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. Yeah, let me pull that number for you here. If you'll give me one second, I'll give you the breakdown. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure. And maybe, Tammy, while you're looking that, if I can ask a follow-up on kind of the unit revenue trend here. I was just wondering what the hurricane \u2013 is the hurricane a benefit to 3Q RASM look? What I'm really trying to get at is, as these overhangs come out, it sounds like you're comfortable with kind of getting back to that positive RASM trajectory, but I just wanted to clarify if I'm hearing that correctly. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, Savi, this is Tom. I think the way we look at that is probably about 0.5 point of upside for us. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But that's all factored into Tom's... Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's already in. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...flat plus or minus range, so we've got \u2013 as usual, there's just a lot of stuff in the stew. So there's pluses, there's minuses, and that is one. That is assuming, of course, we don't have a similar impact again this year, but that's what's implicit in there. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: That is one of the tailwinds that gets us to our current guidance. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And, Tom, do you \u2013 go ahead, Tammy. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Oh, go ahead. Finish your thought there, Savi. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I was just kind of curious, so, Tom, are you feeling comfortable that we can get to the positive RASM trajectories? Is that kind of the implication of some of the comments, or am I taking it too far? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I wouldn't \u2013 I'm not sure I'm ready to say that we're ready to commit to that. I do feel like the trends and what we're seeing are really, really solid. We feel good about that. And I think if we were to see things continue as \u2013 hey, listen. I think things are looking solid for us and they feel very good. I'm not ready to commit to positive RASM. But, boy, I'll tell you what, if you're wondering is that what we're shooting for, that's absolutely what we're shooting for is the execution towards positive RASM, and we're going after it hard. We're going after it in terms of pricing, in terms of the capacity, in terms of the schedule, in terms of several things, in terms of the marketing. So we're going after it. Things are blazing, but that's what we're shooting for. That's what we're working towards. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And, Savi, the only way I would try to answer your question, it's not different than what Tom is saying at all, but we know where we are today and we know where we've come from, and we're really happy about that. We have good line of sight to most of the third quarter and we're very happy with that. You know, like we do, that trying to forecast 60 days, much less 90 or 120 days out, it's just not accurate. Clearly, one can logically put together a set of expectations that say second quarter turned out pretty good, all things considered. Third quarter, as of July 26, has shown notable improvement, which I would have expected, but you still have to go do it. And then the third quarter is hampered by a few things and those kind of burdens clear in the fourth quarter. So one would expect, I think, that fourth quarter is better yet again than the third quarter. And, obviously, if we're talking flat to up or slightly up or down, logically then you would say, yeah, that means that fourth quarter is positive. So I think all those things ring true. It's just we're not ready to forecast that. We don't have enough information to do that, but we're very encouraged with the trends and I agree with the way Tom described it, which is we have palpable momentum and with a little bit of luck here, the momentum will continue to build. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: And I'll just chime in. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Appreciate it. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Savi, I'll just chime in, too, before I answer your fuel question. Just in terms of the trends from quarter-to-quarter, Tom walked you through all the noise with all the headwinds and tailwinds for third quarter, but I do think it's \u2013 we're excited again just to get to the fourth quarter where we have clean comparisons, and so that's a plus. We're seeing great benefits from our new reservation system and what we're seeing in the business trends, again, just repeating what we said earlier, demand is very solid. And what's particularly encouraging is the strength that we're seeing in yields and particularly the close-in yields. So all that to say, we're excited to get these headwinds behind us and looking forward to the fourth quarter. On your question on the breakdown, I believe it was on the fair market value of our hedge, so the roughly $185 million of that was 2019 and $112 million of that is 2020, and then the rest is split between 2021 and 2022. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Helpful. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Helane Becker at Cowen and Company. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. When you guys were thinking about Hawaii and ETOPS certification, I know the FAA \u2013 I think this is a question for Mike \u2013 I know the FAA takes its time to do and it could take up to a year. But can you just say if where you are in the process of gaining approval is where you thought you would be six or nine months ago? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, Helane, we had set out a timeframe or a timeline, and what I would tell you is we're along that timeline. So what's important for us right now, so the FAA does have our manual procedures that we have defined. And what we're trying to do at this point in time is enough exercises to make sure that we have thought through all the different things that possibly could go wrong on a flight. It could be a mechanical issue; it could be customer illness on the flight; it could be headwinds; it could be a problem at the airport that you're landing in. And just making sure that the procedure that we have defined would anticipate and address those things, and that we're practiced at doing that . So that's the process that we're in right now. And as we go through that, we'll have some comfort that, yeah, these procedures are well. So I would expect in the next 30 to 60 days, we will understand that these procedures are ready to go, and then we'll begin training and, hopefully, move onto a validation flight after that. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And then when we think about that training and so on, I'm sure, because that's your timeline, the costs are built into your guidance. But is that going to necessitate hiring additional head count to kind of fly the existing route network while you're going through that training process? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, and we've already accomplished all of that, so we've already understood that we're going to have a cadre for example of pilots that will go through some ETOPS training, that will pull them off of their normal flying responsibilities. And we've already adjusted our head count needs for that. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And, Helane, I did want to \u2013 you didn't specifically ask about it, but just on the business of Hawaii, we have a long track record with our network planning group of predicting the success or failure, quite frankly, of new routes, additional frequencies, and so forth. So their forecast accuracy is quite amazing and, of course, you'd have to factor in the unknown, how will competitors react and so on. But just to repeat that the gateways, say, the four gateways from California to the four island destinations that we've selected, all forecast very well. And then in addition to that, while the inter-island was not our initial vision, if you will, for our Hawaii service, once we were asked to look at that and once we took a good look at it with the way we would flow our aircraft, it also forecasted really well, so we're very enthused about that, how fast it will ramp-up, I think, remains to be seen, of course. As we were talking earlier, nothing is ever a layup, but the work that Mike has been conducting has gone exceptionally well. And, I would say, just from my thumbnail sketch of it, we're right where we thought we would be, but there is still work remaining between now and the fall, and ultimately it's up to the FAA to decide whether they're going to give us the good housekeeping seal of approval here. But so far, that's gone really well. And then on the business side of things, we are no less enthused. If anything, what I was trying to suggest is that as we've looked at more opportunities, we've gotten even more enthused about that. So it'll be our commercial focus here pretty soon and we're going to stick with it and we will succeed. Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thanks, Gary, and team, Tom, everybody. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question and we'll take our last question from Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Hey. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on a question that Jamie asked earlier, but maybe a little bit more specifically. Can you weigh in on potential move to assigned seating? For example, Ryanair sees half their customers pay to reserve a seat. That's value they see in sort of paying for. Nearly as many also pay up for priority boarding. In core Southwest markets, your customers know, appreciate, or at least understand your open seating. But in markets like New York, where you have less presence, it has to be costing you some share among corporates and leisure passengers. So can you give us some confirmation it's something you're actually looking at? How quickly could you be in a position to make the change? And was the res system a prerequisite to making that change? Thanks for taking the questions. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Great questions. Well, let me be very blunt. We are not looking at assigning seats right now. We're not talking about assigning seats now, and we're not talking about looking at it at some time in the future. Just trying to be very clear on your questions. On the points that you make \u2013 well, before I address that, the opportunities that we have to layer in some additional initiatives don't require assigned seating and they are very handsome opportunities. These are ideas. They're until \u2013 as my good friend Bob Jordan always says, it's an idea until it's a plan. And so we're in the midst of developing some plans. But it does not require assigned seating to pursue some really exciting opportunities I feel like we have. Now, everything you said is true. There are absolutely customers who demand assigned seating. We do have examples around the world where carriers have gone to assigned seating. Assigned seating does open up an array of opportunities that we could think about. Tom, I think it probably is fair to say that the new reservation system at least puts us in a position where we can more realistically think about that. So I like being in a position where some day, if we decide to do it, we could evaluate assigned seating. And it ain't happening now and it won't happen next year. And why I would want to predict anything beyond 18 months, I don't know, so I won't. But I think, Duane, all I wanted to allow is that \u2013 with our investors, is that look it's something that we could consider. There are pluses and minuses on balance to this point. In our Southwest life, we have concluded that we are better off with what we're doing today, and I still believe that by the way, but it doesn't mean that we can't come back and revisit that at some point in the future. But we don't need it right now. And what I'm really excited about here in the near term are things that we don't get asked about as much or talk about as much, and it's all the things on the operations side that Mike Van de Ven has underway with a new maintenance record keeping system, a new flight following system, and just better communication capabilities for our operations employees, which should put us in a position to offer better customer service and be more efficient. Our folks are running a really great airline right now and it will only get better. And now, to be able to think about layering in some more new revenue initiatives is very exciting. And one of these days, we can cuss and discuss about assigned seating, but it's nothing that's happening right now. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: And, Gary, if I could just add to that. Duane, this is Tom. And what may surprise you is we actually did look at this \u2013 when was it, Gary, 2004, 2005? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Right. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: And not just looked at it. We actually flew real flights with real customers, real passengers, out of San Diego in I think it was 2005. So, I guess, the reason I bring that up is we are not so wed to things that we're not open to looking at new ideas, new ways of doing it. That actually proved to us that we could do it if we chose to. Our customers actually asked us not to. That was the interesting thing. It was actually the business travelers, interestingly enough. But that work did give results in the new boarding process. I guess, my point is you get a derivative benefit of looking at new things. I agree with Gary completely. It is not on our punch list right now at all. We have much bigger things to get at. But I don't want you to think we are immutable in what our product is and we'll continue to make the product stronger. That's just not one of the things we're going to be working on. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Part of our current thinking is all the facts that you all know, which is if we're not the strongest brand in airlines, we are among the strongest brands, and that's with the product that we offer today, to Tom's point, about what our customers told us more than 10 years ago. And number two, doing it the way we do it, we've been the largest airline in the country for 15 years. So I don't like the saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but there's certainly no evidence that it's broken. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Okay. Okay. We'll stay in suspense and thank you for the detailed response. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's analyst portion of the call. Thank you for joining us. And we will now begin with the media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Laurie, and welcome to members of the media to our call today. Before we start taking some questions, Laurie, could you give them some instructions on how to queue up to begin our Q&A session? Operator : Certainly. [Music] (01:06:12-01:06:55) And we'll go first to Andrew Tangel at The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : Hi, Southwest folks. Thanks for taking the question. A question about fuel costs and fares. How much more room do you all have to raise fares as you try to recoup these higher fuel costs? At what point do you see higher fares, higher than where they are now, scaring off customers and reducing demand? And right now we're in a time where consumers are paying a lot more for a lot of other products. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, thanks for the question. I would just want to get my factoids straight here, but the \u2013 first of all, we had a very solid second quarter. I think you're familiar with the challenges that we had, so despite the challenges. And during the quarter our fares were down year-over-year 4.4%. So despite the fact that fuel prices were up, we used savings from the tax reform to kind of fund that, if you will, and we didn't sock it to our customers. So we're America's low fare leader. We work hard to keep our fares low. And to the extent that fares go up at Southwest, we try to do that in, obviously, a modest and gradual way. Obviously, if our overall costs go up, it puts pressure on us and we need to be compensated for our service and some things have to be passed along to the customer. But we're in good shape and we had a solid quarter. So we've got some \u2013 I think we'll have very good comparisons with our average fare levels this year versus last year. So I'm certainly not warning you or anybody that they need to be looking out for fare increases coming from Southwest. Doesn't mean we won't increase fares. I'm just saying that we're in good shape and right now you're not seeing overall fare increases. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Mind if I add to that... (01:09:32) Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Andrew, this is Tom. Just a thought on that as well. I mean, we're pretty proud of the fact that we are a low fare leader. That's part of who we are, it's part of the brand. I think that as we get more sophisticated \u2013 I think you heard the rest of the call, as we get more sophisticated with some of our capabilities, we're going to have the ability to manage our pricing and our fares much more specifically. And what I would hope for us to be able to do is to retain low fares without \u2013 just retain those low fares, but also drive our other fares up. What I mean by that is, if we could isolate low fares into certain parts of the day where you typically have lower demand, we could still make that low fare available for our customer, and then drive other demand into the meat of the day, where you'd like to try and get a little more yield. But I think it's very important, from my perspective, that we have the ability to maintain the low fare leadership, and that's going to require pricing tools, which is what's part of what we put in with our new res systems. So, low fares are important for Southwest Airlines and for our customers. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : Okay. Yeah, just if you could at least address the thrust of the question, too, about how much more customers can bear at this point. Do you have room to raise fares if you needed to, to what extent, or at what point do you hit the limit of how much customers are willing to pay and you lose passenger traffic? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, and again, I think all I was trying to illustrate is that our fares are down and they're down every year since 2014, as I recall. So we're doing a good job of holding the line for our customers, and so I think by extension, because we have not been raising fares overall, I think one can understand that, no, we haven't, \"reached the limit.\" But I think the other thing I would in fairness to you and your question, is we don't talk about where we're going with our fares, and so I wasn't intending to hint to you what we might be doing tomorrow or six months from now. That's not appropriate and for competitive reasons also, we wouldn't want to do that. But that's what our behavior has been and that's where we were in the second quarter, and so hopefully that answers... Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on \u2013 it's sort of related, but also just something you were talking about earlier with additional revenue streams to diversify revenue streams. Your competitors have talked about how they're diversifying their revenue streams. You've all talked about it too. Specifically, are you looking at potentially adding bag fees, change fees, cancelation fees as you're trying to keep fares low and deal with these fuel costs? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I didn't offer anything specific. It was worse than generic. It was very obtuse and I know that. It's basically just to let folks know that we're working on it and enthused about some ideas that we have. However, to your question, the specific question you posed, we are not thinking about bag fees. We are not thinking about change fees. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : All right. Thanks. Appreciate it. I'll stop asking follow-up questions. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: They're all good. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Mary Schlangenstein at Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Hi. I have a question for Mike, please. Mike, what led to the decision for Southwest to step-up the inspections on your engine fan blades and do those more frequently? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, hey, Mary. How are you? Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Good. Thanks. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, as there have been industry inspections ongoing, and I believe those industry inspections are in their final stages, but I'm aware of maybe four or five additional industry findings. And based on those results, GE is contemplating a change in their lube and inspection intervals from something other than 3,000 cycles, and they've talked to us more about something in the 1,600 to 1,800 range. So, based on that, Mary, we just decided to make a proactive change to the intervals. And today our fleet is on a 1,600-cycle reinspection program. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. So can you be any more specific in terms of what the findings were? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Other than that they were just \u2013 there are cracks in fan blades out there with respect to the industry, and I think that more frequent lubrications helped mitigate potentially that and moving that cycle down would slow the propagation rates down and just mitigate some of the risk. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Right. And were any of those additional cracks found on Southwest fan blades? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: What I'm talking about \u2013 I don't know on the GE. The four to five, I don't know. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : You don't know whose they were found on or you don't know if they were on Southwest? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Those four to five I was talking about were not found on Southwest. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Were not. Okay. Great. Excellent. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And we do have time for one additional question. We'll take the last question from Dave Koenig at The Associated Press. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Hi. Good afternoon, guys and Tammy. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hey, David. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Hello. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay. You answered questions about assigned seats, bag fees, and change fees. It strikes me you're not always the lowest price carrier on a lot of routes, and I wonder if you did have a premium cabin or you had premium seats, maybe you could subsidize lower fares in the back of the plane, or any ideas like that on your list for things that might be upcoming in the next few years? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No, that's not in the basket of things that I was alluding to. Now, having said that, we can always think about the opportunity that you just described. I would kind of lump that in with assigned seating, and that's something that we could always do. But, Dave, we can't guarantee today, 20 years ago, 40 years ago, that every time you look for a fare, that we will be the lowest fare. We can't guarantee that. That's never been the case. The vast \u2013 I don't know if it's the vast majority. The majority of the time, Southwest will be the low fare and it's an easy claim to make if you include the bag fees and change fees, and that's something that we keep track of. Obviously, we're very familiar with the revenue. What airlines try to do is to generate a certain amount of revenue per departure. And through an array of features that are offered, some customers will willingly pay more and some will willingly pay less, and that is the theory in a nutshell. So your question certainly has merit, but we're not specifically targeting that technique as a revenue initiative at this time. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay. Well, you mentioned, Gary, the bag fee, but you can get around that advantage by getting a branded credit card on one of the other guys, which is why I think that the lack of a change fee is so much more important as an advantage for you folks. But wouldn't there be an opportunity there to subsidize cheaper seats in the back? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, yeah, that's how it works. That's my point is that, yes, I think airlines understand that customers \u2013 they don't speak with one voice, so they come to us with an array of objectives. Some people want more, some people want less for a cheaper price. And so we try to strike that balance and offer them what we can professionally, expertly deliver, if you will. But, yeah, we do what you're describing today. We offer Business Select today. We offer EarlyBird today. So we do offer an array of attributes, and we try to make it a pure choice for the customer as opposed to forcing a customer to pay for a bag fee. With respect to what our competitors do, we try to avoid the complexity, make it really easy. You don't have to jump through any hoops to have free bags on Southwest Airlines. And that works very well for us and we get tremendous brand loyalty as a consequence of that. So I think the answer to your question is, yes. And, David, we choose not to do those things. And obviously, what we've chosen to do works very well for us and makes us the most profitable airline, so I'm just glad everybody else doesn't do what we do. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Thank you very much. Operator : And at this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Laurie. As always, if you all have any other questions, please do follow-up with our communications team. They're standing by at 214-792-4847, or you can always reach out to us through our media website at swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Operator : And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Again I'd like to thank you all for joining us.",

Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters Alison Sider - The Wall Street Journal Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. My name is Abby, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Abby, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we get started, please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current expectations. And we also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. And for more information regarding forward-looking statements and our reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results, please visit our Investor Relations section of southwest.com, where you can find this morning's earnings release as well as our SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Gary. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for an excellent third quarter performance. It was a very nice recovery from the second quarter, which was down 3% on a RASM basis due to Flight 1380. And then that was a nice turnaround to the third quarter RASM performance of up 1.2%. Mexico was weak for us in terms of revenue. But our domestic performance, excluding all the international, the domestic performance was a solid RASM of plus 2.3% year over year. And it is 2.9% if you adjust for stage and gauge increases. Overall, we had a sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement of 2 percentage points ahead of normal trends, so, again, it was a very nice recovery. Our year-over-year comps always have noise in them but I'm expecting another sequential trend improvement in fourth quarter and then a year-over-year improvement as we said in the press release of 1% to 2%. So, again, that would be another nice better than trend, sequential improvement if we do that. Our unit cost ex-items will come in roughly flat to up 1% for the year-end for the fourth quarter for that matter but another excellent cost performance. We wanted to provide you an early look ahead to 2019. Our confidence level forecasting revenues is never a 100%, of course, and especially looking a year out but our goal for next year right now is positive RASM and of at least 3%. And while it is a goal, trends and initiatives that we already have underway would support that goal. Our confidence level in predicting cost is much higher of course than revenues. And based on the planning that's currently underway, the preliminary read is that unit cost ex-items will also be up at least 3%. I'm not satisfied with that as I'm sure our investors aren't either and Tammy will describe the cost pressures further. But I did want to provide some perspective first. Just looking across the last decade plus, we've committed to strategic initiatives and invested accordingly. Some investments were revenue generating, some investments were capacity and growth related, some investments were efficiency related. But as a consequence of that strategy and those investments, the airline has been transformed and the cost during this intervening time period have been well controlled. And to do that, we've relied primarily on fleet modernization to accomplish that. We have a stronger, much more prosperous, but a more complex airline. In some cases, there are costs associated with driving these higher revenues. But the main point that I want to make is that our focus with our strategic efforts has clearly been on transforming the airline and driving more revenue along with operational reliability and customer service. I'm very pleased with the results of all those efforts. The results must be sustained and continuously improved from here. But eventually, I think all of us at Southwest knew that the time would come where our initiatives would need to zero in on efficiency and productivity and just overall cost control. And clearly that time has arrived and cost will be our number one priority. So the basic inflationary themes that Tammy is going to talk about we constantly battle. We're investing in airport infrastructure. We're investing in technology initiatives and projects. Aircraft maintenance is an ever-increasing burden. And then there is just natural salaries, wages and benefits inflation. So the opportunities to offset that natural inflation are what you would expect lies in modernizing our fleet, just overall quality of our flight schedule, continuing to drive operational efficiency, controlling our G&A spending. And then, from there of course we just rely on individual department missions. So for 2019, at this preliminary juncture while we're seeing the known cost pressures, we aren't yet seeing the productivity offsets. There are offsets in fuel because of fuel efficiency which of course aren't showing up in the cost ex-fuel items. But we're not seeing enough productivity offsets yet. So speaking plainly, it will take more focus on our part and more effort on our part to make that happen. And as I've already said that's where our focus will be and we may have to de-prioritize some other yearned for things that we have in the meantime. I'll also point out that many of our efficiencies are already underway. Again, we'll show up in jet fuel consumption. And we'll need to clearly identify that for you as offsets in the future. So we have a challenge. And we always do by the way. We always have challenges. We're very well prepared and very well positioned. Number one, we have a very strong balance sheet with declining leverage and it's below 30%. We have very strong liquidity with cash levels well ahead of our target. We just reported record earnings for the quarter. And barring the unforeseen, we expect very strong year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter. We have an outstanding fuel hedge that's built for the next 24 months. We have very manageable growth plans for 2019. And in fact, we need growth to absorb investments that were made related to capacity like airports and training facilities. Our operations are excellent. Our brand and our customer ratings are very high and industry-leading. Our culture of course is unmatched, and our ability to attract talented people in this falling employment (sic) [unemployment] environment is very strong. And then finally and I think most importantly, we have a low-cost DNA. We have a proven track record of managing not just cost, but industry-leading profits and margins and returns. And in the meantime, again assuming nothing unforeseen, we will continue our focus on excellent shareholder returns. So with that hopefully helpful perspective, let me just turn the call over to Tom Nealon to take us through the commercial side here. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thank you, Gary. Good morning everybody. As Gary said, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and we are seeing continued strength into the fourth quarter in terms of passenger demand throughout the booking curve as well as continued strength in the pricing environments and very solid yield momentum, so we're very pleased with that. Before getting into the fourth quarter, let me walk you through the performance indicators of the third quarter. I'll try and tie that back to my comments in the July call. So as you know, we ended the third quarter with a record $5.6 billion in operating revenues, which is up about 5% year over year. And our passenger yields increased 2.3% for the quarter. So again, we were very pleased with that. Our load factor was 83.9%, which was down about 1 point year over year. But we actually saw passenger growth of 2.5% for the quarter, and we carried a record 33.9 million passengers in the third quarter. So we're very pleased with the strength of passenger demand as well as the strength in the pricing environment, and I think our teams did a phenomenal job of balancing our yields and load factors for a very well-balanced strong result. So that's all good. I shared with you all in July going into the quarter we knew that we had three RASM headwinds, which all together were a 2 point drag on Q3 RASM. First, we had the Rapid Rewards accounting change, which was 1 point. Second, we had about 0.5 point of drag from our summer fare sale, which was part of our 1380 recovery as you'll recall. And third, we expect about 0.5 point of drag resulting from the suboptimal schedule, which is tied to the shoulder flying and the fleet retirement and such. These headwinds materialized as we expected in the third quarter, which again was 2 points of RASM headwinds. And also, as expected, we do not see them repeating in the fourth quarter. In our mid-September update, we made a positive revision to our Q3 RASM outlook, an outlook of roughly flat to RASM increasing in the 1% to 1.5% range. Our third quarter RASM came in right in line with our latest guidance, and we finished the quarter up 1.2% year over year. And there were really two primary drivers of our improved Q3 RASM result compared to our original guidance in July. So first, we had about 2,200 total flight cancellations due to weather during the quarter, and that resulted in about 0.5 point of RASM benefit for the quarter. The weather events were primarily severe storms in late July and early August, and it was very concentrated in Denver and Baltimore, where we obviously have very large, very complex operations, so that was significant. Conversely, though, we only saw a few hundred cancellations due to Hurricane Florence, and the RASM impact of Florence was really immaterial for us. Second and more importantly and more interesting, we saw strong improvements in our passenger yield trends, in particular with close-in bookings, which resulted in a little more than 0.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM. Our new revenue management tools and techniques also contributed to our yield performance and solid RASM results. So for the third quarter, we realized an EBIT benefit of approximately $75 million, which was right in line with our expectations, which is roughly a 1.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM. Now, this benefit was driven primarily by our new O&D revenue management capabilities, but we also saw meaningful benefit from our new pricing capabilities as well. So we are very happy, very, very happy with the performance of our new res system and revenue management capabilities, and we are achieving the benefits that we signed up for and committed to. So in terms of our ancillary revenue performance, we had another really good quarter. As I'm sure you saw in late August, we introduced a new pricing structure for our EarlyBird product, where we moved from a fixed $15 one-way price point to price points of $15, $20, and $25, and the price points are based on a combination of length of haul and EarlyBird demand by market. So it's still early, but so far we've been very pleased with the results. The take rates are right in line with our expectations, which not only results in incremental revenue, but it also allows us to better manage the number of priority boarding positions sold on each flight, which makes the product that much more valuable to our customers. Our Rapid Rewards Program, it continues to strengthen and grow, as well as our business partner revenues, and these categories were again the primary drivers of the 6.6% growth in other revenues in Q3. We are continuing to see strong growth in new Rapid Rewards credit card members as well as strength in credit card spending, both of which were up again double digits year over year. And while it's early, our new credit card, which launched in Q3, is also performing very well, and it's also in line with our expectations. So net of all this is that we had a very strong third quarter. We are very pleased with how our new tools and our new products are performing. Now, let's move on to the fourth quarter. Looking forward, as I said earlier, we are seeing continued revenue strength into the fourth quarter. Our year-over-year capacity growth is planned in the 6% to 6.5% range, which is 2.5 points higher than in Q3. And despite that, we are in fact expecting a sequential improvement in our year-over-year RASM performance in Q4, as Gary said. As I mentioned, I think we'll have a clean year-over-year RASM comparison. So based on our current bookings and yield trends, we expect Q4 RASM to increase in the range of 1% to 2% year over year. Our base business trends continue to be very strong throughout the booking curve. Our passenger yield expectations are, once again, being aided by benefits from O&D revenue management and our new pricing capabilities. And based on the bookings so far, fourth quarter demand appears to be very, very solid and holding up very nicely. So again, we do expect to see some load factor decline, but the net effect should continue to be a positive for RASM performance. We do expect a year-over-year EBIT benefit of $80 million to $90 million in Q4 from our new res system, which gets us to an estimated 1.5 point benefit to Q4 RASM. And that puts us right in line with our annual 2018 EBIT goal of $200 million from our new res system. I'll tell you, I'm very proud of how our revenue management capabilities were delivered on time and on plan. They are working exactly as they were designed. I think the commercial and technology teams did an awesome job. I couldn't be more proud and more pleased and more thankful with the quality of the execution and the results. So in terms of our shoulder flying, as expected, we began to reduce our shoulder flying beginning in Q3, and the reduction continues into Q4. In particular, we did reduce our deep shoulder flying, and this is flying before 6 :00 AM and after 10 :00 PM, just as a reminder. And with this reduction in deep shoulder flying, we are not seeing a RASM drag in Q4 from our schedule, and we expect deep shoulder flying to subside further as we move into 2019. So to wrap it up, I am very pleased with the trends that we're seeing in the back half of 2018. And as Gary said, barring any unforeseen events, this sets us up very well and very nicely as we head into 2019. And finally, we are very, very anxious, very eager for our upcoming launch to Hawaii. And we are ready to go with our flight schedules once we receive the necessary approvals. So with that, I will turn it over to Mike Van de Ven for our operations update. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon to some of you all and morning to others. As you guys know, the third quarter is a transition period for the operation, and we began the quarter with very heavy summer flying. We had just over 4,000 flights a day at the beginning of the quarter, and we ended up in late August and September timeframe with just under that amount. And the operation is often impacted in this period by a combination of high load factors and weather, and this year just wasn't any different. We had a tough last half of July and early August with 2,200 weather-related cancellations as Tom mentioned. In addition to those cancellations, though, we experienced more weather-related ATC/Block delays this July than we had in any July over the last 10 years. So despite that difficult environment, our people were just, they were magnificent. And I think we delivered superb operational performance for the quarter. We expect to finish fourth in the DoT on-time performance for the quarter, and that's based on our marketing carrier results. And that's an improvement of three spots over last year. We set a third quarter record for the lowest percentage of mishandled bags in our history. And our DoT complaints that have been reported through August were at 5-year lows and are down 24.5% from last year. And just as a reminder we were number one in the industry last year. In our fuel efficiency, as Gary mentioned, continues to grow in terms of the ASMs we produced per gallon. And we're improving at about 1.1%. And again that's primarily as a result of our fleet modernization efforts. So we've had very strong operational results in terms of reliability and hospitality. I think that will continue into the fourth quarter. And we're going to spend more time, as Gary mentioned, focusing towards our efficiency and cost opportunities as we move forward. A couple other highlights in the third quarter, we announced that we are partnering with the State of Maryland to build a maintenance hangar in Baltimore. That's going to house three Boeing 737s inside the hangar and will also provide us with additional parking spots of up to eight airplanes overnight. That's our first hangar in the Northeast and it's really a needed addition to one of our busiest cities. We've also previously announced our intent to add both a pilot and a flight attendant crew base in Los Angeles and those will be open and up here in December and the first part of next year. And that will in part support our Hawaii efforts. And then speaking of Hawaii, it's our expansion focus for next year. And just subject to the timing of our ETOPS certification from the FAA, our goal continues still to be to sell tickets at the end of this year and operate flights early next year. So, with that brief update, Tammy, I think I'll just turn it over to you. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Right. Thank you, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Moving right into cost, our third quarter CASM, excluding special items, increased 4.1% year over year, driven in part by a nearly 9% increase in our hedged fuel costs. Our hedged fuel price per gallon remains steady at $2.25 and that's despite an increase in market jet fuel prices during the quarter. Our hedged jet fuel remains in line with our guidance due to more material hedging gains that kicked in at higher prices. The $0.04 net hedge benefit consisted of $0.10 of hedging gains offset by $0.06 of premium costs. For fourth quarter and based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.30 to $2.35 range. This guidance includes an estimated $0.07 net hedging benefit including $0.14 of hedging gains offset by $0.07 of premium costs. The $0.10 sequential increase in our estimated fourth quarter fuel price normalizing for the hedging gains is largely due to the increase in market prices. For 2019, we are also well prepared with a 63% hedge in protection beginning at $70 Brent crude equivalent with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and continue to increase well above $100 per barrel. Our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in market price decline. For full year 2019 based on market prices last Friday and our current hedging positions, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.35 to $2.40 range with an estimated $0.08 hedging gain and $0.04 premium cost. We expect 2019 fuel hedge premium costs, which is included in fuel and oil expense to be approximately $80 million or $0.04 per gallon and down from this year. As Mike said, we continue to benefit from increased fuel efficiency from our fleet modernization. Our third quarter available seat mile per gallon, which is our key fuel efficiency metric improved by 1.1% year over year. As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly behind our 2018 goal of 2% to 3% primarily due to our utilization of the -700 fleet to cover our fleet deficit and suboptimal flight schedule. As our schedule becomes more optimized and as we take on more MAX aircraft and began the retirement cycle of the 700, we expect the fuel efficiency profile of our fleet to continue to improve. In fact, I expect sequential improvement in our fourth quarter year-over-year fuel efficiency more in line with what we were expecting for the full year. I'm going to move on to third and fourth quarter our non-fuel costs and I'll talk in more detail about 2019 at the end of my prepared remarks. When you strip out fuel profit sharing and special items, our unit cost inflation in the third quarter was in line with our expectations. As we previously disclosed in our investor update our third quarter unit costs were impacted by weather-related flight cancellations, resulting in about 1 point reduction in ASM. When combined with modest weather-related costs, the flight cancellations resulted in a nearly 1 point year-over-year negative impact to CASM. We ended up at the lower end of our CASM guidance, primarily due to approximately $10 million of spending that shifted into the fourth quarter and beyond. The shifts are primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and technology spending. Aside from shifting, the other cost categories were pretty much in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM outlook looks good, particularly from the easier comparisons that we had with last year's tax reform year-end bonus. Despite some cost pressure from shifting of spend out of the first half and third quarter, fourth quarter year-over-year CASM excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing is expected to be flat to up 1%. We've also had some capacity cuts here in fourth quarter, so we do have some related cost pressures. Netting out the moving parts, our full year 2018 CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items remains unchanged. Our balance sheet remains very strong and investment-grade credit rating and with ample liquidity and we also have very healthy cash flows. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $3.9 billion. We've invested $1.4 billion back into the business thus far in 2018. And for full year 2018 CapEx, we continue to expect to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range. And we are planning for a similar level of CapEx for 2019. So far in 2018, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $332 million in dividends. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched in the third quarter and just completed earlier this month. This most recent ASR completed our previous $2 billion share repurchase authorization and the first $150 million from our new $2 billion authorization. So we have $1.85 billion remaining. Over the past five years we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends, supporting our commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders. So, overall I'm very pleased with our continued approach to capital deployment with appropriate balance. We intend to continue investing back in the business while focusing on opportunities to drive further value, and we continue to have great opportunities to do so in particular with further investments in fleet modernization. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we also intend to continue returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with our excess cash. Regarding our fleet plan, we made some slight tweaks to our order book recently. First as planned, we took delivery of five Boeing 737-800 aircraft and seven MAX 8s in the quarter and we continue to expect to end the year with 751 aircraft. During third quarter, we signed leases on an additional four MAX 8 aircraft with delivery in 2019. We still have 27 firm orders with Boeing for 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 aircraft next year. And now we have 7 leased MAX 8s coming next year as well for a total of 34 aircraft in 2019. As we've previously shared, we're planning to designate some of our 737-700 aircraft for retirement next year to support our continued investment in fleet modernization. These additional aircraft acquisitions or any future opportunities to pick up a few additional new aircraft for fleet replacement do not change our previously communicated 2019 capacity plan. On the capacity side with the storm cancellations in the third quarter, we are now planning for our 2018 capacity to increase approximately 4% with fourth quarter ASMs up in the 6% to 6.5% range year over year. And we continue to plan for 2019 capacity to increase no more than 5% year over year, which is unchanged. Our schedule is currently published through early June 2019 and they exclude expected Hawaii flying. You can see that excluding Hawaii our January through May year-over-year ASM growth is modest. In regards to 2019 cost, and as Gary mentioned, we are expecting full year 2019 CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase at least 3% year over year. The key drivers of our year-over-year unit cost pressures in 2019 are primarily due to operations, staffing demand and healthcare inflation, which is driving an increase in salary, wages and benefits. Increased maintenance expense driven in part by expected timing of maintenance events. Airport cost increase is driven in part by airport infrastructure investments and continued heavy investments in technology focused primarily on operational investments. Much of the cost inflation we are seeing here in the second half 2018 is continuing into next year. Of course, I'm adjusting our current fourth quarter 2018 unit cost trends for higher fourth quarter capacity growth as well as fourth quarter 2017's tax reform employee bonus and charitable contribution, which was about 3 points to fourth quarter 2017. So our current growth rate continues into next year and we will shift our number one focus to control cost in 2019 to arrest that trend. In closing, we had an excellent third quarter and we were able to expand our net margin and deliver record third quarter earnings per share. These are notable achievements in the industry and I'd like to thank our more than 58,000 employees for their outstanding efforts. I am very pleased with our rebound in revenue trends in third quarter and our continued momentum thus far in fourth quarter. Our fuel hedging gains have offset a significant portion of higher market jet fuel prices so far this year and will continue to provide protection, especially if prices continue to rise. While we face some unit cost inflation next year, I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us to more efficiently scale our growth and drive further productivity and efficiencies and this will be a primary focus for us next year. We strive to continue delivering very healthy margins, as we continue to invest in our future. We continue to deliver high returns on invested capital and that will remain a top priority. With that Abby, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin with our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, Gary, let me start with the revenue question, if I could. And I appreciate your willingness to provide some initial thoughts on RASM growth next year. I guess as we sort of do the math for 2019 to get to margin expansion, you will need to see at least 3.5% RASM growth or so. Could you kind of talk through some of the specific initiatives on the revenue side that you think will help get you there? And I would just be curious to know your level of conviction behind the ability to drive margin expansion next year? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, obviously, great question Jack. I think we're very motivated. And I admitted in my opening remarks that the confidence level we have with revenue forecast 15 months from now or 14 months from now can't be that high relative to our confidence level on the cost side of things. So we admit that going in. Revenues can be tough to predict. And I think just couching it in those terms based on what we see right now and based on the plans that are already underway we're very convicted to that. So, Tom, is here and leads our commercial organization along with Andrew Watterson and Ryan Green and we're well along in our planning for 2019. The specifics are pretty much what you know. And I thought Tom was very clear in his report that we had a plan for 2018. We're delivering against that plan remarkably well, remarkably accurately, I guess, I can say. And we're looking forward to the full year benefit of many of those things for 2019. And so if you like Tom can sort of renumerate what those are. In terms of new revenue streams for 2019, we don't have anything to report there today. I did tease last time that we are busy working on the next stream of initiatives. And it will be next year before we're ready to talk about those. So you'll have to stay tuned on that. And Tom as I'm thinking out loud, I don't know that anything new will necessarily come online in 2019. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I think what we're seeing is the ancillary products are growing in a pace faster than our core business and our credit card business is very, very strong and such. I think it starts with just the close-in current environment is very, very strong and I think that one of our areas of focus is just that just focus, focus, execute and drive that into 2019. And I think what we're seeing is the initiatives are paying off. I think that our One Res initiative whether it's O&D bid pricing or the pricing capabilities, the credit cards, the ancillary, these things are paying off. We're seeing real strength in our corporate sales business. That's a really bright spot for us. And I think when you look at some of this more broad-based of our key focus cities, there's just real economic strength and the performance is outstanding. So we got our work in front of us but I feel very, very good about what we know at this point. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I think, said just a little different way, based on what our plan is for 2019 we're not depending on new things that we have no experience with. Now, from a macro perspective, it's not necessarily trying to give you a read on what we think about the economy next year. If you'll just forgive that, I mean, our guess is as good as yours I suppose. But we're not assuming any change in the economy and broader industry demand. As we look at the industry macro levers, supply and demand, I think are in pretty nice balance right now, and I don't think that that will get out of balance next year. But it's a pretty strong environment right now, and I think we have some easier comps, to be blunt, in the first half of next year. That was pointed out by one of your colleagues last time, and we fully acknowledge that. So that's a factor, but it makes the at least 3% RASM growth I think a very viable goal. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, the 3% \u2013 I guess at least 3% CASM ex-growth for next year doesn't include any of the efficiencies that you guys are trying to zero in on now. First of all, is that correct? And I guess is there the potential that you can maybe offset some of those inflationary costs that Tammy laid out in her comments with some efficiencies that you can maybe come back to us with later on? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: That is correct. And based on what we know right now, I don't think we're willing to commit to anything different than what we've said. Now clearly Jack, we'll be working very hard on this, and we'll owe you and the world an update on our progress, and I would say, Ryan, in 60 days. I'll leave it up to Investor Relations exactly what we'll do next. But we're not done with our 2019 plan and I haven't done this for a long time with you all. I don't remember a time where we ever gave you this much advance insight into the following year. But this one was different enough that quite frankly we felt the obligation for full disclosure here. So this is where we are. I'm not going to say I don't like it because I'm just not satisfied with it. And I think I was also trying to articulate for everyone the perspective that wow, our folks are doing a really good job on so many other dimensions. It's hard to say that you don't like it. But clearly, it's a result that we can't be satisfied with. We need to be a low-cost producer. And if anything, our goal is to drive our unit cost down and not up and certainly up that much. So I gave you an array of things at least to give you some insight as to what we would be attacking here. And I'm going to ask \u2013 I've already had a number of volunteers to take on the new initiatives here, and Tom and Mike will head that up. And I'll be asking them to devote a significant amount of their time to these efforts. The balance or the trick here is to keep everything in balance. So we don't want to chase this challenge and all of a sudden let our on-time performance degrade our customer service. And that's why I think the perspective and the balance is correct. So we'll want to make some smart decisions here. But clearly, we can't be satisfied with that kind of unit cost inflation, and we're not. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Gary, thanks again for the time. Operator : We will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, a couple of questions, not surprisingly I guess on the unit cost side, Gary, Tammy. So I guess first in terms of the 2019 guide and that 3% number, it seems like that may be an up around just given some of the initiatives that you're going to push out there, Gary, in terms of an opportunity? That's one. And then the second part of it is, as you think about unit cost over the next few years, is 2019 now going to be an anomaly, or should we think of Southwest as now having higher costs over the next few years? Because, Gary, you did make some comments about Southwest being transformed versus its history and that sort of a thing. So I wasn't sure as to what you were trying to message there. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I was just \u2013 and thanks for that question. It's another really good one. Because I do want to be as clear, and I know Tammy does too, as we can on where we are for 2019. It was really just a perspective that a lot of investment and initiatives have occurred over the last decade. Our load factor, Mike, I'm going to have to guess off the top of my head a decade ago was 10 points lower. So some of the cost that we're incurring today as compared to 2008 are simply because we have a lot more customers per departure. We have a lot more bags. And so some of these cost increases, in other words, are acceptable to me, if you want to describe it that way. There's a lot more to it than that, but most of our transformational efforts were geared towards driving more revenue, and we have been very, very successful with that. We had a huge investment in a new frequent flyer program, ultimately followed on by a huge investment in a new reservation system. And, Tom, as far as I know, the reservation system, which is very valuable, only increases our unit cost. So it is significantly more costly than what we had before. But the business case is really solid. It's just paid for on the revenue side. So that's all I meant there. And then just admitting to you and everyone that for us to manage our cost more aggressively, it's just going to have to take the higher priority and just a lot more elbow grease, because the cost \u2013 we are optimizing our schedule, but what we are not realizing is the cost efficiencies that go along with that. And we're going to have to work hard to achieve that. So the other thing I would speak to is \u2013 I was very careful with the words. What we are telling you is we're looking at least 3%. So I'm not ready to provide any more information than that because that is all I feel like we can accurately tell you at this point. So that's really the report today. And then as we finish up our planning and as we do identify and commit to some initiatives here, we'll have a much better number. Again, I'll defer to Investor Relations over the next 60 to 90 days, and we'll update you there. So hopefully that answers your question. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It does. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you very much. Hey, good morning everybody. Gary, you mentioned obviously the initiative to drive productivity, but you also said that you may have to de-prioritize certain other things to drive that productivity. What were you talking about? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, nothing specific, Hunter. It was just acknowledging that a company or its leaders or its people can only do so many things at one time. We've got a really good multiyear program planned in terms of strategic initiatives. A lot of it involves technology construction. And at least for this era, for Southwest, a lot of it involves new technology or replacement technology for Mike Van de Ven and our operations team. So we've starved them a little bit over the last decade because again our focus was more on the commercial side. So it's simply to admit that if we're going to have a major cost initiative or two or three or four, something may have to give. And I don't have anything specific in mind, but my colleagues will confirm. I've been worried for some time that, as usual, we have more things that we want to do than we have capacity to complete. So something may have to give there. So it's just \u2013 if you were to come back and ask the uninformed question of how are you going to fit these things in, I think that that's part of what we have to figure out here over the next 60 days is what might make sense. And of course, none of our leaders want to give up on anything because they're all individually very good ideas. So, it's not necessarily to warn you, it is basically just to say that's where we are in this task that we're going to have to crowbar it in on our to-do list here somehow and it's got to bear fruit. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just a modeling question. I believe you guys accrue for the mechanics deal, but obviously they rejected the deal. I'm not asking you to tell me where you are in those negotiations, but can you just help us know \u2013 help us understand how much of that accrual was in the 2018 CASM? Is that hitting the 2019 CASM number, any color you can provide there? Thanks, I appreciate it. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure, I'm happy to take that. Yes, we've incorporated all of our any anticipated rate increases, our agreements into the guidance that we provided this morning. So you've got all of that baked in, which I would point out based on what I've read from some of the other carriers, I noticed that not all the carriers have incorporated that into their guidance. So, what we've given you is fully loaded with our expectations. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Just a question maybe on the cost side, but on the holistic view here, if I look at pre-tax margin, it's down about 2 points year-over-year, down about 4 points versus kind of the peak which is a low fuel price environment. Given kind of this \u2013 assuming the current conditions continue, no change in the environment, how long do you think it takes to recapture or get back to maybe even last year's pre-tax margins? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Savi, I feel like we have really recaptured our fuel cost increase here. We've got a nice hedge that's mitigating that and that's properly covering 25% or so of the \u2013 if you compare our hedge versus the increase in market prices I feel like we're recovering a nice chunk of that just from our fuel hedge. And of course from a revenue perspective we're performing well there. So to deliver this quarter margin expansion we're really proud of that. So we feel like we have largely recovered that. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Tammy, I think you're talking about net income and I'm talking about pre-tax. And it's not like we're going to... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes, excuse me. On a pre-tax margin, I think that goes back to just our earlier discussion on the cost, Savi. We're going to have to work through that here in our planning process to offset some of the headwinds. But we delivered on all of our guidance here in the third quarter. And, again, we're kind of focused on the pre-tax margin and again delivered on a very solid margin both operating and on a pre-tax basis. So we'll keep working at that. But pre-tax and after-tax, we feel like we're largely recovering that to the bottom-line. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Let me see if this is in line with what you're asking. The goal is to \u2013 I think there's \u2013 it's sort of multifaceted. But every year we have a goal to grow our unit revenues. And then I would say from that we have a goal to hit an overall return on invested capital target, which we well exceeded that for a handful of years here. But that is always a goal year-in, year-out. So then within that there would always be a goal to grow earnings and at least sustain if not grow margins. The tax savings is real. So, I don't \u2013 it's a little hard and I would debate this with you Savi, it's a little hard to think about pre-tax margins today compared to a period where tax rates were higher because there is some interchange between the tax savings and pre-tax margins. They haven't been competed away at Southwest, but hopefully you get the point there. It's just not \u2013 it doesn't all just drop to the bottom line over a period of time. But the main point here in the near term with the early guidance that we're giving you for 2019 is that our goal is to at least sustain and hopefully grow our margins for next year. And it doesn't matter of course in that sense whether you're talking about pre or post-tax. But in terms of trying to \u2013 I don't think we have gone back and took a prior year margin and said how will that compare to 2019 or 2020 or 2021. We just haven't done that. And in fairness to Tammy's answer. So what we are focused on is \u2013 just so again everybody is clear, we had a really good plan for the third quarter and we executed. Now we have a really good plan for the fourth quarter and we're going to focus on executing that. And in the meantime we're going to finish our plans for 2019 with elements that aren't satisfactory to us and then come back with a firm plan for 2019 that we will give you again a lot more update and insight into. But at least preliminarily those are our goals and right now they don't seem unachievable. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and finalizing our plan. And again there's more information to come on that. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. If I might just quickly ask a modeling question from Tammy. Just the $521 million in free market value in 2019-plus could you give me that like 2019 and 2020, the breakdown of that? Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yes. It's \u2013 yes. For 2019, it's roughly $270 million. And I'll share 2020 that's about $175 million. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, great. Thank you, both. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey! Good morning, everybody. And Gary, just on this cost issue the challenge that I'm having is really gauging the urgency around the topic, and I think, it's pretty high. But your response earlier to Jack's question suggested that you'd plan to use the current toolbox to extract sufficient revenue as to ensure margin growth. I guess my question is if that toolbox is inadequate for whatever reason, how willing are you to think outside the box? And look I don't even know how to define that. Maybe offering a higher fare that would guarantee a seat in the first three rows. I suppose at the very extreme it extends to M&A. I don't \u2013 that's up to you. I understand your earlier comment was that you didn't have to plan anything new. My question is have you ruled out that possibility of doing something there? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I love the question and especially the opportunity to try to clarify that. Oh! Yeah, we will absolutely need to continue to innovate and challenge ourselves and think about ways to bring on new revenue streams. That work is already underway. At least with the way we were coming into the planning season here for 2019, I wasn't thinking that we would want to attempt to deploy anything new in a more urgent way along the way you've asked the question. I think, it's very reasonable... Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...you asked your question that way, and so I would agree with you that that would be a consideration. Now some of the things that we haven't shared with you have a build to them. And there we \u2013 we can't turn them on January 1 to be fair to the things that we do have in our minds that we want to pursue. That doesn't include the other kinds of things that we might dream up that say you know what we need to do this and we are going to do it January 1. So all of that is in play. I'm very glad you asked the question. The main focus I want to have though is on the cost side of things. And I have always had in my mind that at some point it will need to be a higher priority. And as I pointed out in my remarks the time is now. We are not seeing the kinds of efficiencies here as we begin to trim the schedule back that I was counting on and so we're just going to have to work that much harder to do that. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful, Gary. And second, with Hawaiian yields under pressure at the moment, I'm just curious if internally you've downwardly revised your forecast in response to that. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: No. Okay. We feel very good about Hawaii, and the work. I think, Tom and Mike, both commented on the status of that work there. So... Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Hey. Thanks. Gary, the press release reads like all of the 2019 cost increase is discretionary. Can you segment for us how much of the three points is inflation versus investments you are electing to make? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, I may have to go back and reread it and reflect on your interpretation there. But, Tammy, you can help me explain here. I think the... Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: ...part of what we were \u2013 and I think, Tammy and I have both covered it. But just to make sure we've been clear, there are known cost increases coming into 2019. So, we've been spending money on airports. Mike retired the classics and bought new airplanes to replace those. So there are line items that will see cost increases. We know about that. And that's what I was trying to point out. Those investments have been made. We've implemented a new reservation system. That depreciation is flowing through on and on. So those things are known. The airline also has not in many cases added enough capacity yet to absorb some of these step increases and investments. Some of them are very, very fixed. And as time goes by, you will see unit cost declines, and of course, I know you can imagine what those are. So the opportunities for us are \u2013 they're classic opportunities. It is our corporate overhead, which is much more discretionary than having \u2013 as compared to frontline operations. But operations is key here. It's having a very high-quality schedule that Mike delivers really good on on-time performance that helps keep cost down. And then, we just need to turn airplanes efficiently. We need to have efficient en route times. All of those things combined to produce very efficient and low-cost operations, which we're famous for. So, there's always opportunities to go in and fix things. And again the challenge for us is to make sure that we don't make changes that mess something else up unintentionally. So we've got a very good schedule right now. And just thinking about 2019, we're very enthused about its revenue producing capabilities. It may be a little harder for Mike to staff it and to operate it, and so we just want to again try to keep these in balance, so there are things that our commercial team can do to perhaps make it easier on the operation from a staffing perspective. And a classic example would be we have a lot of originating flights early in the morning at an airport and then nothing for them to do all day long until the airport goes to sleep. That may be great for revenue, but it's not the most efficient from operating the airport just to give you some color into what we mean. And we'll be pursuing all of those opportunities and our folks already have a plethora of ideas to pursue. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : That's helpful color. And then just to follow-up, why would IT drive operating expense? Is it just depreciation? I thought there was a big training investment that was going to kind of roll off as these systems mature. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, there is \u2013 if you just think about the reservation system and we've shared that cost $500 million many, many times, not all of that got capitalized and not all of that flows through over time through depreciation expense. And it is beyond me to explain to you those rules on which one is which. But in \u2013 while we are currently working on developing a lot of technology for our operations team as an example, there is \u2013 I'm searching for the right word. Our costs do balloon as all this work is underway. We need extra help. And sometimes it shows up in consulting and professional services, maybe some other software firms or whatever it might be. And it also flows through the business side. So these technology projects are wonderful, but they are very expensive. And so not all of that \u2013 Tammy off the top of your head I don't know if you have a rule of thumb. But it's \u2013 I mean, it's not even 50% capitalized. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. It's 60%. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: It is 60%. Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. And just to add to \u2013 just to help you out where some of these pressures are going to manifest in the P&L, certainly we do expect some headwinds in our depreciation. And that is from the investments in the technologies that we've been making here. So you'll see some \u2013 we'll see some headwinds there in depreciation and amortization related specifically to the technologies. And then of course salary, wages and benefits is where you'll see some pressure as well on a unit cost basis year over year as we work to absorb some of the investments that we've made here over the past number of years. So \u2013 and I would expect salary, wages and benefits to be the most significant driver of our unit cost pressure next year. So \u2013 and some of that will fall out in other as well. So we don't \u2013 again we're \u2013 I'm not ready to give specific line item guidance today because we're still working our way through the plan, but at least directionally that will \u2013 can maybe help you with your modeling. And then just another thought that I had as Gary was talking just as we look ahead to 2019 and just thinking about some of the inefficiencies that we've at least talked about, we'll \u2013 and as we grow into that we would expect to absorb some of that. But our \u2013 just one note on our 2019 ASM guidance of no more than 5%, as I mentioned that does include Hawaii flying. And that's estimated to be about half or so I mean of our planned year-over-year growth. And you \u2013 and I know a lot of you look at our \u2013 follow the Diio schedules. If you look out at Diio, you can see that our capacity without Hawaii is quite modest. And I think they're trending in the 1% to 3% range without that Hawaii flying. So we're anxious to start our Hawaii flying and ramp up our schedule there. So hopefully that provides a little more color as you're trying to complete your models there. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And Duane, you remind me of an earlier question that I don't think I ever answered. I know we're over our time. So I'll try to be quick year. But there was a question about whether or not this was sort of a transitional year and the inflation goes away post 2019. And that may very well be. I don't think we are prepared to give you an answer on that yet because obviously the 2019 information is important to you and is new information. And we want \u2013 I want us to be comfortable that whatever we tell you that will happen next that we've done enough work to be able to support that. But I do think that that's a reasonable thought that this is somewhat transitional. But we need to be comfortable with that. Obviously, we do long-range plans. But the longer they are the less certain we are that they are realistic. So we'll want to revisit those longer-term plans now that 2019 has come more into focus before we answer that question. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI : Okay, thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And, Ryan, I think we'll give it back to you. I beg your pardon, one more question. Operator : We have time for one more question. And we will take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. It looks like the pressure is really on. So I just have a question actually as you think about Hawaii service for next year. When we're looking at the bookings for that, when you start to look at bookings for that, what are you thinking about in terms of redeemed Rapid Rewards versus people actually paying for those flights? Because I would imagine a lot of your customers are chomping at the bit to start booking and are saving up Rapid Rewards for exactly that. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I don't know, I'll let Tom guess on this too. And maybe Tom and Andrew have some sense of what other airlines see. We have a different frequent flyer program. Every seat every day is available for redemption, and it's de facto revenue managed. It takes more points to make a booking the week of travel than it does to get an advance purchase ticket. So there are natural revenue management controls over that. But I think they would also tell you that we're really indifferent where those awards get used. The accounting has changed, so that the revenue recognition doesn't penalize that. So in other words, you won't see it. And our assumption is our customers earned these points and they're going to fly them somewhere. If they want to fly to Hawaii or they want to fly to Amarillo, it's all good by me. But I can't imagine a scenario like the old days, people were worried about we're going to fill this whole airplane up with zero paying frequent flyers. I can't imagine that scenario. But if it happens that way, you still won't see a problem. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: Helene, my guess is you'll see a lot of Rapid Reward redemptions early on, a lot. We've been acquiring customers and credit card holders for the past year very, very intentionally. And they just, as you said, are building their points up. And as Gary said, we don't care. We would love to have that plane full of passengers. Whether it's a cash passenger or a Rapid Reward passenger, I'm indifferent. They are good customers and we're getting our financial piece out of that sale. That's how I think about it. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'll make one other quick business argument to you, which will hopefully give you \u2013 if you're not convinced yet, more comfort, which is remember, the awards are earned in two basic methods. One is you can fly and get a point, but you can also spend money with a credit card and get a point, and for those we get paid. So the way we look at it, whenever we have a redemption, it's not zero dollars coming in. It's realizing the deferred revenue or the air traffic liability that was already received by Chase in payment of those points. So maybe some customers literally have \u2013 they're taking a \"free ticket,\" but most of them have a blend of credit card and flights. And so that makes it even easier to get comfortable that it's a good business decision for the company to manage the frequent flyer program this way. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, that's great. Thank you so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. And, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Abby, thank you. I think we'll go and get started with the media portion of our Q&A. So if you would, give them instructions on how to queue up for a question. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin with our first question from Conor Shine with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: I was wondering if you can provide any more information about what stage of the ETOPS certification process you guys are at. And then once that is presumably granted by the FAA, what kind of timeframe are you looking at between getting that approval and actually operating flights? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: I'll give you an update on the certification process, I will talk on the commercial side. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: So. Conor, I think Tom and I are going to double team on this. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Okay. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: So the ETOPS process takes around 12 to 18 months. That's generally the scheduled time for that process, and we're coming up on just about 12 months of work in there to date. So we have made \u2013 continue to make steady progress with the FAA on it. And I would say that we have completed really the regulatory reviews of the manuals. And we've got the feedback from the FAA and made the changes, and we are transitioning now from the design and documentation of our ETOPS procedures into what I would call a demonstration phase. And that's characterized by us doing tabletop exercises with the FAA and then ultimately validation flights. And so we're in the process right now of trying to get those tabletops and those validation flights scheduled. So we've got a couple of months to still do that before the end of the year. Hopefully, after we get that done and we would have the certification in place, then we will begin the process of selling the tickets and trying to book up. So we've got the resources and the locations ready in Hawaii. We've got the equipment there. We have our people bid and staffed, ready to go out there. And as soon as we get the approval from the FAA, we can start our training program with our people. And so on the operations side we'll be ready and then we'll just coordinate with the commercial side of the business. Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: I think, Conor, that once we get that certification, we're ready to go. Andrew and the commercial team have been working on the schedule and how that builds over time and how quickly that kind of thing, it's a great schedule. We're excited to get out there. But once we get the certification, then we'll publish the schedule and it will be flying within weeks or a month, I would think. Back to what Mike was saying, our facilities are ready to go. Our teams are over there. The aircraft are ready, and we've been working on this for quite a while. So we are really just chomping at the bit ready to go once Mike pulls that trigger and says okay, commercial, we've got a go. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So, Conor, from the time we get the certification, it's days to publish is the way to think about it. And then what Tom was describing there is from the date that we then publish, we could be flying in weeks. I think a lot of that, when we fly we'll be more dependent upon what is the calendar. We don't want to start flying on Christmas Day, as an example. So that will be a factor. But anyway, you get the idea. There won't be a long timeline once we get the approval. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Thank you. Hey, Mike, I wanted to see if you could give an update on the engine fan blade inspections, how those have been going, and if you have continued to find any cracked blades. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Sure. Sure, Mary. So if you don't mind, I'll maybe just give everybody just a quick refresher course on the program because it's fairly complicated. But we do have roughly, as you know, Mary, 35,000 fan blades probably supporting our fleet. And the inspection program that's mandated out there today is to do recurring inspections every 1,600 cycles. And the inspection technique you use with that is an ultrasonic inspection technique. And so the engine remains attached to the wing of the airplane, and we do it on overnight checks with the airplane. And that inspection technique is designed to tack cracks as small as 0.016 of an inch. Then in addition to those when the engines comes off for overhaul at the normal overhaul period, an Eddy current inspection is done, and that will detect a crack down to 0.021 inch. And so both of those detection capabilities give us multiple opportunities to identify cracks in any blade out there long before they would become an issue. So, Mary, as you know, after we had 1380, a big fleet-wide inspection program not only just at Southwest Airlines but worldwide. And so we had identified some of the cracks during that process. But now we've got the steady stream in state, and we have not found any cracks with that UTI inspection process during our steady state of 1,600 cycles. But we did last month during a normal engine overhaul, there was a crack found with an Eddy current inspection. And again that was a small crack and so long before it became an issue. So I think we should expect that on an ongoing basis, we'll find one or two of our 35,000 blades cracked through these processes. But that's why we're doing them. And I feel really good about the program that we have in place and I think we are hopefully killing it at this point in time. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Mary, the only thing that I would add just for emphasis is that, we know enough now to expect that a very small number of blades will show up with a crack. So that's what Mike is saying. That's what the protocol is for. I think that we and the manufacturer have been delighted with the success that we're having with our procedure. And again what Mike was describing with Eddy current, CFM or GE, I guess, does that. We don't do the Eddy current test and that's only done at the engine overhaul step, Mike... Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's right. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But it's working as designed and we would expect to find a couple of cracks every year. Don't you think, Mike? Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. Great, thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: And Mary when you and I talked earlier, I may have misspoke, by the way. You were asking me about the flight cancellations. And I thought most of those were attributable to Florence. And I think Mike was pointing out \u2013 I don't know if you heard his report earlier, but most of that, it sounds like, Mike, was in Denver and Baltimore. Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.: That's right. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: So I just want to \u2013 if that was important to you, I want to make sure that you know that I was a little off-track on my answer earlier. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters : Hi. When you talk about identifying new revenue streams, can you just give us a little more direction of what you're analyzing? Is the possibility of charging bag fees on the table? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Yeah, I don't mind doing that. I'm not going to give you much information, but I would say so that your mind doesn't go there that we're not thinking charging for bags. We're not thinking about charging change fees. The good news is, we have other opportunities that we can explore that will actually enhance the Southwest brand and not detract from it. So that will absolutely be our goal. And by the way, I'll just quickly add, I don't think it would be revenue positive for us to charge for bags. That's sort of implied by my earlier comment. We like the fact that it's more customer-friendly, but we also believe that we get more customers and therefore more revenues by that approach. And it helps to be the only airline that does that. So it provides a bit of \u2013 interestingly some distinctiveness that we've, I think, capitalized on very well. Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters : Okay. Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: But otherwise, I can't really give you any other teasers as to what we are up to until it's ready for primetime. And that's \u2013 sorry, it's just not ready yet. Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters : Okay. Operator : We will take our next question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider - The Wall Street Journal : Thanks. Yeah. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, how you're seeing the mix between business and leisure travelers right now. If you're sort of depending more on business travelers and close-in bookings to drive more of your revenue, and if you're seeing any pullback from leisure if that's sort of behind some of the drop in the load factor? Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.: This is Tom, Alison. We're seeing strength in both leisure and business. In fact, what we're really seeing, it's not just strength in both of them, but we're seeing our corporate sales slice of business really perform very nicely. And I think part of that does have to do with some of the revenue management techniques and tools we talked about earlier in terms of some of our pricing techniques and our ability to create higher value itinerary result kind of stuff. But bottom line is I'm getting to revenue management behind you. I think that our corporate business is really performing really nicely. We are seeing very strong performance there in terms of loads and in terms of fares in passenger. And I think that our leisure business just continues to perform nicely. So at 84% load factor, which is down a point, isn't bad, we still carry worth 40 million passengers. So we feel really good about that, but the mix is very strong and our business mix is really picking up. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: If it's kind of a broader economic, sort of more macro insight question which we get often, we're not seeing any signs of economic weakness and demand is very strong. I agree with Tom, that the business versus leisure mix is very strong. Corporate sales is a real outlier with its strength and it's just an overall very good report. Alison Sider - The Wall Street Journal : Thanks. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with FlightGlobal. Please go ahead. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned just now that Southwest saw some revenue weakness in Mexico in the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about that? How bad was it? Is it getting better from the airlines perspective? And what is Southwest doing to work against it? Thank you. Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: Well, yeah, a great question. And of course, I'll just talk more broadly if you don't mind about our international segment and it's relatively small. It's only roughly 3.5% of our capacity. But Mexico in particular is off trend. And really it's not just the third quarter. It's this year. And I think the rest of the industry has been reporting the same thing. I did share with you that if you just take domestic versus international, our domestic performance was RASM up 2.3%. If my memory is accurate it'll be close at least on the international segment on really a modest capacity increase overall, but the international segment was down about 3.5%. So it's a pretty big gap between international and domestic. I'm a believer in Mexico and we've had a really strong demand up until this year from leisure customers going to the beaches. And I think that will return, but I think we've seen a pretty widespread weakness across the travel industry. And you could speculate on the reasons as well as I could but consumers have options, and if they feel like they've got better options, they'll go other places. So it may have in fact helped our business in other Caribbean beach destinations for all I know. But in any event, we're definitely seeing \u2013 like the rest of the industry, we're definitely seeing a weakness this year. And I don't see any signs of that abating dramatically, but it does sound like it's not getting worse and maybe we'll see some strengthening here. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Right. Are you planning to cut any capacity on those flights to Mexico? Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.: We're not ready to make any cuts at this point. The only thing that I would say is that \u2013 and Tammy made this very clear with her comments with the analyst is that our focus with our \u2013 not more than 5% growth in 2019 \u2013 is Hawaii. And so we're not planning on adding any meaningful amount of international flying in 2019 because of that. But we haven't shared whether we plan to trim any routes and that's something that we routinely do. But again, there's nothing to share about that at this point. Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal: Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.: Thanks, Abby, and thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, the communications team is standing by. You can reach them by phone at 214-792-4847 or via our media website at swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Annual 2018 Conference Call. My name is Greg, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Greg, and welcome, everyone. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO and other members of our senior leadership team. Please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements and those are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current expectations. And we'll also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. So for more information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP, please visit the Investor Relations section of southwest.com. Before we get started, I want to provide an update on the cadence of our planned investor updates for 2019. Beginning this year, we will discontinue the leasing month and traffic statistics, however, we will continue to practice we began last year providing a quarterly investor update in the last month of each quarter that would be March, June, September and December typically around mid-month. So with that intro, I will turn the call over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan and thanks everyone for joining us for the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. The earnings were outstanding -- an outstanding way to close an important but a very challenging year. I'm very grateful to all of our Southwest people. They are extraordinary and they really showed their resilience and their fortitude. They did an exceptional job and they have set us up very, very well for what ought to be a banner and a record year in 2019. Our celebration is bittersweet; this is the first earnings report in history of Southwest Airlines without our beloved Herb Kelleher. It is a huge loss for us. It is a huge loss of course for Herb's family and really countless friends and acquaintances around the world that he touched in someway. World owes him a huge debt of gratitude for how radically better he made it and without a doubt we are more inspired at Southwest than ever to keep our company strong and keep it growing and to make Herb proud. So everybody look out. Despite the 2018 challenges we set a number of financial records, I will just underscore the cash, record cash flow, Tammy, I think we had record cash on hand to end the year, record low balance sheet leverage and all that despite almost 7% higher jet fuel prices. And Tammy and Tom and Mike are going to give you all a thorough recap of 2018, so I won't go on any further other than to repeat it was a strong year and a superb finish. I want to talk about 2019; I'll talk about the government shutdown in a minute. We have a stellar year planned as I told you all in October; our revenue outlook remains superb for the year. We're off to a great start in January, have industry leading forecast, I think first quarter on solid capacity growth and barring anything unforeseen we project unit revenue growth for the year in excess of 3% just like we said back in October. Got strong traffic, strong yields supported by significantly enhanced revenue management capabilities that were rolled out during 2018. We've got new revenue enhancements committed and under construction as we previously promised and expected to come on line in 2020. Stay tuned for more details later on this year. And no, I am not talking about charging for bags. Based on our current fuel prices, our unit cost outlook for the year is also quite good. It's under 2%. We have a terrific 70% fuel hedge built for 2019 at a reasonable cost with zero put exposure and dramatic protection say $100 a barrel, we'll have protection below that as well. But it is very dramatic at that level. Our cost outlook ex-fuel and items for the year is in the 3% to 3.5% range. If we miss that range, it will be because we're below it. And the only caveat and the unforeseen category here is that we do need to hear our capacity target because the denominator is important when it comes to unit costs. As we said in the release, CASM x is front half loaded for a couple of reasons, Tammy will go over those. The second half is flattish and that bodes well as we get into 2020 and really a good cop to what was a stellar cost performance in 2018. I'll call my good friend Herb Kelleher on the first half next year in terms of cost, which is it's an aberration -- it's an anomaly bordering on an aberration. So regarding our warning back in October about cost it's obviously uncharacteristic for us. Our early indications were simply coming in much higher than we had been previously expecting. We shared that and thanks to our leaders for doing a great job and arriving at a sensible budget for 2019 and committing to a series of initiatives that will drive further efficiencies. Of course, Southwest is famous for being a low cost efficient airline over a long period of time we've been able to control our cost x fuel to 1% to 2% unit growth per annum and that's largely been driven by wage and benefits inflation that everyone here is familiar with. I don't expect that to change going forward except to say that it is our goal to control inflation to less than 1% to 2% per annum. It's important for a number of reasons that we strive for that but in any event the suggestions by some that our costs are not -- they're out of control or absolutely false. We've made controlling our costs our number one priority for 2019 and also for the next several years. But I do want to add quickly that we'll also expect to improve our operational performance and our customer service delivery. So we don't -- we don't want to move backwards with those categories. Over the past 15 years, we've seen a remarkable improvement in our revenue generating capabilities along with a dramatic improvement in our fuel consumption efficiency. Over the last five years, we've seen the best returns on invested capital in our history and it's obviously validates that our investments have more than paid off. So bottom-line 2019 is shaped up as a phenomenal year. So as for of the government shutdown, I'll sum it up in a word is maddening. And I will also state the obvious here which is that no one can predict what impact it will have if it continues. So all of the bullish comments that I just shared assume that current trends continue or we at least or we abate some of the penalties that we're already incurring. But, everyone needs to be on notice and on guard that this shutdown could harm the economy and it could harm air travel. What I can tell you is that we will do everything that we can to find a way to work through this slop and contain the damage and keep our finances strong. So with that quick overview, let me turn it over to Mr. Tom Nealon. Tom Nealon : Okay. Very good. Thank you, Gary. Thank you everyone for joining us. Well, I'm going to tell you we had used urban gear, we had a very, very strong fourth quarter, you will hear from Tammy in just a few moments. Our cost performance was very strong. We beat our guidance and our revenue performance was also very strong and we came in at the very upper end of our guidance and I do have to say that the entire Southwest family and by the way we are a family. It is a family. You all made it happen. I'm very thankful for each one of you and I appreciate all the hard work that you put in every day. So we are in fact seeing fourth quarter yield momentum continue into the first quarter and we also continue to see solid passenger demand throughout the booking curve. I think that barring any major changes in the macro environment or a protracted continuation of the government shutdowns gearing over to do, we are set up very well for a strong first quarter and first half RASM performance. As I said in the October call, Q4 was a clean quarter in terms of year-over-year comps. We had record operating revenues of $5.7 billion which is up 8.5% year-over-year and this was driven by strong performances in both passenger revenues and other revenues. Our load factor was down 0.5 half year-over-year, which was pretty much right in our expectations, while our passenger yields increased 3.7% for the quarter and we saw stable trends across the booking curve including close in, corporate business strength as well as strength in solid holiday performance. Our average one way fares were up 6.3% for the quarter and our performance was consistent across all of our regions and our yield strength produced a healthy fourth quarter RASM that was up 1.8% year-over-year, which again was near the upper end of our guidance range of plus 1% and 2%. And this is consistent with the original guidance we gave in October and reaffirmed again in December. I think it's also worth noting that keep in mind this RASM performance was a 6.5% increase in capacity and we also overlapped a plus 2% comp in 2017. So I think that's pretty strong performance. Our scheduled operating day was down 2% year-over-year in Q4 as we continued eliminating very early and very late shoulder flying which by the way is also consistent what we discussed on our prior calls is reducing our shoulder flying. Our new res system capabilities contributed roughly $95 million EBIT benefit in the quarter, which was above the higher end of our guidance range of $80 million to $90 million and this contributed in a nice way to our yield performance for the quarter. So that puts the res system benefits in $205 million of EBIT for 2018, which is a bit ahead of our plan. And we are very pleased with the performance and capabilities of the new system, we're pleased with how our revenue analysts have adopted it and really embraced it and we'll continue to enhance this and leverage it fully going forward as well. As we mentioned in our earnings release, we will be ending service to Mexico City later in the quarter, but I have to say that overall we are really pleased with our international business. Although our near international markets are small percent about 4% of our capacity, they were in fact decretive to our Q4 RASM results. Our international RASM outpaced domestic RASM and that was an almost 8% increase in capacity and these markets are continuing to develop very nicely very much in sync with our plan. The international load factors by the way were also up year-over-year and we saw pretty nice improvement in the performance of the Mexico beach destinations in the quarter. Having said all that, we don't have any plans to add any additional international this year mainly due to the fact that Hawaii is our top new market, but the RASM performance of our international markets is very strong and we're very pleased. Our boarding ancillary products also performed well both were up double digits year-over-year and as you might recall in late Q3, we introduced variable pricing for our early bird product. And this is performing right in line if not slightly ahead of our expectations. Business partner revenues were again strong in Q4 and our Rapid Rewards Program continues to be a strong performer as our co-branded credit card revenue again grew double digits year-over-year in the quarter. And we saw real strength across all metrics of the Rapid Rewards Program and this by the way is an already strong base. So we're seeing strong acquisitions in new ramp Rapid Award numbers, new credit card acquisitions that outpaced passenger growth. You're also seeing strong spending on the card and very high retention rates. So this is a very healthy program. So our industry leading program Rapid Awards continues to perform extremely well. And there is still a lot of runway in front of us for continued growth. So let me now shift to the first quarter. So based on our current bookings and yield trends we do expect Q1 RASM to increase as you've already heard in the range of 4% to 5% year-over-year. We are seeing a step up in our year-over-year RASM trend and this is largely due to strengthen our base business trends including strength in close-in bookings, strength in corporate travel. As I said just a moment ago strong performance from Rapid Awards. But in addition to these factors there are several of the things, I do just want to mention real quickly. First on the holiday calendar fronts, we will be shifting as you know Easter from Q1 to Q2. This is about a $40 million revenue shift, but it is a shift. Second, keep in mind that we didn't have any benefit in Q1 last year of our new reservation system. As you recall, this didn't begin to roll out until Q2 last year. The bottom line is, we are expecting a year-over-year RASM benefit in the first quarter about a 0.5 that's pretty solid. Third, we had a 1.5 RASM headwind last year in the first quarter and this was really driven by several things. First, the suboptimal flight schedule, which we are interested in being done talking about. The competitive fair environment and the spring break calendar shift. So none of those things repeat this year and we see those the 1.5 point tailwind in Q1 of this year. As you know, we also implement today a system wide fare increase in late November which we expect to be a benefit throughout 2019. So I do want to keep in mind our schedule is now optimized. Our fleet is at full strength and growing. We now have strong revenue management capabilities that we did not have before and we are better prepared to compete in any environment than we were a year ago. And finally, just like everyone, we are keeping a very close eye on the impact of the government shutdown and we currently estimate $10 million to $50 million negative impact January revenues thus far and that is built into our Q1 RASM guidance. I do think it's important to keep in mind though that a relatively small piece of our business travel is tied to government contracts. So our exposure is relatively low compared to others perhaps but still meaningful and we're keeping a very close eye on this. I do want to turn to the second quarter for just a moment. We are expecting a healthy year-over-year RASM performance here as well and as based on the current trends as well as on the prior year headwinds that we experienced. As a reminder, we had a 3 point RASM headwind in Q2 last year and two things really drove this. First was that suboptimal schedule again. That was a point. And second, we had a 2 point impact following Flight 1380. Both of those issues are behind us and we see this as a 3 point RASM tailwind for Q2 and we should also see a year-over-year RASM benefit in the second quarter from our res system enhancements. So to wrap it up. We are very pleased with the revenue trends we're seeing as we start 2019. And our goal is very clear, we will grow RASM this year in excess of 3%. Now, we are off to a great start here in the first quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van de Ven. Michael? Mike Van de Ven : Thanks, Tom. We finished the year with a 79.2% DoT on time performance and that was lower than what we had planned for, but still it was a 1 point, 2 point improvement over 2017. But more importantly, our performance relative to the industry really showed improvement over the last half of the year. We were sixth and seventh in the industry with respect to our on time performance in the first and second quarters. But we improved into fourth place there in the third and fourth quarters. And you know if you exclude Hawaiian out of there of course we'd have been third. The majority of that improvement was the addition of a tool that allows for that our own time performance to be an optimization criteria and the scheduled design. And that added about 1 point of OTP lift in the second half of the year and we did that without having any significant additional operational investments in our block and turn times. And in fact, if you would look at Southwest on a gauge adjusted basis, we have less block and turn time invested in an on-time performance point than anyone else in the industry. So being near the top of the industry in terms of performance, while maintaining really good asset productivity, it's a very cost effective way for us to fund our reliability targets. Turning to bag handling for a second. We put over 123 million bags on airplanes 2018. And we delivered 97.1% of them on the flight, as they were tagged. Last year that number rounded to 97.2%. So very consistent bag handling performance in '17 and '18, and those are the best two year performances in our history. We're doing all of that with pencil and paper as our primary tracking and processing tools. So in 2019, we're investing in scanning and subsequent automation that will be the building blocks for not only improved bag handling, but also improve the efficiency of our flight course procedures. And that again is going to give us an on time performance without any additional block return time investments. We continue to focus on hospitality efforts in 2018 and we've pushed the last supplemental customer information to our stations so that they can go out and identify customers that we want to recognize or perhaps apologize for the previous bad experience. We've hosted several hospitality summits for our people throughout the year. And those things are certainly making a difference because our complaints to the DoT are down 25% from where they were last year and we have the lowest complaint ratio in the industry last year. Turning to ETOPS just for a second, a primary operational focus in the near term is getting that ETOPS authorization. Although we have left a tabletop and validation flies that demonstrate our ability to execute our long range navigation and our extensive operational procedures. But until the government shutdown ends, we are at a total standstill. Now you may have heard that there have been additional FAA personnel authorized to return to work, but the work that they can do is limited to safety specific activity and certification of new or expanded operational capabilities, it doesn't fall within that definition and thus the fans bill. If the shutdown ends within a week, I think we have a reasonable chance of beginning the service in the first quarter of 2019. Otherwise, it will likely be in the second quarter. And turning to 2019 a little bit further. We do have several other initiatives and technology efforts focused on enabling productivity enhancements. We plan to implement a new maintenance system either late in 2019 or possibly early in 2020. And it's going to provide substantial opportunities to streamline our processes and eliminate some inefficient overhead costs we have associated with our current system. We're planning to make investments in our crewing systems better connectivity with our crews along with some improved Decision Support Technologies to recover from our regular operations. And we also have more opportunities to continue to incorporate some of more advanced predictive analytics in the NOC and to use that while we're running our daily operations. So just to close out, I think our operations are on very solid footing as we move into 2019. The operational metrics are right where they need to be. And that gives us more time to focus on the cost opportunities that Gary and Tom have mentioned. And with that brief update, I will turn it over to Tammy Romo. Tammy Romo : Right. Thank you, Mike, and hello everyone. I'm also very pleased with how our people closed out the year strong and fourth quarter. Our 2018 performance truly was the second half story. Our people saw your spirit was on full display as they overcame great challenges last year to produce the outstanding results we reported this morning and we have great momentum coming into this year. On top of the record fourth quarter revenue performance Tom took you through, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year cost performance despite higher year-over-year fuel prices. We did see some relief in crude prices in the back half of December, which resulted in our fourth quarter hedged fuel price of $2.25 per gallon coming in at the lower end of our mid-December guidance range. However, our market prices in December also provided an opportunity for us to add to our first half 2019 fuel hedge position as well as 2020 with the Brent crude spot price trading in the lowest $50 per barrel range. We are now 70% hedged for this year with 75% to 85% protection in first half 2019 and a roughly 60% hedged in the second half of the year. For 2020, we are now roughly 50% hedged. Our hedging premium for this year are approximately 95 million or about $0.04 per gallon compared with 2018's premium expense of 135 million or $0.06 a gallon. Our 2019 hedging protection produces modest gains at current market prices and kicks in more materially at $70 Brent crude equivalent. Now we're well prepared should we continue to see volatility in prices. And as we've previously mentioned our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in a market price decline. For first quarter 2019 based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging position, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2 to $2.05 range with an estimated $0.02 hedging gain offset by $0.06 of premium costs. And for full year 2019, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2 to $2.10 range with an estimated $0.01 hedging gain offset by $0.04 cents of premium costs. Fuel efficiency improved 1.5% in 2018 and we expect a similar improvement year-over-year in the first quarter and for the full year 2019 in the 1% to 2% range, which is around $60 million in annual fuel savings. This will continue to be a key part of our cost story going forward, which should become more meaningful as we begin retiring Dash 700s this year and continue taking on more fuel efficient MAX aircraft. Excluding fuel special items and profit sharing, our fourth quarter unit costs were down slightly compared to last year and slightly better than our expectation of flat to up 1%. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2018 unit costs benefited from a year-over-year tailwind of about 3 point due to fourth quarter 2017's employee tax reform bonus. For full year 2018, our CASM excluding fuel special items and profit sharing ended right in line with our expectations of flat to up 1% year-over-year. Our unwavering focus on controlling costs played a significant role in managing cost inflation throughout the year and I'd like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous effort. And I'd also like to thank our team for all the hard work they put into completing our 2019 plan. We currently expect our full year 2019 CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase in the 3% to 3.5% range year-over-year with the pressure weighted to the first half of this year. For first quarter 2019, we're expecting our unit costs excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase around 6% year-over-year and our second quarter 2019, year-over-year CASM x trend is expected to be similar to first quarter. For the second half of this year, current cost trends and expectations suggest flat year-over-year unit costs excluding fuel and profit sharing. Our quarterly capacity growth is playing a big part in our first half cost pressure and as you all know, the timing of our Hawaii flying has been delayed and is in flux. And we're incurring Hawaii specific startup costs without the benefit of the flying, which alone is about a 0.5 point penalty in our first half CASM x year-over-year trends. In addition, we expect first half unit cost pressure from the under-utilization of our fleet due to the timing of Hawaii. This cost pressure should ease as we ramp up our Hawaii flying in the second half of this year. And this was all contemplated in our full year capacity growth guidance no more than 5%. With respect to our first quarter CASM x year-over-year inflation as we mentioned in this morning's press release, the largest drivers of our 6% year-over-year CASM growth are the underutilization of our fleet due in the first half of the year due to the delay and a lifeline, in addition to higher airport costs and depreciation and the timing of maintenance and technology spend. As we said on our last call, controlling our costs is a top priority. And as we always have we'll continue our rigorous efforts to contain costs and protect our competitive advantage. Our long-term goal is to contain annual year-over-year growth and our unit costs excluding fuel and profit sharing to below 2% which I believe is reasonable and achievable. And finally, as a wrap up of our cost discussions, the primary reason on our tax rate for fourth quarter came in closer to 20% is the realization of year end tax credits. We continue to estimate our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. And on that note, the lower tax rate certainly was a welcome contributor to our record operating and free cash flow performance in 2013. We ended the year with ample cash and short-term investments of 3.7 billion with our 1 billion revolver fully available. Our balance sheet remains strong and we have very manageable debt obligations and capital spending plans for 2019. In 2018, we invested approximately 1.9 billion into the business, which ended lower than our guidance of 2 billion mostly due to timing. In 2019, we continue to expect a similar level of CapEx spending and the 1.9 billion to 2 billion range as we invest in the future of our airline. We are investing in technology including a new maintenance system which is as significant to the operations side of our business as our new reservation system is the commercial side. And we have airport investments underway particularly at LAX and St. Louis. And we're building a new maintenance hangar in Baltimore. And of course, we have 44 aircraft deliveries this year including 28 new aircraft from Boeing, which I'll cover shortly. We expect our investments to help drive incremental revenue opportunity as well as support longer term cost objectives as we roll out better tools for employees and more efficient processes and technologies to drive productivity as well as support our long-term growth plans. Our 2018 free cash flow was a record 3.1 billion and we returned 2.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. For 2019, we plan to continue our balanced approach to investing in the business and in our employees and with the opportunities to continue providing free cash flow to our shareholders. Before I close, I'll quickly take you through our fleeting capacity plans. We ended 2018 with 750 aircrafts in our fleet in line with our target and for 2019, we currently have a total of 44 aircraft deliveries which is comprised of seven owned MAX 7, 21-owned MAX 8 and 16 leased MAX 8. This is 10 more than our previous order book disclosure as we had one December MAX 8 delivery that split into 2019 and we also had 9 additional leased MAX 8 aircraft. These additional 9 leased aircraft are earmarked for this year's fleet replacement needs. As we mentioned, we'll start retiring some of our oldest Dash 700s this year as we continue with our fleet modernization effort, which will help improve our fuel efficiency, operational reliability and maintenance burden. Our current plan is to retire around 20 of our Dash 700 this year resulting in about 25 net aircraft additions for 2019 and a year end 2019 fleet of approximately 775 aircraft. We expect first quarter 2019 capacity to increase in the 3.5% to 4% range year-over-year and for a full year 2019, we continue to expect our available seat miles to increase no more than 5% year-over-year. Our schedule is currently published through early August and this schedule excludes expected Hawaii flying which as we've covered will be added as soon as we can. Here in a week or so, we'll publish our schedule through the end of September. Excluding Hawaii, our first half 2019 capacity growth is 2.5%. And as a reminder, Hawaii is expected to represent up to half of planned 2019 capacity growth and we're certainly looking forward to providing more capacity to detail once we're able to upload our Hawaii schedules. In the meantime with our ETOPS process on hold, we have some uncertainty in our capacity plan for this year. So we will take it one schedule at a time for now. So in closing, despite our challenges in 2018, our employees rose to the occasion time and time again and I thought our execution was very strong. As a quick recap on what we shared today as Tom mentioned, we are starting 2019 with a very healthy RASM outlook. We remain committed to our low fare brand and our revenue management capabilities are as strong as ever. We have been very focused on closing out our 20 19 plan over the past few months. And despite some cost inflation above where we'd like to be this year, I feel really good about our 2019 cost plan and our path to arrest this trajectory going forward. In particular, the much improved cost outlook for second half of 2019. First and foremost, we want to expand our margins in 2019 and we want to improve our returns on capital. While fuel prices are currently down year-over-year, our improved fuel hedging position for 2019 and 2020 provides even more near-term protection, if oil prices go back up. We continue to invest in the business and our fleet, facilities and technologies and many of our investments this year will support future growth and scalability of Southwest Airlines as we continue our march to become the world's most loved, most flown and most profitable airline. In closing, I want to personally thank those of you who reached out to Herb -- to reach out to us to share your personal stories and heartfelt thoughts about Herb to our Southwest family. He really did change the airline industry for the best and now he will be missed greatly. His legacy will live on forever. And with that Greg, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions. Operator : Thank you very much ma'am. [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin our first question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Hey. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for the time. Gary, I think there was some urgency from you last quarter regarding the cost pressure you were seeing and the need to find more revenue to offset that. I think you mentioned that you were open to alternatives. I mean has that mindset changed because you're now more comfortable with 19 CASM x and then 2020 returning to more normal levels. Can you just maybe update your perspective there? Thank you. Gary Kelly : Yes. Sure, Joe. To be honest with you, I don't remember exactly the words that I used, but I wouldn't say that anything has changed other than time has gone by. We've firmed up our plan. We've more than sustained our momentum. It's actually improved. And we've told you the truth in October. We're telling you the truth today. We're very excited about 2019. I think what I must admit was just the desire that we have to keep the pipeline full of new ideas and new initiatives. And in terms of what we have in flight right now, I think we're all very pleased, very encouraged with the changes that we made during 2018. We've got plenty of experience under our belt there. And again, my hat's off to our commercial team, I think they did a phenomenal job and so we feel really good about that and even better about our forecast for 2019 and the benefits that would flow from that. Beyond that, I think I was clear in October that we weren't contemplating then nor are we contemplating now any new initiatives per se on the revenue front for 2019. All I was doing today is just to reiterate that that as far as 2020 goes and what I first mentioned in July that work is more than an idea. It's a commitment. The construction is underway. Every time that we have relooked at the couple of ideas that we have under construction they look better to us. So I don't think there's anything different in the message today other than we have better visibility more certainty and we're down the road with some of our work. It's been firmed up. We've got a project plan people working on it and we're feeling very good about 2019 and encouraged about our opportunity to continue to augment that momentum in 2020. Joseph DeNardi : That's helpful Gary. Just two very quick follow ups. I mean, so should I understand that in terms of the ancillary or the revenue initiatives in 2020 that we should just wait to hear what you're planning on doing at this point you're not ready to talk about it. And then, the second one is, you mentioned the fare increase in November as a driver of PRASM. Can you just quantify that somehow, so we can understand how impactful things like that are for your RASM like what it's adding to the first quarter or beyond that? Thank you. Gary Kelly : I will let Tammy address the latter question on the first part of your question. Yes. It's very straightforward. All we want people to know is that we're not sitting by and assuming that revenues will come to us that we're continually looking for new ideas for -- it's a little early for competitive reasons to share exactly what we want to do. And so, yes, you're going have to stay tuned on that for sometime later in the year when it's more ready for primetime. That will give us a better opportunity to forecast better what we think the benefits will be. Tammy, you want to talk about the fare increase component? Tammy Romo : Sure. I'd be happy to do that. And as you all know when you're assuming -- like you're assuming for revenue obviously depends on your assumptions in terms of the impact to traffic, but it kind of all else equal and assuming no dilution in traffic, it could be up to say call it 1%, but then all that's been baked into the guidance that we provide you this morning. Joseph DeNardi : That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And moving on, from Barclays we have Brandon Oglenski. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Gary or Tom. I mean the revenue outlook here especially in the first half sounds pretty strong. I guess can you talk strategically as JetBlue rolls out their version of basic economy and the majority of the industry goes to this ancillary based pricing structure. Is that strategically what's driving you guys to change some of these initiatives that we have to wait to hear about in 2020? And is it making it more difficult on the forward end of the booking curve to effectively generate the same RASM as your competitors? Gary Kelly : Great question. Well, Tom, will take this one and you are going to do two. I think short answer is, no. That's not what we are responding to. What we're -- our capabilities evolve over time. Hopefully that means they improve and we see opportunities where we can drive business in greater volumes or more efficiently in terms of the pricing. And that's what we're going after here in the near-term. And I was asked -- I'm asked all the time about basic economy. You're not going to see basic economy from Southwest. That's not what we do. And I already said, we're not going to charge for bag fees. We have we think better opportunities that fit our brand. I love the fact that we're different and they unbundle and we don't. And so we just need to continue to find ways with the universe of travelers and the varying needs that they have to see how we can stay true to our brand and offer something of more value to road warriors to once a year flyers whatever it might be. And I'd say, we have a long list of ideas. And right now, we're going to focus on a couple and they're going to come to market in 2020. Tom? Tom Nealon : Well, I think all that I'll add to that Gary is, if you think about over time there are some things that we would probably have done sooner, if we were able our prior reservation system, the old SaaS cowboy system just precluded us from doing things that we would have liked to done years ago. Now that we have the foundation of the one res system in, it really does set the foundation for us to do some things that honestly when we talk with you later in the year you're going to think, yes, that makes perfect sense. I would expect you'd done that earlier. Well, we would have, if we could have. Now we can so we will. So that's the kind of thing you're going to hear us when we are talking about. But, in our ancillary business, if you look at our other our early bird products and things like that these are not inconsequential and they're -- by thinking those are the variable pricing that kind of thing we really do continue to drive strong ancillary performance. So I'm really proud of the product and probably we are and there's capability that we have that we can build upon. So I guess I'll stop, stay tuned for Investor Day then you will talk about some point, right? But that's what it is. Gary Kelly : And is very quickly on your point about staying competitive, just look at the results. I mean there is no evidence that we are not competitive. In fact there's evidence that we have the best combination of revenues and cost and returns period. So I think we're all very confident about where we stand in our brand and we'll put it up against anybody. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate the response no doubt Gary, your returns margins are pretty much leading. But I guess, are we to think then that on the forward booking curve where you are facing competition from the ULCC models, you guys are able to get away with a higher fare structure? Is that true or? Gary Kelly : Well, our ULCC overlap is gigantic. So I think the results would say, yes. And I'm just pointing back to earlier comments that I made about our enhanced revenue management capabilities. So we're in a better position than ever to compete with low cost, high cost, you name it. And Tom is or has hinted that we were going to use we're leveraging this technology to pursue a couple of new revenue generating ideas. So we got a lot of -- we have a lot of strengths. We have more seats in the United States than anybody else. We have more customers than anybody else. We have the best frequent flyer program. We have a great overall product in terms of the reliability in the on-time performance in the baggage handling. We have the best employees in terms of the hospitality. It is a dynamite package. Nobody can approach matching that combination of strengths. Certainly the ULCCs can't come close to that. And again, as I say we're real confident about where we are. We never want a standstill and we want to keep investing and making improvements. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the time. I want to ask you a little bit about the decision to kind of postpone any international growth this year, if you kind of look back the last couple of years opening up international was kind of a growth avenue for you. And I wanted to get a sense for whether this is just a decision to kind of prioritize the organization's focus on Hawaii or whether maybe the opportunities for where you could get to in international markets or maybe getting more developed quicker than you thought? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you're feeling about the potential still in international given that you're taking a pause this year. Gary Kelly : No. It's the former and we've been clear about that. So we're going to be growing, I think most people think pretty aggressively this year. We've added a lot of airplanes to overcome the retirement of the classic fleet, and then, grow beyond that. So we're at record fleet numbers this year and we'll be adding a net of 25-ish in 2019. So to answer your question, is what do we do with 25 airplanes? And we're going to Hawaii. We're going big that needs to be the focus. And it kind of crowds out expansion in other areas like international. Tom gave a quick summary of the international performance as we saw it here in the fourth quarter. And taking a little breather there right now is allowing a really good unit revenue development. So that's all fine. But we have vast opportunities to grow internationally. And were it not for Hawaii, we would absolutely be adding some more international routes and augmenting some of our flying. So it's simply a matter of prioritization and Hawaii, I think deserves that kind of prioritization is that big of an opportunity. David Vernon : And then, new opportunities to maybe repurpose some of the -- some equipment from underperforming domestic routes into maybe International. That would be a little bit more attractive. Like how do you guys think about making that balance [indiscernible] there? Gary Kelly : Well, that's just you do that every day. So, yes, we're pruning. And in fact that will be part of our cost initiatives that we talked about back in October is evolving our route strategy so that not only is it more commercially viable, but it also is more customer friendly in terms of recovery if we have late flights. And that should help our cost performance. So we are always doing those kinds of things. We have a very complicated network. There are infinite solutions as to how we route our aircraft and that is one of the inputs. But, yes, the answer is absolutely obviously we're always doing that and we like where we are with the route system as it is right now. But we'll continue to prune it as we go forward. David Vernon : All right. Thank you. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up on the LaGuardia and Reagan. Can you give us a sense for when the timing of those [indiscernible] from Alaska is going to kick in and whether or not that capacity that would be going into those gates is in the -- ASN got already? Gary Kelly : You're testing my memory, but I believe it's in the fall, in the November time period of 2018. It's already going in. David Vernon : So those gates are already being utilized. Gary Kelly : Those flights are in place and performing well. We've also moved LaGuardia is undergoing this massive makeover and we've moved to our new facilities so that's been very serendipitous for us to get really good real estate at the same time that we're adding flights. So all that's going really well also. David Vernon : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Moving on, from JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker. Jamie Baker : Hey, good afternoon everybody. First question on Hawaii and Tammy, sort of touched on and saying that Hawaii could constitute half of this year's growth. But, I'm curious with the ETOPS delay relative to your initial expectations, is that possibly sort of working to your advantage and so far as the non ETOPS related preparations are obviously still taking place in the background, so does that imply that when you do finally start service you can ramp up more quickly than plan. In other words, if the cadence was originally to add and I'm making this up, I don't know, three nonstop routes per quarter. So you'd be doing 12 after a year. If you don't start flying until the second quarter, could you still get to the year end plan in less time because of the delay that you're currently taking or does it not work that way. Gary Kelly : Well, that was probably a better question for Mike. So Jamie are you coming at it more from an operational build up as opposed to a commercial ramp up. Jamie Baker : Well, both, presumably had you started service in the fourth quarter of last year, if you were flying it now, you'd have a plan in place for the fourth quarter of this year. As the date slips, does the fourth quarter plan come down or can you ramp more quickly because you're basically just twiddling their thumbs at this point n offense waiting for the government to get its act together. Mike Van de Ven : So Jamie, this is Mike. In terms of Hawaii, when you think about all the other non-ETOPS things our staff is ready, our procedures are ready, our gates are ready, our equipment is ready. We're ready to go with that. The only taking item we have with ramp up is making sure that as we ramp up, we have an adequate number of pilots trained for ETOPS flight. And so, I would tell you that the slow to ramp up over the first three to six months is probably what it is. And then after that we have as many -- we don't have any constraints really after that. Gary Kelly : And just philosophically, Jamie, we're going to be conservative. So this is -- there is a certification process for a reason and I think what I just underscore what Mike just said. We're going to want to go at a pace that we're comfortable with. And I don't think we will be at the same place at the end of the year that we would have been Mike had we started that's February 1, in terms of flying. But at the same time in the grand scheme of things, we're going to get there and is not talking about years delay and we are commercial folks have other purposes for -- relative to the earlier question. There are plenty of places that we can put airplanes and that is one advantage we have as an airline. We can move the airplanes around and our people are very resilient and they're willing to do temporary duty in other locations. So it's sloppy and we've admitted that and it's reflected in our first half numbers. Even with that, we're still looking at a really a stellar year and other than that nothing is changed. The nice thing is, the FAA has approved our program. It is ready to go. All we have to do now is demonstrate to them that we can execute our program. And so that the line of sight to getting to the certification is pretty darn sharp and the FAA is really anxious to get their part of this work done too. It's just a shame that we are where we are with the shutdown. Jamie Baker : Sure, sure. That's very helpful color and it wasn't -- I didn't mean to insinuate that it was -- that Southwest was to blame for the delay here. And second, as I'm sure you're aware competitive growth in secondary cities is running quite a bit ahead of what's taking place in the major markets. Obviously, United is driving some of that constraint with the hubs also a contributing factor. But anytime I think secondary cities, I obviously thanks Southwest. So is it safe to assume that in terms of year-on-year RASM, your larger markets are outperforming the secondary cities or would that be a stretch? Gary Kelly : Well, I -- you know us so well, so I don't know that I'm trying to debate the point, but I don't think of Southwest as a secondary city airline, 100% of our customers flow through our top -- I don't know 10 airports. So we're a big city airline. And in other words, we don't, just using your words, secondary, we don't go non-stop secondary to secondary. We know in recent years as an example, we've added non-stops from San Antonio, let's say to Kansas City, we're the number one airline in each city. I would certainly not refer to them as secondary. They're very substantial cities. We've got a lot of fans in both and those are very successful flights. So I don't know as I remember we've got 85 -- 48 states cities and they're in the top 85. And in fact, we try to avoid the smaller cities because we fly as you well know, we fly 737s and we just don't generate enough volume compared to what we could do in other locales. So I think the net answer is, we're used to competition. I mean that's not going to go away. That will continue to make us better. And we're just continuing to play to our strengths and continue to expand strategically in a way that plays to our strengths. Jamie Baker : Strong answers to both questions. Thanks gentlemen. Operator : And moving on, from Morgan Stanley we have Rajeev Lalwani. Rajeev Lalwani : Good afternoon, Gary. Hi. Gary Kelly : Hi. Rajeev Lalwani : Gary a couple of questions for you on the CASM side. First, can you just walk us through the steps you took and the mitigants you pursued to kind of bring costs down to 3%, 3.5%? What sort of labor impact you have on those numbers? And then, secondly, it seems like in the back half of the year, you're going to be kind of flattish on unit costs. Why isn't that a good run rate to use going forward, is it, labor that can disrupt out a bit and maybe get you closer to 2% sort of that longer term targets, give us some thoughts there on sort of this year and then longer term? Gary Kelly : Well, Tammy, I might let you, Mike and Tom kind of talk about how we got from there to here. It's just I don't know there was anything real fancy. What was a little fancier was putting together cost initiatives that all of our leadership agreed and committed to which is a little bit more of a longer project. But going through the annual budget is a grind. And as I admitted in my comments earlier, it was coming in much higher than what I was expecting. And we fessed up and told you all that. And I think our folks have done a nice job in trimming that back. But your point about 2020 is a good one. And I will admit to you that's exactly where my mind will start in terms of the expectations for 2020 is something that's flat on a run rate basis. But it's -- but I will also admit to you that it's a little too early to tell. And until we -- the devil can be in the details and we definitely want to have more confidence that that is in fact to run rate before we just put these bold statements out there. But we're 1% to 2% inflation over a long period of time. And this is a very efficient company to begin with and we have invested significantly in driving more revenue and driving more fuel efficiency. So I'm proud of that. And that's what you should expect from us going forward is on an annualized basis over a long period of time no more than 1% to 2%, our goal as I said is to now bring that lower. Our aspirational goal among our leadership is to keep unit cost flat. And so I can assure you with the cost initiatives that are underway that will be the expectation of the goal going into 2020. But it's far too early to tell you that that is our forecast for the year. But, Tammy, you want to color a little bit, how we got from there to here? Tammy Romo : Sure. And I'd be happy to do that. And I do want to remind everybody on the last call, we were early in our planning which there is normally a lot of scrubbing that we do when we get the original submissions on our annual plan. What now clearly the inflation and the reason we talked about that was because it was more than certainly what we were expecting and obviously what we had indicated to you all. So I think the important point and takeaway today is that the guidance that we've shared with you, obviously, it was higher than 3.5% when we started the journey and through a combination of scrubbing our costs and changes we have made some tweaks to our schedule in the second half. And we have continued to fleet modernization, which we've also fine tune our plans there. We landed on the range that we provided here to you today. So as I mentioned earlier, we picked up some more airplanes and so that's we certainly expect to see some improvement from the fleet modernization effort. So really right now we're focused on execution this year and obviously already working on improvements beyond 2019. So, and again, I'll just remind you that we're back on a better CASM x trajectory in the second half of this year, which is around flat year-over-year. So we'll continue making tweaks to our schedule to balance our operation efficiency with our commercial opportunity. So I think that's the more significant opportunity here in the second half of the year. And as Mike mentioned and I covered a little bit, we're currently investing in operational technology projects and those should provide better tools to help us improve staffing efficiency and just allow our employees to eliminate pain points from their daily processes. So as we look ahead just -- those are some of the types of initiatives that we have time in our bag of tricks here. And as we work to just ensure that we hit the trajectory that we've shared with you today. So that's really probably the main point I want to point out. Anyone else technically. Gary Kelly : Tammy, we want to make sure that everyone understands that -- I don't know if happy is the right word, but I am not satisfied with unit cost growth in 2015 of 3% to 3.5%. So don't get us wrong. We were taking corrective action. Right now that's what we -- that's what we're facing. And we've had plenty of years in our history where we've had 3% unit cost growth and it's just going to be one of those years, but that is certainly not what you should extrapolate going forward we expect a lot more research for this. Tom Nealon : So Tammy and Gary talked about, how we feel about 2019. We'll work to hit that plan and we hit plans. Let me talk about beyond 2019 and how we're thinking about really the 2020 and beyond kind of cost thinking. I guess I think it's really important to start with -- so where are we starting from? And we are one of the most efficient airlines in the world by the way. So we are very, very efficient. But, we do have opportunities and I think that you'll be at some point, I do want to take you through this, we want to take you through this. But there -- we're working on things you'd expect us to be working on. Just an example, we fly over 4000 flights a day and every day you do have your regular operations. Well, your regular operations by definition are inherently inefficient. So what can we do to drive efficiency in recovering the network, right, during a weather outage or whatever it is. So there is work going on, but just that that is an example adjusting that network very, very modestly transparent to the customer, net neutral to the revenue, the whole thing, just modest tweaks to things like that filter across the operations. So driving out inefficiency is how we're thinking about this. This is not just pruning things. This is really thinking about the broader big processes that we use drive the operation. So in 2019, we're going to drive the budget, we are going to drive the efficiency we need, 2020 and beyond are bigger themes actually. And that's how we're thinking about it. Gary Kelly : And just one other thing very quickly just to remind everybody what's driving the 3%, 3.5%. It's a couple of basic things, significant airport projects and investments around the country. Number two, a heavier aircraft maintenance burden that is manifesting in 2019. Number three, we are seeing a step-up in depreciation from deployment of more aircraft and also the deployment of technology projects. So one of the things that we did for 2019 is, we said let's just make sure that we are taking into account the benefits that should flow through our cost structure of a lot of these investments that are being deployed. And that was a lot of the improvement that we saw since October. I guess in the interest of time we ought to move on to our next question. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take that last question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Thanks for getting me on. I was wondering if you might be surprised to compare your outlook for some of these Hawaii markets with BWI Oakland, which is kind of a high load factor low yield market. But the point of sale makes it obviously is going to be very different. I was wondering if you might think in time if given these factors, the RASM performance in Hawaii can be in line or better than how you do in that market? Thank you. Gary Kelly : That is a great question. And I'm going to sidestep it a little bit under because I don't like to talk about individual specific markets and their profitability. We just always had a tradition of maintaining our thoughts sort of in a proprietary way about that setting the comparison aside for a second. All of the forecast that we have done from a very significant point of strength in California to Hawaii have been exceptional. So I'm expecting that they will perform like a typical startup initially and develop quickly and be very, very satisfactory performers, point number one. What we were I think pleasantly surprised with is when we were urged to contemplate inter island flying which when we first revealed in October of 2017 that we were going to Hawaii, we were not thinking that. Once we looked at that, we were pleasantly surprised how it forecast as well. And so I think on both aspects of that business the mainland to the islands, and then, the inter island both forecast well. And based on our experience with forecasting and understanding our customers and our markets and the competitive dynamics we feel very, very good about the viability of that. Or else we wouldn't have made the choice and the judgment to ramp that up very quickly. We would have been much more cautious. So we're putting our money where our mouth is and in any event as you know the exposure is limited. I think Hawaii builds up to be a point Tom or something like that of our capacity. But that's sort of a backhanded way of saying we're bullish about it. I don't intend it that way. We're going to have a very viable schedule. We have a lot of customers who are huge fans of Southwest that we're confident will get on board. Hawaii is a huge destination which is you have to take that into account when you do the comps to other markets of comparable distance. And we're going to do well is the bottom line and while we continually update our forecast, our judgment about this opportunity has been unchanged. Hunter Keay : Just real quick in for you Gary. You said look out in the beginning of the call, it was interesting it jumped out at me. Who were you talking to? Gary Kelly : Whoever is listening. It's been an emotional experience for our company to lose someone like Herb. And I can't remember whether you ever had the opportunity to meet him, but the impact he had on people is absolutely profound. And you get on a Southwest Airlines airplane and everybody feels like they know him. Everybody feels like they that he loves them and people are inspired. So there's just no stopping us. And it's all about our people in terms of making this airline work and they are as inspired as ever and they're the ones who win these customers, they're the ones who win the Fortune Most Admired and just on and on and on and it comes from the heart. And there is no company in the world that that is like this. So whoever wants to get in our way better look out. Hunter Keay : I got you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Ryan Martinez : I think that's a great way to wrap up there. Thank you for all the questions. That concludes our analyst call and of course if you have any additional questions please give me a ring. And thank you for joining us today. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Greg and I like to welcome the members of the media to our call today. I will jump right into the Q&A portion. Greg if you don't mind just refreshing them on how they can tee up for a question. Q - Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You talked a lot about the shutdown -- the impact of the shutdown at a high level. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a sense of whether it's becoming a problem for safety, for operations whether you're seeing any kinds of delays either in the airports or in air? A - Gary Kelly : Well, thanks Alison. I'd like for Mike to have a chance to answer that too. But I think the bottom line is, no. Tammy and Ryan put in the press release the dollar impact that we've seen and that's pretty specific to government travel. And that's something that we're comfortable that we can estimate. You use the word safety. It is safe and it will be safe. I think the risk is that things slow down in order to retain a safe operating environment. That's both from an air traffic perspective as well as an airport perspective. So I am so proud of our FAA and TSA employees. I feel like they are doing a phenomenal job. They shouldn't have to endure this. And I think our whole country should offer their thanks to them for keeping the airlines running. Our business is one that is intimately tied in with federal government. The federal government touches every single customer that goes through the airport and they touch every single flight that we have and it goes beyond just those things. But so far the operation Mike has been actually superb since the beginning of the year. But what would you like to answer. A - Mike Van de Ven : I think you did all the high points, I agree with what he said no matter what it will be safe. It's just whether or not the volume of activity can keep pace with all the different staffing whether it's TSA or air traffic controllers or things like that. And so I do things that longer that it goes more risks that we have that maybe there are longer waiting times at checkpoints that had to wait -- taxiing times may lengthen, your in-flight times may change maybe a little bit longer trial between the airplanes. So those are the kinds of things that I think we ought to be about. A - Gary Kelly : And again, also to be clear, we're not saying that. In fact, Mike's operation the on-time performance is better this year than it was a year ago so far. So things so far knock on wood are going just fine. So this is all conjecture. But those are the things that we're all worried about and this thing just can't go on. I feel the FAA has made a good point about what is the impact right now. Well, they are not allowed to hire anybody if they did they wouldn't do any good because they're not allowed to train anybody. And so they already have a hard time keeping their air traffic control positions filled. And it takes years of experience to develop proficiency and this was harmful. So we know at some point down the road there'll be some harm, some way, somehow. But this is crazy. It just absolutely needs to end. And if it left as it is, it will harm the economy. It will harm air travel. I don't know -- what impacts are on other industries, but these are important jobs or they wouldn't be there. The notion that they're not essential is absurd, they're all essential. And so it just the sooner than later, but right now knock on wood everything is running remarkably well and that's a real tribute to the federal government employees. Q - Alison Sider : Are you hearing any concerns from your crew, from pilots or flight attendants, are they coming to you with any worries about sort of the robustness of the system? A - Gary Kelly : I've never heard one Mike, any Tammy, Tom, no. Never heard one. I think in fact, I would bet you and you're welcome to talk to anybody who will talk to you. I bet you will hear the same thing that you heard from me, which is that people are there and they're working hard. I think anytime I see anybody I thank them for their hard work and so should you when you travel. Q - Alison Sider : We will do. Thanks. Operator : Moving on, we have Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Q - Tracy Rucinski : Hi, there. Again on the shutdown, so far there aren't any signs of Washington reaching an agreement to reopen. Is there anything that the airline industry can do or is doing to force an end to the deadlock? A - Gary Kelly : I think the short answer is no. As you would expect, the industry aligned with many other industries has communicated to leadership in the federal government. The risk of continuing this and the harm that can be done so absent that. What else can be done. And we're going to do everything that we can to find ways to mitigate this and not simply sit here and be victims about this. But in the end this is -- we're dealing with a monopoly. So we don't have the choice to go to someone else to provide our traffic services or our security services. It's just not available to us and it shouldn't work this way, but it does. So in the meantime, we just need to have cool heads and attend to our business as best we can and we're determined here that we're going to have a very good year in 2019 no matter what. And we'll do our best to work through this slop. Q - Tracy Rucinski : Thanks. And just a minor question again about the timing of Hawaii. You said that a chunk of your first quarter unit costs were due to start up costs from Hawaii. If it's that one does end up rolling over into the second quarter. Will there be an additional unforeseen cost impact? A - Tammy Romo : Yes. This is Tammy. Yes. That continues into the second quarter there will absolutely be a continued cost impact. And obviously, it depends on the duration there. A - Gary Kelly : But that's pretty much factored into your -- A - Tammy Romo : That's all in our guidance. A - Gary Kelly : That's all in. Q - Tracy Rucinski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we will hear from FlightGlobal we have Ghim-Lay Yeo. Q - Ghim- Lay Yeo : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow up about Hawaii. I know you plan to start in Thailand flying probably shortly after you get the FAA approvals to begin a Hawaii service. How soon afterwards can you actually launched into [indiscernible] flying has that timeline shifted at all, no, that you are not exactly sure when Hawaii services actually start. A - Gary Kelly : Mike, you want to talk about that. A - Mike Van de Ven : Yes. So when we first start up to Hawaii, we're just going to be focused on the mainland to Hawaii and flying for a period of time. And then, not launch into the entire island the final publicly probably after leaving a couple of months of service before we get into the inter island flying. A - Gary Kelly : But I think what Mike had planned is, we got our approval from the FAA for our program by the end of December and that was a huge accomplishment. I was very proud of our folks and very thankful to the FAA. They worked hard to get there. All that was left during the month of January and Mike had all this scheduled, they had dates scheduled. They had the task scheduled, was to validate for the FAA that we knew our program and that we could handle different scenarios that would be posed. All that led to a schedule that assuming everything was passed if you will that we would be selling next week. And Mike had planned, once we started selling that we would be flying sometime in February. So now he is going to roll this. So if we get started, again, with the FAA let's say February 1, I think you can roughly allow a month and then we would be able to get our certificate and sell, and then we would be flying in the following month. And it just rolls. So with that that's roughly the amount of time that we're going to need from the time that we get back on task until we fly. So it's somewhere or no homie to this because it will still depend, but it's somewhere around six to eight weeks. I would say from the time that he starts working with the FAA to finish to the time that we would be flying. And then Mike has to publish schedules for his flight crews and that is on a monthly cadence so it's -- so that's it. Anyway that should give you some rough idea. I think it is possible if we get started quickly that we could be flying in March. We don't see a path to flying in February. It's too late for February but we could be flying in March. But we don't start with the FAA units, part one it's going to be April. So that's kind of a rough road. A - Mike Van de Ven : So it is just to play out through that and the launch in mainline service to one location, we will have mainline service to a second location and then as we get more Hawaii locations out there we have more options than to connect that inter island flying and that's what I will launch with the mainland service first and follow on with the other flying. Q - Ghim- Lay Yeo : Sure. And I have a separate question about the Mexican city. Are you able to see a little bit more wider than was it mostly because corporate in mind and materialize, has there been any self implements from what's been going on with the Mexican city airport situation. A - Gary Kelly : Right now. Our focus is primarily on destinations from our strong points in the U.S. The better performing destinations for us right now or the leisure destinations. Mexico City, we are showing very nice improvement. It's more much more of a business market and given where we are right now we just have better opportunities in terms of deploying that capacity. I'd love for us to be back in Mexico City one of these days. Tom and his team are working on better commercial capabilities in terms of marketing and foreign countries accepting foreign currency and all of those things are futures, which certainly support service to a place like Mexico City better than what we have today. But we just have better alternatives. And like I said hopefully we'll be back in Mexico City one of these days. Our priority right now obviously is adding Hawaii service. Q - Ghim- Lay Yeo : Sure. Thank you for your time. Operator : Next question will come from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Q - David Koenig : Hi. Gary I think I heard you say that Southwest has communicated your concern about the shutdown to government. But if I heard that if I understood that correctly, anything you can say about who you have talked to especially any of their principals in the White House or Congress? A - Gary Kelly : We have -- as a part of the Trade Association. The trade association has communicated on all of our behalves. And off the top of my head, I don't remember who was on that list but I'm sure it was a long list of officials that received that communication. Q - David Koenig : Okay. And have you gotten any feedback on what they heard. What was the response from the people that they talked to. I assume they are talking about A4A then? A - Gary Kelly : I'm talking about A4A and I don't recall any response. Q - David Koenig : Okay. A - Gary Kelly : I've seen nothing -- I've seen no response in writing, I'll put it that way. Q - David Koenig : What can you and I mean the airline industry do that you haven't done yet? A - Gary Kelly : I think all we can continue -- is to reach out to members of Congress, reach out to leadership, reach out to the White House and there are -- I can assure you there are ongoing opportunities for us to do that and we will. Q - David Koenig : All right. Thanks. Operator : We have time for one more question. We'll last here from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Q - Robert Silk : Good afternoon guys. A - Gary Kelly : Hi. Good afternoon. Q - Robert Silk : [indiscernible] one of the ones that reported the drone on approach to Newark a couple days ago. How big of an issue of a concern is it for Southwest and other airlines obviously, the FAA moved quickly on new rules relating to drones that will make it easier for airports for them to be tracked and also to detect them and potentially disable them. A - Gary Kelly : Rob, are you still there? Robert. Q - Robert Silk : Did you not hear me? A - Gary Kelly : Yes. I think so. We got you. Q - Robert Silk : I hear you all. I asked about drones, do I need to repeat the question? A - Gary Kelly : No, no. We got it. A - Mike Van de Ven : I'm not -- this is Mike. I'm not familiar with a near a Southwest Airlines flight, in a drone opportunity if I can. But just generally speaking whether it is bird and bird strikes or drones or any other type of activity the airline industry is interested in making sure that the airspace especially above the airports coming into those critical times are well regulated and maintained. So the industry is very supportive of having some type of regulatory requirements and oversight for drones having them registered, having them have certain requirements in terms of their operations trying to limit their availability especially in critical airspace close to the airport. And I know that the FAA is focused on that. I know that there are several other regulatory groups and trying to figure out how we control all this new technology. A - Gary Kelly : You're focused on when they're not on furlough. That is critical. It would be nice to have them off furlough so they can be focused on what is an important question. Q - Robert Silk : Thanks. I appreciate it. End of Q&A: Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Greg, appreciate it. Thank you all for joining us today. Of course, if you have any other questions, our communications group is standing by 214-792-4847, or you can certainly reach us through the media site www.swamedia.com. Thanks so much. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be made available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Cody, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on the call today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of our senior leadership team. Please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, and these are based on our current intent, expectations and projections. As we noted in our earnings release this morning, we have made flight schedule adjustments through August 5 as a result of the MAX groundings. And the guidance we will provide today is based on our estimates assuming the grounding of the MAX through August 5. A variety of factors, in particular those that are out of our control in connection with the MAX groundings, could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current guidance. We'll also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. And for more information regarding forward-looking statements and our reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results, please visit the Investor Relations section of southwest.com. So with that intro, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. Overall, I am as proud as I have ever been of our people. They did an extraordinary job, produced solid results among industry-leading margins and despite the challenges of near-record cancellations. But for the numerous cancellation events, it would have been a blowout quarter. But still, rock-solid margins, returns and cash flows, and a huge thank-you to our people for their resilience and for their perseverance. Based on where we are today and what we can see from today, the second quarter will be better. We're better prepared to handle the MAX schedule changes, prospectively through August 5, rather than the more chaotic daily cancellations. And our goal is to provide our customers a stellar experience during the busy summer, especially. Our on-time performance was solid in the first quarter, and it will be solid again here in the second quarter. Restoring the MAX to service as soon as it's ready is also a priority, of course. And assuming that happens within the next couple of months, we'll get back on our delivery schedule and our capacity plan. Mike, Tom and Tammy have prepared excellent briefings on our operations, commercial, and financial performances and expectations, and I don't want to steal their thunder, so I'm going to be brief this morning. But I did want to reiterate a couple of points. Despite the challenging year so far, first of all, we were once again named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. This year, ranked number 11. We were just ranked number 2 out of 500 companies on Forbes List of Best Employers. And all great companies start and end with having great people and being a great employer. So we're very proud of that. We were number 1 in the DOT rankings for 2018, Customer Satisfaction, again. And we're off to a great start in 2019. Our brand and NPS scores remain strong in 2019 and industry-leading as well. We have a balance sheet leverage of less than 28%. We have almost $3.9 billion in cash. We have an excellent, cost-effective and risk off fuel hedge in place for the next several years. Our Hawaii expansion is off to an exceptional start, and of course, that is despite having numerous distractions in the first quarter. Our technology plans for this year and next are ambitious, but they are proceeding well and on track. And then, finally, I expect us to make progress on our cost initiatives this year except for the capacity cuts effect, of course. And we're not giving up on our goal to expand margins and return on capital year-over-year. Despite the challenges, we may very well set records in some financial categories this year. But having said that, I admit that there's uncertainty surrounding a lot of things, certainly the timing of the MAX and, as usual, the economy and fuel prices. But, we're off to a good start. And we're planning on having a good year and making a lot of progress this year. So with that very quick overview, let me turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven. Mike? Mike Van de Ven : Well, thanks, Gary. The first quarter reinforced a couple things that I already know. Most important being that our people will absolutely rise to meet any challenge. And we had our fair share of challenges to start the year. The prevalent operational themes for the first quarter were launching our Hawaii service, and then, of course, the unanticipated maintenance rise up and our MAX groundings have impacted our operations. So, as you all will remember, the quarter started the minute the government shutdown in the middle of our ETOPS authorization. We had worked on some contingency plans, and despite losing about a month of timing, were still able to launch Oakland to Honolulu service in the first quarter as planned. And since then, we've added an Oakland to Maui, and we're going to launch service between Maui and Honolulu on Sunday. The service startup went extremely well. Our onboard experience has received high customer marks, and we are continuing to add service during the second quarter. Beginning in mid-February, we started to experience disruptions to the operations with unexpected maintenance write-ups. And just as that was returning to normal levels in mid-March, the MAX groundings occurred. Those combined items created unexpected, irregular operations to the last half of the quarter. So we were operating in a daily environment that consisted of canceled and delayed flights, aircraft swaps, crew reroutes, high volumes to our call centers, maintenance demand and logistics associated with the grounding and, of course, the customer anxiety at the airports. But our people, across the board, again, rose to the occasion and they took superb care of our customers and produced a very solid operational performance in spite of that environment. Our on-time performance for the quarter was 78.7, and that was just a tad lower than last year's 79.3. And if we adjusted for the maintenance and the MAX impacts, our on-time performance would have modeled in the 83% range, and that would have put us second in the industry from a marketing carriers perspective. That's a good indication that the network design and our operational approach are in sync and we have a strong operational foundation as we move forward. Southwest had the top ranking for fewest customer complaints for domestic marketing carriers in 2018, as measured by the DOT. And as Gary mentioned, we maintained that position in both January and February, which are the latest results. And again, that's just additional evidence that our people are really leaning in to providing great hospitality and service to all of our customers. And our people have really owned the disruptions that these issues have caused our customers. Cumulatively, the weather and the maintenance write-ups and the MAX groundings, they caused significant cancellations. We canceled more than 10,000 flights during the quarter, roughly 4% of our published schedule. That was significantly more than we would have expected going into the quarter and, in fact, that's the highest level of cancellations since the third quarter of 2001, which was impacted by 9/11. Of course, we got much higher load factors and fewer seats to reaccommodate impacted customers today. But over the years, we've made significant investments in several operational recovery tools that minimize the impact on our customers for those issues. So, in the first quarter environment, 97.5% of our customers got to their destinations the same day as scheduled. And that's compared to 97.8% last year when these issues didn't exist. So a very solid, very customer-service-driven result, given the unexpected challenges. Turning to the MAX. We have 34 MAX aircraft grounded, 33 of them are in Victorville, California. We still have the one aircraft in Orlando that had the engine issue during the ferry flight. We're in the process of doing an engine change on that aircraft. It will be ferried to Victorville sometime over the next week. Having all the airplanes in one place improves the efficiency of our maintenance program for the aircraft as well as relaunching the fleet when we're able to do so. We're using this additional downtime to do any necessary inspections or planned work so that when the fleet can be relaunched, it's as close to being a new delivery aircraft from a maintenance perspective as possible. Getting all 34 aircraft to relaunch and back in service is expected to take a month or so. We're still working on those detailed plans. The aircraft will need software upgrades as well as make-ready-to-fly work, and that includes things like unsealing the aircraft, oil and fluid checks, required inspections, system checks, cabin cleaning, those types of things. Of course, there will also be additional FAA pilot training requirements that will also need to be completed. As Gary and Ryan mentioned, we've removed the airplane from our scheduled service through August 5. Assuming that the airplanes are cleared to fly before then, we'll pragmatically bring them back into our operational fleet and will utilize them as spares to support the network. They will begin to fly in a normal scheduled service pattern beginning August 6. And of course, if the groundings continue past that date, we'll need to make further adjustment to the schedule. So, as we move into the second quarter, our operational theme is to provide an exceptional customer experience over the summer. Our unexpected maintenance events are behind us since we agreed to the tentative agreement with AMFA. AMFA's in the process of educating our mechanics on the agreement. We expect the voting results in the second half of May. The MAX flights have been pulled out of our schedules and all impacted customers have been contacted, and are in the process of being reaccommodated. And given the related capacity pull down, we are left across the busy summer travel period so that we can provide exceptional service. We're focused on getting our customers the safe, reliable, on-time and fun experience that they're accustomed to on Southwest. And so with that, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Nealon : Okay. Thanks, Mike. So, as you all know, we finished 2018 very strong. We came into 2019 with a lot of momentum. And I think that despite several significant challenges, we have delivered a very strong revenue performance going into -- in the first quarter. In fact, we achieved record first quarter operating revenues of $5.1 billion and our year-over-year unit revenue performance is expected to be among the top in the industry. And just to add on to what Gary said, the people of Southwest Airlines, they carried the day throughout the quarter under very, very tough circumstances. We had a lot of cancellations, a lot of reaccoms, and they serve our customers with the hospitality and the kindness that we are famous for. So it's been a challenging quarter, and you all did an incredible job. In our March 27 investor update, we shared the details behind the drivers of our revised Q1 RASM forecast, which we said would be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. And we ended the first quarter at the high end of that guidance, with RASM growth of 2.7%. So let me start the quick recap of Q1, and then I'll cover our outlook for the second quarter. So, in January, we were expecting Q1 RASM to increase in the range of 4% to 5%. And just as a reminder, there were several key factors that went into that original guidance : first, a continuation of the strength in the base business trends that we experienced in Q3 and Q4 of 2018; second, the benefit from November's system-wide fare increase; third, continued strong performance from our Rapid Rewards program; fourth, 1.5 points year-over-year RASM benefit from our new res system; and finally, a 1.5 RASM tailwind from Q1 2018's suboptimal flight schedule. We also planned for a roughly $40 million shift in the revenue from Q1 to Q2 due to the Easter shift. And we also plan to grow our Q1 capacity by approximately 3.5% to 4%. So that's what the plan was based on. Let me quickly recap what's occurred since our earnings call in January. So first, as we shared previously, we quantified the impact of the government shutdown to be roughly $60 million. And obviously, government-related business travel was the most easily identified. But we also began to see a clear trend change and leisure demand softened with the prolonged shutdown. And this continued pretty much throughout the quarter. Versus our original Q1 RASM expectation of plus 4% to 5%, the shutdown impact is what caused us to revise our Q1 RASM guidance down a full point to plus 3% to 4%. Second, the unscheduled maintenance events was another large contributor, resulting in a little more than 0.5 points reduction to Q1 RASM. And this essentially lasted from mid-February through mid-March. Third, the March 13 grounding of our MAX fleet was the next largest revenue drag. It was a slight benefit, actually, to our Q1 RASM. And fourth, softness and leisure demand in yields, which is really related to the government shutdown, was approximately 0.5 points negative impact to Q1 RASM. I think it's important to call out right now that this trend has changed and we're seeing leisure demand and yield strength in the second quarter. So, we ended the quarter with over $200 million off our original revenue forecast, and we ended the quarter about 2.5 points below our capacity plan. Now part of the RASM impact we saw, particularly in February and March, was due to having less inventory available for higher-yield close-in bookings. We had to use a lot of this close-in inventory to reaccommodate our customers due to the maintenance disruptions and the MAX grounding. Now, in contrast to the unscheduled maintenance disruptions, which were very unpredictable day in, day out, and very difficult for our employees and our customers, we were much better able to get out in front of the MAX cancellations to minimize the impact to our customers. And we were much more proactive in reaccomodating our customers several days in advance of the flight date. So having said all that, our close-in yields remained strong year-over-year. Business travel demand continued to be strong as well. But we took fewer close-in bookings simply because of the reduced inventory per sale. Our revenue management capabilities continued to perform very well and drove a 1 point year-over-year RASM benefit in the quarter, which was slightly lower than our original expectation of 1.5 points. And this is due to the softer trends I just mentioned as well as the reduction in inventory. Our industry-leading Rapid Rewards program is performing extremely well and is continuing to grow double digits, both in terms of the size of the customer portfolio as well as in terms of the total loyalty revenue. We are continuing to see tremendous strength across every metric of Rapid Rewards, and this was on an already strong base. In Q1, we saw record acquisitions in new Rapid Rewards members. We also saw our highest ever acquisition of new co-brand credit card holders. And we're also seeing very high retention rates, which is a great combination. So again, our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform extremely well. Our customers love the benefits and the value of the program, and there is a lot of runway in front of us for continued growth. In terms of our ancillary products, they also contribute to the first quarter's RASM performance, also with strong double-digit performance in our boarding products, including continued strength in the variable pricing of our EarlyBird product that we implemented last fall. That pricing structure is working very well and it's meeting all of our expectations. I think EarlyBird also benefited from our improved merchandising capabilities on Southwest.com. And we will continue to invest our industry-leading, direct-to-consumer Southwest.com platform. Our international markets are also doing very well and continue to develop and mature. Though this is only 4% of our system capacity, we are really pleased with the performance that we're seeing. RASM, yields, load factors are all strengthening, and our international business is developing as planned. And we're also seeing noteworthy performance in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Finally, we launched our service to Hawaii on March 17. We began our initial flights by connecting Oakland to Honolulu and Maui. And as you know, we began our Hawaii flights with very low initial pricing. And if you look at where we are today, we are moving up the pricing ladder to what we consider to be normal pricing levels, and we're seeing very strong demand in bookings. And while it's a small sample set, the early feedback from our customers, as Mike alluded to, is absolutely exceptional, and their satisfaction with the in-flight experience is actually higher than the rest of our system, which, as you know, has always had extremely high Net Promoter Score. I think this clearly speaks to the strength and the quality of our economy product, and not just on short- and medium-haul trips, but on long-haul trips as well. So, in summary, for Q1, a lot has happened over the past 3 months. Several things have happened that we certainly did not anticipate, but a lot of things also happened that we did expect. We saw a 1.5 point year-over-year tailwind in the Q1 2018 suboptimal schedule. We saw a continuation of strong year-over-year close-in yields. We saw another very strong performance from Rapid Rewards, and we saw a healthy year-over-year RASM benefit from our revenue management enhancements. And just as a footnote, this our highest year-over-year quarterly RASM since the third quarter of 2014. So that's it for Q1. Now, let's talk about the second quarter. So we are expecting strong year-over-year Q2 RASM performance in the range of up 5.5% to 7.5%. And this is based on the current booking curves and pricing trends that we're seeing. This is a strong year-over-year improvement as well as compared with Q1. And recent demand and yield trends have stabilized and are improving. Earlier this month, as you know, we republished our schedule for April 7 through August 5, and the intent was very simple, to get us back to a schedule that we knew we could fly with the 700s and 800s that were in our fleet. As we removed MAX flight from the schedule, we're doing it in a way that maintains the integrity of our network and the strength of our schedule. And until the MAX is back in service, we intend to operate a slightly reduced schedule, but with the reliability and the hospitality that we're famous for. It's a better and more efficient way to run the operation, and that's what our employees and our customers need from us. Now, keep in mind that because of the MAX grounding, we'll have less close-in seat inventory just because we're having to reaccommodate impacted customers on new itineraries, which by definition is being done with close-in seat inventory. So this will have an impact on close-in, higher-yield April bookings. We saw improvements in bookings in yields for Easter, and we're also seeing improvement in both May and June. The demand that we're seeing is solid for both leisure and business travel, and close-in fares are holding up very nicely, and we're seeing a continuation of strength in close-in yields year-over-year. So, the bottom line is that we're encouraged by the improvements that we're seeing in Q2. And just as a reminder, we had a 3 point RASM headwind in Q2 of 2018 and 2 things drove this. First, we had the 1-point impact from the suboptimal flight schedule and, second, we had a 2-point impact following Flight 1380. So this equates to a 3 point RASM tailwind for Q2 2019. We also had a 0.5 points year-over-year RASM benefit due to the Easter shift into Q2. So, similar to the first quarter, we expect around 1 point in year-over-year RASM benefit in Q2 from our reservation system, and this is in comparison to roughly 0.5 points of RASM benefit in Q2 of last year. And we expect about a 1-point RASM benefit in Q2 due to lower capacity as a result of the MAX groundings. And finally, we expect another strong performance from our Rapid Rewards program in the second quarter as well as continued strength and growth in our ancillary revenues. As we said, Hawaii is off to a great start. It has exceeded our expectations in March, due to the overwhelming demand in our initial flights. And despite a very short 2-week booking window, our first flights sold out very quickly. In fact, initial flights were sold out before we were even able to get the first e-mail out to Rapid Reward members. So, this coming Sunday, we'll continue. We'll begin in and around service between Honolulu and Maui, and we'll connect Honolulu and Kona on May 12. On May 5, we'll launch service from our second California gateway, San Jose, to Honolulu, and on May 26, we'll connect San Jose to Maui. We have more Hawaii service to come, and we are very pleased with how these markets are performing. And the expansion of Southwest service into Hawaii is our primary route development focus for 2019 to 2020. And that will also include more inter-island service. So, to wrap it up, first quarter was challenging across many fronts, certainly for revenue. And I am very proud of our people and I'm very proud of our first quarter results. And we are off to a solidly positive RASM performance for the year. Our goal to grow 2019 RASM in excess of 3% year-over-year has not changed. We're dealing with some unforeseen circumstances, but we are focused on those things that we can control. The strength of the Southwest brand remains very high. Our customer service and our brand NPS scores continue to be at the very top, the very top of the industry. We're continuing to grow our customer base, in particular, our most valuable customer segments, as well as in key markets. So, we have a lot of momentum coming out of Q1 and our immediate focus is on solid execution in Q2. And just like in Q1, our outlook for Q2 RASM should be at or near the very top of the industry again. So, with that, let me turn it over to Tammy to take us through the financials. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Tom. And hello, everyone. Gary, Mike and Tom have outlined the challenges that we've been managing through since the beginning of the year, and I'd like to add my thanks to all of our hardworking employees for their resilient focus today good care of our customers and for their unwavering commitment to Southwest. Despite the significant headwinds, we are off to a solid start to the year, with almost a 10% pretax margin, and we continue to consistently generate strong cash flows and shareholder returns. I want to also thank our people for their focus on cost control in the midst of all the challenges. Our first quarter nominal cost, excluding fuel and profit sharing, were relatively in line with where we expected them to be at the beginning of the quarter, despite the numerous headwinds. On a unit basis, ex fuel, special items and profit sharing, our cost increased 8.1% year-over-year. Relative to the approximately 6% we were expecting back in January, there were 2 primary drivers of the higher year-over-year growth. First, the flight cancellations that we experienced reduced our available seat mile growth in first quarter by about 2.5 points year-over-year. And combined with additional cost pressures from maintenance-related disruptions and weather increased our CASM-Ex by about 3 points, since we didn't have opportunities to shed costs that were predominantly fixed at close-in. Second, we had a $30 million increase to salary, wages and benefits due to our tentative agreement with AMFA, which represents a higher compensation for our mechanics compared with the previously rejected TA from last fall. This created another point of year-over-year CASM-Ex increase in first quarter. This 4-point negative CASM-Ex impact was offset by about 2 points due to better-than-expected completion factor, employee productivity and health care trends, as well as the shifting of advertising and airport costs out of first quarter and into future quarters this year. This resulted in an 8.1% increase in our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing year-over-year. So, to recap, if you exclude the impacts from the unexpected events, first quarter 2019 CASM-Ex growth would have been in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. Looking to second quarter, our expectations back in January were for year-over-year cost inflation ex fuel and profit sharing in the 6% range similar to our initial first quarter estimates. As a reminder, the key drivers of our initial expectations were the underutilization of our fleet in first half 2019 due to the delay in our service to Hawaii and the resulting onetime startup cost; higher airport, labor and ownership costs; as well as the timing of maintenance events and technology investments. While those drivers are still relevant, the reduced capacity from our MAX grounding for second quarter is now driving an additional 5 points of inflationary pressure, net of some flight crew and landing fee efficiencies from proactive flight cancellations beginning in early April versus our immediate cancellations in March. And we have about 0.5 points negative impact from advertising and airport cost shifting from first quarter. As a result, we now expect second quarter CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, to increase in the 10.5% to 12.5% range year-over-year. Looking to the back half of this year, we initially expected flat CASM-Ex. With our MAX groundings extended through August 5, we now estimate about 3 points of incremental unit cost pressure in third quarter 2019 based on flight cancellations to date. And while we hope this doesn't persist any longer, there is still uncertainty around the timing of the MAX returning to service. That said, based on what we know today, we continue to expect sequential improvement in the year-over-year CASM-Ex fuel and profit sharing from second to third to fourth quarter. For full-year 2019 costs, under the assumption that MAX groundings do not extend beyond August 5, we currently estimate CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, will increase in the 5.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This includes about a 2-point headwind from lower capacity as a result of the MAX groundings and 0.5 points of headwind due to the TA with AMFA. Of course, I will keep you updated as we learn more. Moving on to fuel. Fuel prices have increased since the beginning of the year with fixed Brent crude up 25% in first quarter since January 1. Also, our fuel efficiency improvement has been impacted by the MAX grounding. That said, our first quarter economic fuel price was in line with our most recent guidance, at $2.05 per gallon. We have great fuel-hedging protection in place this year with 78% hedge in second quarter and 60% to 65% hedge in the second half of the year. Our hedging premiums for this year remain at approximately $95 million or about $0.04 per gallon. Our 2019 hedging protection produces modest gains at current market prices and kicks in more materially at a 75 Brent crude equivalent. So we are very well-prepared should we continue to see rising energy prices. And as a reminder, our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude. Our hedging portfolio continues to be structured so that we fully participate in any market declines. For second quarter 2019 and full year 2019, based on market prices as of April 18 and given our current hedge, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.10 to $2.20 range. Fuel efficiency improved a modest 0.5% at first quarter, which was understandably lower than expected with the grounding of our 34 most fuel-efficient MAX aircraft in mid-March. Also, heavy winter weather also drove a higher fuel consumption than we had planned. Second quarter fuel efficiency is expected to be flat to down 1% year-over-year as the MAX has been removed from the entire second quarter flight schedule. For the full year, 2019 fuel efficiency is now expected to be flat to up 1% year-over-year. That said, fuel efficiency improvement remains a material part of our longer-term cost story once the MAX is back in service and more fuel-efficient aircraft will comprise a growing percentage of our total fleet. Turning now to our industry-leading balance sheet. Our strong financial position earned us an upgrade to A- from Fitch during the quarter, which we are thrilled about. We ended the quarter with ample cash and short-term investments of $3.9 billion, with our $1 billion revolver fully available. We adopted the new lease standard as of January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. And as a result, the primary impact was to the balance sheet. We recognized a $1.5 billion operating lease right-of-use asset, which is primarily comprised of aircraft operating leases and airport operating leases and a corresponding liability. We also removed $1.7 billion of assets constructed for others and the related construction obligation of $1.6 billion for completed airport terminal projects such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby and Fort Lauderdale. The net impact was approximately a $270 million reduction to the balance sheet. The impact to the income statement was immaterial. We have very manageable debt obligations and capital spending plans for 2019. And at this point, we continue to expect 2019 CapEx in the $1.9 billion to $2 billion range, based on the remaining Boeing deliveries scheduled for this year. On non-aircraft CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technology, and we are making good progress on a new maintenance system. Our significant airport investments in LAX, Kansas City, Baltimore, Nashville and Boston are under way, and progress is being made on our maintenance hangar investment in Houston, Phoenix and Denver. We expect our investments to help drive incremental revenue and productivity as well as support longer-term cost objectives and our growth plans. We had strong cash flows in first quarter, allowing us to return $678 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Lastly, on fleet and capacity. We ended first quarter with 753 aircraft in our fleet, taking delivery of 3 leased MAX 8 aircraft so far this year. We are currently working through the delivery delays with Boeing, but we don't have any updates to share at this point. Although our 41 remaining aircraft deliveries this year are on hold, the majority of them are back half loaded. As a reminder, we have 28 owned MAX aircraft from Boeing and 13 additional leased MAX aircraft in our order book for 2019. We are evaluating our fleet retirement plans, but at this point, we continue to expect to retire as many as 18 aircraft this year, but that will obviously be subject to the duration of the MAX groundings. Our retirements helped with our fleet modernization efforts, improving efficiency, reliability, fuel burn, and reducing our maintenance burden. In second quarter, given MAX flight cancellations, we now expect capacity to be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. And for full year 2019, based on what we know to date, and given MAX flight cancellations through August 5, we now estimate our annual 2019 capacity will increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. Our schedule is currently published through early November, and that includes the first phase of our Hawaii plan, as Tom covered. And we'll evaluate further flight schedule revisions based on the duration of the MAX grounding. So in closing and as a quick recap on what we shared today, despite the ongoing MAX groundings, our employees continued to rally and take great care of our customers. Our revenue management system is producing revenue gains and performing exactly as we expect it to, and we are expecting strong year-over-year RASM growth in second quarter. We have a great fuel hedging protection for our 2019 and beyond in place to mitigate rising fuel prices. Flight cancellations and lower capacity is putting pressure on our nonfuel unit costs, though we continue to focus on strict cost control and being nimble. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect solid margins in 2019, with the opportunity to deliver stellar returns on capital. We continue to make important investments in our people, our fleet, the airports we serve and technology, which will support our scalability and many future growth opportunities, including Hawaii. Another huge thank-you to all of our employees who are managing through a lot and continue to do a terrific job. With that, Cody, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with our first question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : Gary, hypothetically, how many consecutive quarters of stagnation, from a capacity perspective, would you be willing to tolerate before possibly considering nonorganic growth opportunities? Gary Kelly : Oh, wow. Well, we've been asked several variations of that question, although not that one exactly. And right now, I'll just ask our folks to stay focused. We have a very good plan for 2019. We're not at the point yet where we need to call any material audibles. We're working on -- the MAX is pretty much the audible that is tasking our group right now. I have not asked them to consider contingency Plan B, C, D, E or whatever it might be. So, I just don't have a ready answer to that question. I think all of us are working under a reasonable assumption that the MAX is going to return to service in a reasonable amount of time. And then, whether we're back to normal, sometime during the third quarter or to begin the fourth quarter, in the grand scheme of things, is probably somewhat immaterial. I think what all of us are a little more concerned about is if that goes on too long, we have a -- Tammy referred to this, so we have a retirement program. So, Jamie, I think what we would be -- what we would have to scratch our heads with more is just from an operational perspective, we've already planned retirements. And that would imply that capacity goes down from here. But we certainly don't want that. And it would be a lot of work for us to go in and unwind our retirement plan, and I do not want to do that. That would not be efficient. We've got better things to work on, quite frankly. You've asked a much broader, more strategic question. And that's a pretty -- that's an outlier in terms of a scenario. And I just don't -- I don't think that, that is anything that we'll be spending any time thinking about right now. But clearly, strategically, we're in a growth mode, so is the industry. We need to be growing. And we don't -- we -- clearly, we do not want this stagnation, to use your word, to continue very long. But I just don't have a ready answer on that question. And I don't think that, that is a likely scenario. Jamie Baker : Yes. That's very helpful, Gary. No, I appreciate it. A quick follow-up. In the event that the FAA does not require any sim time, and it seems to be moving in that direction, but other regulatory agencies do or other pilot unions do, whether here or abroad, is this a scenario that you've discussed with SWAPA at all? I mean, is there a risk that even if the FAA goes with an iPad-training protocol, just the public scrutiny and/or union pressures might lead you to nonetheless pursue sim-based training as a part of the return to service, because that would obviously slow the process down, possibly, quite a bit. Gary Kelly : Well, again, just taking your question literally, which I think is the way you intend it, yes, I think that just getting pilots back into the simulator for an event would be a challenge, and that would take time. I think it just depends on what training one is talking about because our pilots are extensively trained. And again, I'm a layperson at this. But my own interpretation is that we already do the kind of training that one would be contemplating to put the MAX back into service. Mike, how many MAX simulators are there even in the world? So -- but the point is, managing the aircraft in a runway stabilizer scenario is something that we already train on and at least as best I can tell has already been covered. So again, I would just go back to we don't know what that would mean precisely. But at this point, we're not hearing that, that will be a requirement. I just go back to we are the most experienced 737 operator in the world. Our pilots are extensively trained. We don't hire them unless they have a tremendous amount of experience, Captain experience, for that matter. So regardless, we'll do whatever we have to do here, but we're obviously awaiting the Boeing service bulletin as well as the FAA or worthiness directive to know exactly what we'll have to do. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : So maybe I'm reading too much into this sentence. But the CapEx reiteration for this year has this clause of \"assuming no prolonged grounding of the MAX aircraft.\" So is that to suggest that you might not take delivery of aircraft that you're scheduled to in the back half if it's still grounded and that CapEx would actually come down? Gary Kelly : No. I think that -- I'll just be explicit. We are not taking any deliveries right now and, therefore, we're not paying for anything. So if you just took your scenario, and we don't get any more MAXes delivered in 2019, our CapEx would be dramatically lower. But Boeing cannot deliver an airplane now. So any airplanes that they are manufacturing, again, just to be crystal clear, they're at Boeing Field. And so they are not being delivered and we're not paying for them. Did I get that right, Tammy? Tammy is the one who sends the money. So, I just think she... Tammy Romo : We will be writing our check as they are delivered. Gary Kelly : There you go. So hopefully, that answers your question. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then, just with respect to the longer-term cost profile. At the start out this year, obviously, there was some first half pressure. There's been a lot of noise and changes around this grounding. But you had talked about a flattening of the cost profile into 2020. Given the extra cost pressure that you're seeing this year, can you just update us on your thoughts of what the cost profile might look like into 2020? Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. And Duane, that's what I was attempting to, at very high level, comment on in my remarks is that -- and Tammy mentioned this. So we're asking all of our departments to hit their budgets. And then, where they have activity-driven kinds of spending to obviously come in under their budgets. So we're not burning as much jet fuel, as one example. We're not incurring as many landings and takeoffs from a landing fees and rentals perspective. So to the extent that we have variable costs, we expect our departments to come in under. We have a series of cost initiatives to improve our efficiency. Those are continuing. And let's just assume that the MAX is back in the fleet in the summertime. I would expect us to hit our cost plan for the fourth quarter, which would be pure. You'd have a -- we'd have our schedule restored. We'd have all of our fleet. And I would expect the cost comparisons year-over-year to be quite good. I think it's a little -- and Tammy and Ryan get this question a lot right now, just trying to project forward to 2020 and what will the costs look like. Again, under that same assumption that we've restored the flying of the MAX this year, we don't see any different cost performance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, the comps are going to be dependent upon what ultimately happens here in 2019. But the cost outlook should be unchanged, based on that report. Tammy Romo : Yes. So, certainly, by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we would expect to be on a good trajectory assuming the MAX are back in service at that time. So completely agree. Gary Kelly : Now if Jamie's question all of a sudden becomes more of an issue, there's extra training or the training delays the MAX flying or whatever it might be, you understand that I'm not incorporating those unexpected events into that kind of a comment. It's assuming that we're back up and running as per normal with that kind of an outlook. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Thanks for all the color on this call today. And just to follow up on that line of questioning from Duane, is it fair to assume that the underlying ASM production on your 2020 CASM will be whatever was in the baseline for last year plus whatever is taking out -- I'm sorry, for next year, whatever's taken out for the MAX this year? Meaning, like 4% or 5% baseline plus 2%, 2.5% for the MAX groundings? Is that a fair way to think about that as you're thinking about the CASM profile for next year? Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. And, Hunter, the other -- we built the airline to support by year-end Ryan's 775 airplanes, then we've got another 25-ish coming in 2020. So yes, we want to get airplanes and we want to fly them. So the capacity that we're thinking of to begin this year for 2020, that's what I want us to fly. Now again, there's still questions about exactly how the MAX will re-enter service. But assuming everything comes back online and we're up and running, we get all the airplanes, as we have committed to Boeing and they've committed to us, then yes, we would be flying the 2020 plan as we started this year. Hunter Keay : Okay, great. And then can you talk about the 800 in Hawaii and any maybe operational challenges that you've had with that plane? I know why you flew it there originally. It makes sense. But it's probably not the most ideally suited aircraft for doing that in the MAX. Any operational challenges that you've had there? And also if you could kind of elaborate on how you're cracking the distribution nut inter-island Hawaii, particularly within the local community there? Gary Kelly : I'll ask Mike to speak to the operational aspect and Tom to talk about the distribution. Mike Van de Ven : So yes, so we really aren't having any, what I would call, significant operational issues with the 800. We're very comfortable with the airplane. We knew, though, that given its range that we would -- we may have to put some lids on the seats, especially in -- when you're flying against some of those headwinds. So that's been the biggest operational challenge for us. We're scanning bags on there, the weight balance program works well. We've got it blocked pretty well. The station performance, we're fully staffed in the stations. The people out there are excited. They're turning the airplanes well. So we're just -- we're learning how to navigate through the Honolulu airport a little bit better and the taxi times on the ground there. But in terms of the operation, the maintenance and the support and the crews of the airplane, all going as planned. Tom Nealon : Hunter, I think on the distribution side, we started service back in March. We've been on the ground in Hawaii for well over a year in terms of community outreach, community affairs. And so we've already got a pretty deep roots for such new operation, pretty deep roots in the Hawaiian community. And so in terms of distribution, it's what we always do at southwest.com. So they know the brand better than I would have expected, actually, because many people from Hawaii are traveling to the U.S -- or to the mainland rather, and they're flying Southwest. They know the brand. So a lot of local marketing, a lot of presence. And we're actually seeing very strong, very, very strong reception to the Southwest brand on-island. So that's probably how I'd best answer it. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : First, just a clarification on the -- on some of the CASM questions from earlier. If capacity growth next year is going to end up being a lot higher simply because of the MAX timing, then shouldn't CASM actually be materially lower, say, flat to down versus that 1% to 2% or so that you were talking about before, Gary? Gary Kelly : I don't think I quoted a number. Well, I know I didn't quote a number. So I think all I was trying to communicate at this point, and so this is April, so we've got a ways to go before we get into 2020. But whatever CASM we were expecting in 2020 before the events of this year, that's what I would be expecting next year. How that will compare to 2019, I don't think we're ready to say yet. Clearly, we're running higher on CASM here in the first half and that'll probably dribble into the third quarter. Well, it will because we've already reduced our flight schedule through August 5. So yes, you're going to have an easier comp because of all of this. But I don't think we are prepared today to give you any insight as to what that would be. If you thought it was up 1 to 2 before, yes, I agree. It's going to be something less than that, I just don't know how much less yet. Tammy Romo : Yes, really nothing has changed from our last comment. So we're just setting aside all the noise from the unanticipated first quarter events, our long-term unit cost target remains unchanged. And so nothing -- no new update here today. Gary Kelly : Yes. So what I meant earlier was just a nominal amount, not a year-over-year amount. So what else can we do for you? Rajeev Lalwani : And then on the RASM side, Gary, I think you've laid out some objectives earlier in the year. There's been a lot that's moved around. Can you just refresh us on where you are with sort of hitting those targets and whether or not, and this may be for Tom, do you think you can keep some of the momentum that you're seeing in 2Q going into the back half of the year such that there's not this massive step down, if you will? Gary Kelly : Well, let me offer a quick comment, and then I know Tom will want to chime in here. In his remarks, he said that our goal remains in excess of 3% unit revenue growth for the year 2019 versus year ago. What I was intending to also suggest with my remarks is that we began the year with the goal to improve margins. We got a little bit of help on that front with lower fuel prices. That still is the case as we look forward today. We've got lower year-over-year fuel prices. We're a little wobbly with our fuel consumption numbers because of the MAX benefit we were getting and now not. But except for that, the fuel outlook still looks, at this juncture, looks really good. So we had a desire to drive better operating margins, net margins and returns on invested capital. That's not happening here in the first quarter. But I wouldn't give up on that especially in the second half of the year and for the full year. So our folks are doing a good job managing their cost. First quarter was really ragged with operations incurring -- even though we had fewer flights, there was more cost for per flight because of dealing with all of the irregular operations, as we call them. So that should perform, Mike, I think a lot better here in the second quarter because, like you and Tom were saying, we've gotten ahead of that. It's just a much more orderly way to reschedule the airline that way. So, Tom, you want to talk about the RASM? Tom Nealon : Yes, and I think I'd just kind of restate that the 3% objective is the flight we have in the ground. We're going for it. I think that's what we're seeing so far. The first quarter, as you guys know, was a very -- I think you keep hearing the word choppy. Every earnings call, I hear the word choppy. The first quarter was very, very choppy. And we're coming out of that and we're seeing really nice stabilization of trends. We're seeing normalization of the curves. We're seeing normalization of demand and the fare environment seems to be really where we need it to be. And I think that it's just a shame we have this MAX thing going on because it's a pretty good business environment. So our corporate travel, which is a really good indicator of just the economy, is robust. I wish we had more close-in inventory to sell, but we're re-accommodating. That's a pretty good indicator of this core economic strength, and the business climate or the business bookings are strong. Like I said, wish we had more to sell. But that's my commentary on that. Gary Kelly : And I think that's excellent. And I -- the one thing that I wanted to be sure that all of you took away from today, I read all kinds of crazy things about the impact on our brand and our customers are mad and on and on. Our business is really good. And it's in -- it's because our employees work so hard to serve our customers so well. So there are -- while no doubt there are always impacts to companies' brands based on things that happen, our brand is unbelievably strong and I think well deserved. And the operation integrity is intact and looks really, really solid, and there is no evidence of any weakness that is unique to Southwest after our first quarter, and I think we're all very proud of that. And again, very proud of our people for making that happen. Tammy Romo : And the only other point I would add on to that is the flexibility and the strength of our network is tremendous. And I think you are seeing that in our results as we work through all these cancellations. So I'd just put an exclamation point there. And then I would also just point out that we have a new reservation system, new revenue management tools, which are also helping us manage through all the challenges. So just the strengths of Southwest just really do go on and on. Gary Kelly : And the network changes, I think as some of you all have recognized, they were just masterfully done. So while we had to trim some capacity out, it was done in a way that, again, that also maintained the integrity of our customer offering. I'm very, very proud of that. Operator : We'll now move onto our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Gary, just to start off with you. It certainly sounds like Hawaii flying is off to a great start, both in terms of customer demand and also the experience. So now that you've got a couple of months under your belt in terms of booking trends, I'd just be curious to get your view on if the ramp time around those routes to get them towards system-level profitability has changed at all or if your sort of thoughts there have changed, given what you've experienced the last couple months. Gary Kelly : Well, again, I'll let Tom speak to that, too. I'll just give you my opinion about that. First of all, we're very good at forecasting. And that market forecast, at least to me in my experience, surprisingly well. And I think a lot of that is due to the fact that we have such an immense customer base in California, which is what this is geared for. And number two, because Hawaii is such a terrific destination that is missing from our flight schedule. But I did -- we haven't talked about international. International is a bigger segment of our system than Hawaii is, of course. And our international segment is developing very, very nicely. I was very pleased at the performance here in the first quarter. And I just offer that up as a contrast. I think our opportunity in Hawaii is far greater and far easier than what we are tackling in international markets just because we don't necessarily have the same relative strengths. And we certainly don't have the awareness in our international destinations about Southwest that we do, as Tom mentioned on Hawaii. But I don't see, Tom, that it's -- I mean first of all, we've just gotten started, to be fair to the question. But I certainly don't see anything that would discourage us. In fact, the fact that, as you pointed out, the flights sold out before we even put out a press release, I was stunned. But what are your thoughts? Tom Nealon : I think I've said this before, not sure I've said it on an earnings call, but we have such a built-in customer base in California wanting us to take them to Hawaii that I don't know how much faster than typically we should expect this to turn. I think this will develop faster than other new markets. You might have seen us do with international, where we don't have a built-in customer base. But I'm thrilled with where we are, but, yes, I did do some competitive shopping yesterday, just looking at the fares, and I really like where we are. I mean, we're very early into this and we're at pricing that is -- it's below the competition, but still it's good, solid, strong pricing. And not sure if you guys have taken a look at our pricing on dotcom versus our competition, but I love where we are very quickly in our development curve. So I think when you begin to add the bag fees, the first bag, second bag, third bag, there's a real dramatic difference. And we can make money at that price point because of our cost structure. And we feel great about it, this is kind of the Classic Southwest Effect. So I feel good about where we are, Jack. Gary Kelly : And I do want to make sure that -- there was a question earlier, I just want to make sure that we were clear. And Mike commented on this. But we have 175 seats on these airplanes. We are not selling all 175, for operational reasons. And so that is -- and that was Mike's point earlier. So if you think about, in the context of your question, profitability, longer term, Mike, I think you would agree, the MAX will be the better airplane there. It just has better performance and better range characteristics. But even with that, I think we feel very good, and that's all factored into our modeling. And I just offer that up, Tom, because I think we have upside even to where we are today with the performance in those markets. Tom Nealon : I would agree with that. Jack Atkins : Well, that's great. And just for my follow-up, Gary, you alluded on the fourth quarter call to the potential for new revenue management levers that could be rolled out in 2020. And I know there have been a lot of things in terms of outside factors that have been taking up your bandwidth over the last few months. But is there anything you can update us on there in terms of the potential for revenue management opportunities as you look out into next year? Gary Kelly : I would say in terms of the distractions, sort of the unplanned, I don't -- Tom, I don't think that has an impact on the work that we're doing on these couple of secret initiatives. Tom Nealon : Nope. They're totally unconnected. Gary Kelly : So, but I don't think, Tammy, do we have a news to share yet? Tammy Romo : There is no news to share yet. So everyone's going to have to stay tuned there. Gary Kelly : So stay tuned please, sir. And then begging for your patience there, so coming soon. Operator : We'll take our last question from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll keep them short. Mike, I think you said it would take about a month once the grounding order is rescinded to get your 34 aircraft back into service; a number of things would have to happen there first. It sounds like there's some incremental costs associated with those preparations. So for you and Tammy, are those already embedded in your revised full year CASM-Ex guidance? Or are you not going to be picking up the tab on that and so, therefore, it is not included? Tammy Romo : Yes. We've done our best based on what we know to incorporate all of the associated costs in our guidance. And obviously, if anything changes there, we'll update you. But it includes our -- it's included. Joe Caiado : Okay. And then I was wondering, are you able to comment on the results of the inspections that you performed on the Wave 1B while they've been grounded and whether you've observed any kind of type of wear pattern that's different than what you expected? Mike Van de Ven : Joe, are you talking about the fuel nozzle coking? Joe Caiado : That's right, yes. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. So when we had -- on March 26, when we were ferrying that last flight from Orlando to Victorville, we did have the in-flight shutdown and it turned back to Orlando. So the working theory on that particular airplane was that there was coking around the fuel nozzles and it created a variance in the hot spots and cold spots in the engine and the hot spot in the engine, we had some damage with respect to a little pressure turbine. So GE went out and asked -- the good thing about the engine temperatures and fuel coking is it's pretty manageable. It builds over time. It lends itself to trends that are detectable and then you can go great procedures to go monitor and inspect and repair or replace those things. So as you asked the industry to look at 25 engines. We looked at 12 of ours. And we've done some engine replacements. We've done some nozzle replacements. The way we're thinking about our fleet sitting down, and I mentioned it earlier, we like to almost get it at a new delivery status when it comes back up and flying. And so if we can do an engine change on that and it precludes us from having to do inspections after we relaunch the fleet, we'd rather go do things like that. Gary Kelly : Joe, I think the only thing I would add to that is that every new engine, at least in my experience, has its -- I would just call it, break-in issues. And it doesn't matter whether it's a CFM engine or some other manufacturer. And our technical operations work with the manufacturer to develop inspections and repair processes. And they are doing what they need to do to maintain these engines. So I think in that regard, I didn't want you to get the impression that we are doing investigative work here on the engines right now. We're not doing that. We know what we need to be doing. We're working with CFM to clear some of these items out so that they don't have to be inspected and, especially the fuel nozzle example that Mike was using, as frequently. But it's not unusual for an engine to have some break-in things happen. And the engine for the most part has performed in line with our expectations, especially with the fuel efficiency. It's a great, quiet ride and it's a good engine, and I expect to -- I only expect it to get better. Ryan Martinez : Well, great, that concludes the analyst portion of our call. Of course, if you have any other questions, please reach out to me. And thank you all for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Cody. And welcome to the members of our meeting on today's call. We'll go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion. And, Cody, if you would just go ahead and give them instructions on how to queue up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Can you tell us anything about sort of how you're thinking about steps you'll take once the MAX is eventually allowed to fly again, steps you'll take to reassure passengers, set people's minds at ease that it is safe? Have you started having those sorts of conversations with Boeing or with the pilots or flight crew? What kind of messaging should we expect around that? Gary Kelly : Alison, this is Gary. I think you should expect messaging. I don't think we're ready, Tom, to say exactly what that is yet. But it's a great airplane. Boeing is a great company. This is -- we're looking forward to, obviously, working with the FAA to get it ungrounded. And we'll gauge our messaging according to what questions our customers have, to a large degree. But, Tom, any thoughts you want to share there? Tom Nealon : That's a pretty good question. I think everyone's asking the same question. There's just so much media and coverage on the topic that everyone's got an opinion, and I think that there's certainly going to be some people that I expect would probably book away for some period of time. That's probably -- I have no idea how to quantify that, by the way. But I think there will be some people that do that. I think we have a very good understanding between our marketing team and our communications team. We're doing a lot of work understanding what our customers' perceptions are, what their understanding is of the issues, what their awareness is of the issues, what their concerns are with the issues. So I think we have a pretty good perspective on that. I think what's also pretty interesting, at least from my perspective, is since this has been going on, our customers' perception of the Southwest Airlines, the brand, the company, the people, has not changed at all with the grounding of the MAX. There's some words that they use when they talk to us about what they think of us and they use words like they're very loyal to Southwest. They have a lot of confidence in Southwest. They have a lot of trust in Southwest. And I think they have good reason to have confidence and trust because, as you've heard throughout the call, we know the 737 better than any carrier in the world, and they understand that about us. So we're working through our plan right now. And I can tell you that we'll have a very comprehensive plan that communicates directly to our customers and our employees every step of the way. But that's -- there's more work to be done as we learn more, but we're very focused on it. So appreciate the question. Gary Kelly : But we'll certainly want to share what we have done to satisfy ourselves that the airplane is ready to return to service. And I think Boeing has work to do to clarify exactly what this functionality is for, what it's not for, because I do think there is a lack of understanding in the media even. And so there's work to be done, I think, on both fronts. But I'm confident that we're up to that task. And I think what Tom mentioned again, we mentioned earlier, which is key, which is we have a great brand. It's one that people trust. And we earn that every day. So we'll want to certainly be mindful of that and message what we are comfortable in committing to. And clearly, we're not going to do anything that we think is unsafe. So that's not even a topic. That's not even a question. But I agree with Tom. I think that there'll be those questions and I think people will get -- I think they will quickly get comfortable with the answers. Alison Sider : And if I could just ask one follow-up. Have you been sort of surveying customers about how they're feeling about the MAX right now? Is that something you've been directly communicating about with people? And what kind of responses have you been getting? Gary Kelly : Yes. That's what Tom mentioned, is, yes, we're absolutely doing that. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Koenig from the Associated Press. David Koenig : Here is another of those questions, I guess. First, Gary, are you going to seek compensation from Boeing over the groundings? Can we talk about the hit to CASM, the additional fuel spending? Clearly, there's a hit to your revenue. And I'm also -- I'm sorry, it was hard to hear Tom, when he was talking about people booking away. But can you give some sense of what magnitude you expect that to be? Is it going to be serious enough that you might not be even be able to use all 34 of the planes you've got plus the 41 you're supposed to get? Gary Kelly : No. I don't think we're going to have any concern or any risk of using all 34 airplanes. And we'll fill them up just like we always do. The only point I was trying to make was there's certainly going to be some people that are concerned, and they may be intimidated to fly for some short period of time. I don't think it's going to be a massive issue for us. I think that our customers know us, trust us, they know we go the 737. So I don't want to overstate my comment or have my comment inflated. I was just raising that as I wouldn't surprise me if a few people said that. But I think we're going to be fine. David Koenig : I appreciate that clarification. That's good. But are you basing that on surveys that you're doing or are you basing that on history of past planes that have had accidents, what? Gary Kelly : Yes, we're basing that, David, on the customers that we are talking to. And we're doing a lot of research, if you will, with third parties as well as directly with our customers. And we're very attentive to what is the customer's perception of the brand through our trip Net Promoter Score as well as our brand Net Promoter Score as well as what we're hearing and seeing on social media. So I think we've got a really good handle on what our customers are thinking and feeling and what we need to be doing. And then on the Boeing aspect of your question, well, yes, we're not happy with this situation. Who would be? Boeing has already conceded that there are things that they need to address and, obviously, we totally agree with that. We have a great partnership. We're the -- I think without a doubt, the most successful airline in history. We've got an impeccable safety record. In terms of our partnership, what's important, obviously, is where we go from here. And I would fully expect that we'll continue to have a great partnership with the Boeing company. With respect to anything along the lines of business arrangements or our contract arrangements or whatever it might be, those are things that we'll take up with Boeing privately. And again, I would just restate the obvious, that this is not a good situation. And we'll all need to work together to work our way out of it. Boeing is a very fine company. They build fantastic airplanes. Mike has said this many times, when we launched the MAX, the MAX 8 we felt was the best narrow-body airplane in the world, ever. And there's every reason to believe that, that will continue to be the case once it returns to service with this software modification. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I have a couple of quick questions for Mike. Mike, I wanted to ask you following up on the Leap engine question, are you finding a degrading of any of the parts like the fuel nozzle sooner than you would've expected on those planes due to the coking? And my second question is, what intrigued you enough about the A220 that you actually went to Airbus to take a look at the plane? Tom Nealon : Well, starting on the fuel nozzle issue, Mary, I don't know if it's any sooner than we expected. Coking is not unusual. If there is a good thing about coking on fuel nozzles, they built over time, their trends are detectable and you can clearly create monitoring and inspection and repair or replace procedures to take care of all of that. As Boeing learns more about it, as they monitor their worldwide fleet, I'm certain that they will have design changes or design improvements that they will get into the production line and it will mitigate the inspections that we'll need to do on a go-forward basis. Gary Kelly : And I think that's key, Mary. Mike used the word learning and it was CFM, not Boeing. But it's anything that is new, there will be learnings. And there will be things that were designed and intended to operate -- or perform a certain way that don't. So that was the point I was trying to make early on the analyst call. That's certainly taking place here. Tom Nealon : Yes, Mary, I don't think that this Leap engine in its maturity, I don't think it\u2019s all -- its maturity curve is all that different than what this CFM engine was, what the gear turbo fan is, what the Rolls-Royce engine on the 787 is. They all have a kind of a maturity curve. And this one feels, at least in my history at Southwest, we feel like we're right on that curve. Gary Kelly : You make an excellent point. CFM 56 has been a phenomenal engine, and it had a rocky start. And whatever the CFM was before that on the Classic, same thing. It had kind of rocky start, and GE and CFM do a wonderful job. Do you want to talk about Airbus? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. So, Mary, our fleet team was down in Europe and visiting, but that's not anything unusual. We have relationships with all the OEMs, most of the lessors around the world. And we're just always out there trying to discuss and evaluate economics and opportunities in airplanes. And I had an opportunity to go out to the Paris Air Show last year. And it was a great opportunity for me because I got to talk with Boeing and GE about the MAX. I got to learn a little bit about Airbus and NEO. Bombardier was out there with the C Series at that time. I talked to Embraer. I talked to Pratt & Whitney. And it was just a great way to go, just gather information about the marketplace out there. Every one of those people have great products and great airplanes and really, that was just nothing more than our fleet team trying to gain a little understanding of what's out there. Gary Kelly : And, Mary, I did want to add to this, I want to be very clear, the timing is a bit unfortunate. And I dread speculation that it's intentional on our part to perhaps consider a change from our current direction with Boeing and the MAX, and that is not true. We didn't reveal that we took this trip. That was a leak by somebody. And so, again, I just wanted to point out there's -- we're not trying to send any message whatsoever. This trip was planned a long time ago, Mike. And so I'll just leave it at that. We have no plan to do anything other than grow our fleet with the MAX. Will that be the case into perpetuity? I'm not prepared to say that. But in any event, the timing is unfortunate. Mary Schlangenstein : So, Mike, did you like the A220? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. But, Mary, I like all new toys, shiny new toys. Gary Kelly : Well, it's a great airplane. It is a great airplane. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. But, Mary, [Indiscernible] and I like them all. I like the A220. I like the Embraer product. It was just -- it's kind of like going to a new car show. You just like all the different products that you see out there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : So just to follow up a little bit on those comments, Gary. At what point would you consider making any additions or changes to your fleet? I know you have about 250 or more MAX on order through 2026. When would it be reasonable to consider adding any other models and what might those be? Gary Kelly : Well, I'll be a little repetitive. We're not planning on adding a different aircraft fleet to -- aircraft type to our fleet, okay. So I'd just repeat that. We are not planning to do that. As a practical matter, we are -- we want to grow our airline and we will grow the airline over the next several years, Mike, at least with the Boeing MAX as a practical matter. So in order for us to add a different aircraft type, that would be work for us, and that's not work that would be completed in 12 months. I don't want to put a timeline on it because we're not working on it and I don't know how long it would take to do that. So hopefully, that at least gives you some parameters to think about. What we might be doing 10 years from now or 20, that's just not what we're talking about here today. But we have no intention of doing anything different in the near term whatsoever. And we're not preparing ourselves as if we have to do something different in the medium to long term either. That doesn't mean we won't change our minds. And there's -- as usual, there's all those caveats. So Mike really answered the question. We have the Airbus, the A220 is new, and we have an obligation to look at it and understand what it is. It is in our wheelhouse, so to speak. It's a narrow-body airplane that would be eligible for consideration to do the mission. That's what he's doing and nothing more. Operator : We'll take our last question from Ghim-Lay Yeo from Flightglobal. Ghim- Lay Yeo : I just had a question regarding the 737 retirement plan. I know, Gary, you said that you would like to avoid having to unwind the retirement plan for 2019. And I was just wondering if Southwest intends on doing any short-term leases of 737 NGs or just going out to the used marketplace? What are you seeing in the market in terms of pricing and availability, especially with the release on 737 flight capacity currently? Thank you. Gary Kelly : Well, it's a great question, and I think it's a short, easy answer. The answer is no, we are not contemplating going out into the used market. I think the only thing that would, Mike, make sense to me is if we wanted to add some NGs to the fleet is we would unwind some of the airplanes that we already own or lease. And again, we don't have a plan to do that. Tammy, I think you've got 18 retirements planned for 2019. Tammy Romo : For 2019. Gary Kelly : And Tammy mentioned that her plan at this point is to follow through with at least most of them. So there might be a couple of airplanes that we change our mind and decide to keep. But all of this is working under the assumption that the grounding -- that the airplane is ungrounded in the relatively near future and that way, we don't have to wrestle with that question. If it's grounded for an extended period of time, we'll have to develop a plan, quite frankly. And I don't think, Mike, that would include going out onto the used market. But to be honest with your question, we just -- we're not working on that scenario. And we just -- because we don't think it is a worthwhile effort, because we don't think it is a likely scenario. If that scenario materializes, I'm very confident that we can react to it and handle it, but it's nothing that we're working on. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. We've been out of the used market for the last couple of years. We've got most of the NG airplanes out there that we like. It just doesn't make a lot of practical sense for us to go out and search the market for a used or leased NG when we already have NGs on the property that are already in our maintenance program, already in our maintenance profile. It'd just be easier for us to extend that than it would be to go out and get a new airplane. So we're not looking out in the market at all for NGs. Gary Kelly : And the reason that we don't want to unwind the retirements, that would certainly be vastly easier compared to bringing another airplane on in the market, like Mike said. But he's already set a maintenance program for each one of these tail numbers and we would have to redo our maintenance plan to then add in maintenance under the assumption that we're keeping the aircraft longer. And that's the kind of work that I would -- I just don't want our tech ops department to have to add to their list. They have other things that I think are more important to work on. And we prefer to continue on with the retirement of those airplanes and bring on new airplanes to replace them. Ghim- Lay Yeo : Sure. And just, Gary, you mentioned that there has been no indication so far that there might be additional simulator training for the 737 MAX for when it becomes ungrounded. Is that just from what you gather from your discussions with Boeing and the FAA? Are you hearing anything from the union at all with regards to that? Gary Kelly : Correct. That's from all parties we've talked to. And certainly, I put great reliance on our pilots, on our flight operations leadership, our pilot union. And they are very confident in what we do as an airline, how we train. We just made a $250 million investment in our flight training facility, which is absolutely state-of-the-art and a huge source of pride here. And they are the litmus test for me and they are confident in the airplane, in the training, in the return to service with still some questions to be answered, admittedly. But if they were not, then I would not be. But the fact of the matter is they're very comfortable with the plan as we currently understand it. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Cody. If you all have any follow-up questions, as always, our communications team is standing by for you, our online newsroom at swamedia.com or by calling us at 214-792-4847. Thanks so much. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today's Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. My name is Greg, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Ryan Martinez : Thanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us today. We need to cover a few disclaimers before today's comments. First, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectation of [Technical Difficulty]. We'll also reference non-GAAP results, which exclude special items both in our earnings release. Also given the ongoing MAX groundings our current outlook is based on the most recent guidance from Boeing. That includes an assumption of regulatory approval of the MAX return to service during fourth quarter 2019. Any changes to these assumptions could result in additional adjustments to our flight schedule beyond January 5th, as well as further aircraft delivery delays and that could result in additional financial impacts. Please also check our IR website for more detailed information and disclosures. So we've got a great lineup of speakers today including Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; Tammy Romo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. And to kick us off, I will turn over the call to our Chairman and CEO, Gary Kelly. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan. And thanks everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. This year turned out to be quite a wild ride. We had some subplots earlier in the year, but the story is overwhelmed by the MAX grounding. The good news is we were exceptionally well prepared for the unexpected. We are healthier than ever and that's despite the body blow from the MAX, and we'll get through it, and we will get back on track. The frustrating thing since our last call is that the MAX grounding has extended much longer than we had anticipated. Of course that's no surprise now given that this news was revealed last month. Boeing won't have the latest software fix done until September. And in the meantime, we will be operating a great airline and produce very strong financial results all without any amounts from a Boeing settlement. Our people have done a heroic job, and I don't use that word lightly. And not only are they resilient, they're tough, they are brilliant, they are compassionate, and I want to thank them for a job well done. Our frontline employees have truly risen to the occasion dealing with 20,000 flight cancellations. But you don't hear a lot about our back office folks and we have numerous unsung heroes, so I want to sing for them. The frontline is at a hard time \u2013 they certainly have a hard time completing their mission without a plan. And our planners that, I'm going to have to rename re-planners have done an amazing job and I would lead that off with network planning, our operations planning, our financial planning groups, just to name a few. They have worked grueling hours, they have improvised, and they have really, really delivered. And I'm very proud of everybody. While the financial results are remarkably strong, strong margins, strong cash flow, revenues, and a really good cost performance, there's a lot of news in the press release. You're going to get a lot of excellent insights from Mike, Tom and Tammy, but I would like to point out just a few things. Number one, it's really all about the MAX. That's the only issue that we are dealing with and of course, it's helpful just to have one thing to be able to focus on. So everything else within the company is rock solid. Secondly, business is strong. Second quarter came in as expected. We had strong RASM. Third quarter is forecasted up 3% to 5%, which is right where it should be relative to second quarter. Thirdly, our cost management is solid. Taking into account the MAX and the out-of-service aircraft we are where we expect to be, if not better for the second third and \u2013 quarters and in the full year. We told you all at the beginning of the year that we were looking at flat CASM-Ex in the second half and that's where we think we will be taking again the MAX into account. Fourthly, Newark, any student of Southwest will quickly understand our approach here and this is a tactical decision forced by the MAX groundings and the painful cut of 8% of our capacity. As a little bit of background, we acquired 18 Newark slot pairs in 2010 and that was a consequence of the United Continental merger where they were required to divest some slots. So we did that deal in about 24 hours. At that time, we had virtually no presence at LaGuardia, and in fact had only been there for about a year. On the LaGuardia side of things in 2011, we acquired more slots at LaGuardia with our AirTran acquisition. In 2013, we acquired yet again more slots from the divestiture caused by the U.S. Airways and American merger. So we find ourselves with a significantly larger presence at LaGuardia than we had contemplated back in 2010 when we went into Newark. We also find ourselves in a magnificent facility, which is certainly significantly better than what we started with in 2009. So, we currently offer 37 daily departures from LaGuardia that will be as of October. New York is a huge market, but for us it is a destination market. Given our relatively small position at Newark and LaGuardia, and our inability to add any meaningful number of flights to these market, it makes sense for us to consolidate our New York City flying into one airport. LaGuardia is the choice for the vast majority of our New York City bound customers. And it's not out of character for us. We consolidated our operations in a couple of Ohio locations in 2017. We consolidated Flint Michigan into Detroit in 2018. And then with larger markets like Chicago, Houston, Dallas, we served one airport. Newark underperforms financially, and to offset our reduction in service there we'll be able to add seats at LaGuardia, and be more productive with a superior financial result. So that's what's happening with Newark. The other thing, I could add is that as to the timing, it's very straightforward. We need the airplanes. We can't afford in this highly competitive environment where our capacity overall is cut to have underperforming assets, which leads to my fifth point, which is Hawaii. We'll be resuming our expansion without having to wait on the MAX any further and as we described in the press release. Adding Hawaii and quickly becoming relevant is strategic for us, and this move better supports execution of that strategy. So to be clear, we aren't backing off of New York City with this move, but we are accelerating our growth in California and Hawaii. So those are the high points. And to kick us off with more details and better insights, I'm going to turn the call over to first, our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven. Mike Van de Ven : Well thanks, Gary. I want to start just by reiterating what Gary said about our people. They are indeed resilient and they make this company great by taking care of our customers, our operations and each other. And I am immensely thankful for their efforts. Well in an environment where we have 34 MAX aircraft out of service, our performance for the quarter, I believe was very good. Most importantly, we took very good care of our customers. First, we used all of our spare aircraft to cover any scheduled MAX flying through June 7. We then reaccommodated the remaining impacted customers to other flights where possible. So we ran an all-time quarterly record load factor of 86.4%. And we did that without any spare aircraft from April 1 to June 7. And just to state the obvious, spares are important. They protect against unexpected events like the unforecasted hail event we had in Denver on May 28. And that took 24 aircraft out of service for a period of up to two weeks in a time we were already without spares. So in that kind of environment, with no margin for recovery for any unexpected events like that, our people found a way to get 85% of our customers to their destinations within 30 minutes per scheduled arrival time. Through aircraft swaps, crew changes, extending the operating day just whatever it took. And just as a reminder, we schedule our operations with less block and turn time than any other carrier in the industry to begin with. We carried 99.5% of the checked bags on the flights they were checked on. We led all marketing carriers with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio and our Net Promoter Score was still industry-leading at about 59% for the quarter. Now all those numbers were down a bit from last year, but given the impacts of the MAX grounding to have our overall operations results still in the upper tier of the industry is really a testament to the people of Southwest Airlines. Going into the third quarter in the peak summer travel month, we are focused on continuing to improve all aspects of our operational liability. So we've operated with the appropriate spare levels beginning in June eight and we're going to carry that throughout the year. And we're already seeing improvements in the reliability of our service. So our on-time performance which was really the most significantly impacted item has rebounded nicely since adding back the spares. We finished the month of June fourth place in the industry with respect to marketing carriers and we expect to finish July either third or fourth. And of course, one of the carriers ahead of us is Hawaiian and they benefit by a larger percentage of their network being interisland service in Hawaii. So, in terms of delivering our product in a reliable and a hospitable manner, I'm very pleased with our performance thus far. Turning to the MAX. While the operational challenges are manageable, they do grow in complexity as the groundings extend. So Boeing, as Gary mentioned still has work, they must complete. The FAA must review and improve that work before granting regulatory approval of the return to MAX to service and we are in continued conversations with Boeing and the FAA. And as Ryan said earlier, we are dependent on them for a timeline to return the MAX to service. As we mentioned in the press release, we're in the process of removing all MAX aircraft from service through January 5. So, I'll walk you through a high level outline of our approach to reintroducing the MAX to our regularly scheduled service on January 6. Before I start with that just for context when the MAX grounding is lifted, we're going to have three groups of aircraft to address and each of them have a unique process. So first, we have a 34 aircraft, MAX aircraft that Southwest has in long-term storage in Victorville, California. Second, we're going to have a group of aircraft that Boeing is storing that have not yet been through the delivery process to Southwest Airlines. So we don't own those airplanes and they're not on our operating certificates. And then lastly, there will be aircraft coming from the Boeing production line after the grounding is lifted which we will want to except as delivered in the normal course of business. The first step in the process regardless of the grouping is instruction from the FAA as to the specific requirements that will be mandated to make the fleet operational. That will likely include software uploads and/or other technical requirements to the aircraft along with some required pilot training. Now we're going to assume that the pilot training requirements will not include additional simulator training. We have an agreed-upon 30-day time frame with our pilot union to complete the expected computer-based training and we plan to -- we plan to time the work to bring the aircraft back into the operational fleet to correspond to the end of our pilot training period, so that every pilot is prepared to fly every aircraft in the fleet. In addition to those mandated activities, there will be additional maintenance procedures to transition the aircraft from long-term storage into an operational readiness state. And at this point, we believe that those activities and approvals could take one to two months to complete for the Victorville aircraft and that we could intake up to three Boeing storage aircraft per week once they're ready to begin their storage deliveries. So as I mentioned, we plan to take production aircraft as they're available for delivery. Our delivery schedule with Boeing continues to evolve as their production and their schedules change. And we expect the majority of our 41 contracted deliveries for the remainder of this year which by the way would have been in the Boeing storage grouping and will likely be moving into 2020. Assuming regulatory approval to return the MAX to service by early November, our baseline plan will be to control the process, so we can provide the network at least 30 MAX aircraft to the operational fleet by January 6 schedule and then we would ramp from there in a controlled fashion depending on the delivery schedules. So that approach is intended to balance as best we can aircraft availability with customer demand in early 2020, then match the crew staffing to the aircraft availability. In terms of the pilot staffing, given the removal of the MAX line through January 5, we're going to defer our October pilot new hire class and the associated captain upgrade class until March or April next year. And so, while there is some cost savings in 2019 from deferring those classes, the primary driver was to better match flight crews with their flying needs to give them more productive schedules. In closing, I'm very proud of our people and our performance this quarter. And as it relates to the MAX, we have a plan to remove MAX flying for the remainder of the year. We have the detailed plans for the ungrounding of the fleet once that occurs. We have an idea of how we can resume taking deliveries from Boeing and we're ready to make adjustments to those plans if we need to. So, just as our people are doing this summer, we really want to be prepared to provide exceptional customer service to our customers for the holidays later this year. So, we remain focused on running a safe, reliable, and on time, and an enjoyable operation and I really think we've got the best team in the industry to do just that. And with that, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Nealon : Okay. Well, thanks Mike. Good morning -- or I guess good afternoon everybody. So, as Gary and Mike both said this has been a challenging quarter. But I think in spite of the issues we've had to deal with our results were very strong. We produced record passenger revenues, record operating revenues in the quarter, along with a record load factor of 86.4%, which I think by any measure is a pretty impressive set of results, especially considering what we're going through. I think what's equally impressive just to reemphasize what Mike said was simply the quality of the operation in spite of the MAX cancellations. Our on-time performance was strong, our customer satisfaction scores, our brand scores remain at the very top of the industry. I know that you guys hear this a lot and you may think it's a throwaway line, but these results truly are because of our people. Mike and Gary and I have spent a lot of time in the stations this past quarter. And I can tell you the morale is high and the focus of our people is very clear eyes on running a great operation and taking care of our customers. And you can see it in our metrics and you can see it and read it and here it in the feedback from our customers. It's pretty amazing. From a schedule perspective, we've been very focused on maintaining the strength of our network, albeit with significantly fewer aircraft than we've planned. Our network team, as Gary has already alluded to, has done an absolutely incredible job of adjusting and republishing our schedules. And our revenue management team has done an equally incredible job of managing the revenue environments. And there's no doubt that we're continuing to benefit the revenue management capabilities that were enabled by our new reservation system. Overall, I'm very pleased with our second quarter RASM result of 6.8% year-over-year growth which is right in line with the improved guidance that we provided in our June 19th Investor Update. And just as a reminder on the April 25th earnings call, we expected Q2 RASM to increase in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. And as you might recall, there were several key things that we entered in that original guidance. Just a quick summary of that. First, we were expecting an improvement in leisure demand trends as compared to the first quarter. We also had expectations of solid demand for both leisure and business travel and both of these held true throughout the second quarter and actually improved each month during the quarter. So, we're pleased with that. Second, we were expecting a strong yield environment, especially with close-in fares which we did in fact experience. And we actually saw a slight improvement in our base business as we progressed through the second quarter as supported by our system-wide fare increase in mid-May. Third, we are expecting a one point year-over-year RASM benefit from our reservation system which occurred as expected. Next we are expecting a one point year-over-year RASM benefit in the lower capacity due to the removal of MAX flights in the schedules. This action ended up being about two points. Fifth, we had three points of year-over-year tailwinds from second quarter 2018 items including Flight 1380 as well as last year's suboptimal flight schedule. And finally no surprise we had a half point year-over-year benefit in the Easter shift out of Q1. So, these six drivers net out for a 6.8% RASM growth for Q2 which again is a very strong performance, especially considering the challenges. Both our domestic and international businesses performed well in the quarter with international RASM performance being especially robust in particular in our Mexican beach markets. Obviously, Q2 was not without execution risk. Our network planning team has the challenge of removing MAX flying from Q2 and we had to manually work our way through March and republish our April and our June base schedules in such a way that best maintains the integrity of our network. Our revenue management team had to manage through a bit more due to grounding of the MAX which reduced our higher yielding inventory due to past -- passenger re-accommodations in particular with close-in inventory during April. But the impact also carried them through the first half of May. So, we had a lot of moving parts to manage to throughout the quarter and I think the commercial team's execution was simply extraordinary. They were incredibly focused and the result was that they were able to produce flight schedules that mitigated as much risk as possible. And these schedules work for our customers, but they also work for Southwest both operationally and commercially. Our ancillary products also performed very well in Q2 with other revenue being up 11% year-over-year. And we continue to have a lot of success with our EarlyBird variable pricing product which we implemented last fall and which was enabled by our new reservation system. We also launched a new business-oriented credit card last month as we planned which is targeted at our small to medium-sized business customers. And so far the early results are very, very strong. We had another extraordinarily strong performance from our Rapid Rewards program this past quarter. Our total loyalty program revenue grew 15% in the second quarter and we continue to have strong credit card acquisitions. And our credit card retention rates also continue to be very high. So, we're obviously very pleased with the performance of our Rapid Rewards program which by the way continues to be recognized most recently as program of the year by the Freddie Awards for Best Loyalty Card, Best Airline Redemption Building, and Best Customer Service. The economics of the program are very, very strong. The customer benefits are best-in-class and we see a tremendous number of opportunities to significantly grow the Rapid Rewards program going forward. So, that's it for Q2. So, let's talk about Q3. So, our third quarter business trends continue to be very strong as well. We continue to see healthy leisure and business travel demand across the booking curve and a positive year-over-year yield trend thus far. And we're expecting a strong Q3 RASM performance in the range of up 3% to 5%. And just as a reminder, the MAX aircraft are already on the schedule through the entire third quarter which means we don't have the same closed-in re-accommodation challenges we had coming into Q2. Our Q3 RASM outlook does have a one point benefit due to headwinds from Q3 2018, which is made up of 0.5 point from 1380 and 0.5 point again from our suboptimal schedule from last year. Similar to the second quarter, we are estimating a year-over-year RASM benefit in Q3 of about two points from the reduced capacity due to the MAX grounding and we expect a 0.5 year-over-year RASM benefit from our new reservation system. We are seeing a slight negative impact to Rapid Reward redemptions and ancillary revenue as a result of MAX-related flight cancellations, but we still expect another strong year-over-year performance of both categories. Turning to Hawaii, well I can tell you this, Hawaii is off to a fantastic start. And although we're early on in our expansion, our results so far are exceeding our expectations in every category. So, we're now up to 14 daily flights, six in California two Hawaii, and eight interisland round-trip flights. Demand for our service to Hawaii is very, very strong and our load factors are far exceeding our system average. Our Hawaii in-flight product and customer experience is performing extremely well with our Net Promoter Scores above our system average which as you know were also very high. Demand for our interisland service is also very strong and is made up of a very strong mix of local customers. And the brand and customer experience for us for the interisland service is actually above our total system performance which again leads the industry. And our fares are where we'd expect them to be at this point. It is fair to say that we're seeing the Southwest Effect in the markets that we're serving and this is obviously enabled by our low-cost structure. Now regarding the eventual transition of Hawaii flight to MAX, we're obviously very eager to realize the cost efficiencies. But we can fly the 800 NGs to Hawaii as long as we need to while the MAX is grounded. As we announced this morning we have more Hawaii service plan to go on sale soon, so we'll talk about that more later. Now looking forward, our commercial team will continue to be very proactive in managing any additional MAX flight cancellations and network adjustments through the end of the year. And as you'd expect, we'll continue to be very focused on our execution. And our 2019 RASM outlook continues to be year-over-year growth in excess of 3%. Now regarding the capacity impact to Q4 RASM, we'll be at a point where we are approaching a 75 MAX aircraft deficit by year-end and as such the estimated revenue penalty from second quarter grow sequentially into the third quarter and grows further in the fourth quarter. So, when combined with the normal seasonality in the peak versus off-peak nature of Q4 and the complexity of the holiday schedule, we simply still have work to do over the next month or so. So, it's too early for us to give any guidance or perspective on the impact to our fourth quarter RASM. But one of our priorities clearly is to protect holiday travel and minimize the impact for our customers. But as you know the schedule changes and the decisions get tougher as our fleet deficit grows. And finally, despite the challenges that we faced, the Southwest brand remains very strong. Our Net Promoter Scores are tremendous, and we remain at the very top of the industry in spite of our challenges. And we expect to continue to grow revenues, despite declining year-over-year capacity here in the near-term. And as with our Q2 results, our Q3 RASM outlook should also put us at or near the top of the industry. So with that update, I'll turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Tom and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I'd like to add my thanks to all of our terrific employees for their focus and hard work. Our people are simply the best, and they have proven that time and time again. Gary, Mike and Tom have outlined the challenges that we've been managing through with the MAX groundings and I will round out our remarks with some commentary on the MAX impact on our cost, fleet and capacity plans and our balance sheet and cash flow. Starting with cost. I'd like to commend our people for a great job at managing cost in a challenging quarter. Our second quarter nominal cost, excluding fuel and profit sharing, came in a little better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. On a unit basis, ex-fuel special items and profit sharing, our cost increased 10.9% year-over-year. The impact of the MAX groundings drove six points of this year-over-year increase with the remainder of the increase primarily related to planned increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance spend, and airport cost. Our second quarter CASM-Ex increase was favorable to the guidance we provided in our June investor update when we were expecting a year-over-year increase in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. Following our investor update, the combination of the grounded MAX aircraft and weather resulted in a lower completion factor than expected which drove ASMs down further. However, the incremental unit cost pressure was more than offset by lower-than-expected airport cost, shifting of advertising and maintenance expenses to future quarters, and solid cost controls. Turning to third quarter. The year-over-year unit cost pressure due to the MAX groundings continued. We started the year expecting about two points of inflation in CASM-Ex in third quarter 2019. We now expect seven points of the year-over-year CASM-Ex impact from the groundings in this quarter compared with the previously communicated three-point impact I mentioned on our April earnings call, when we had the MAX aircraft removed from our flight scheduled through August 5. When combined with about a one point increase in year-over-year CASM-Ex from cost shifting from first half 2019, we now expect our third quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 9% to 11% range year-over-year. Sans shifting and the MAX impact, our third quarter CASM-Ex is relatively in line with our cost plan at the beginning of the year. The good news is that we have gained some non-fuel cost offsets for third quarter, as our flight schedule changes were well in advance of our flight crew bidding process and we also had temporarily lowered landing fees. As Mike mentioned, we've also temporarily delayed some flight crew hiring. These offsets pale in comparison to the year-over-year unit cost penalty, but we are doing what we can to mitigate near-term pressure and we will continue to do so. Looking at the full year, our current guidance is based on MAX cancellations through January 5. The MAX groundings are driving an incremental six points to full year CASM-Ex year-over-year as we are six to seven points off our original capacity growth plan to grow 2019 ASMs nearly 5%. Therefore, we currently estimate annual 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 8% to 10% range year-over-year. As a reminder, our annual CASM-Ex increase also includes the previously communicated 0.5 point increase year-over-year from cost related to the ratified agreement with our mechanics and approximately $10 million of incremental maintenance expense for seven of our 737-700 aircraft that we have decided to keep instead of retire this year, which I'll cover in a moment. I won't spend too much time on fuel as the market held fairly steady through second quarter. Our second quarter economic fuel price was right around the mid-point of our most recent guidance at $2.13 per gallon which included hedging gains per gallon of $0.06 and premium expense per gallon of $0.05. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year, with about a 65% hedge in both third and fourth quarters. Our hedging premiums for this year remain at approximately $95 million or about $0.05 per gallon, and we have a 58% hedge position for 2020. So, we are well prepared. For third quarter 2019 based on market prices as of July 19 and given our current hedge, we expect our fuel price per gallon to fall in the $2.05 to $2.15 range. As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency has been significantly impacted by the MAX grounding. Second quarter ASMs per gallon declined 1.7% year-over-year and third quarter ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the 1% to 2% range. This decline highlights the fuel efficiency of the MAX which is about 14% better than the 737 NG fleet. Once the MAX returns to service, we expect to get back on track with our desired fuel efficiency gains. Turning to fleet and capacity. We have not taken delivery of any aircraft since the MAX groundings in mid-March and we didn't retire any aircraft this quarter. So we started and ended the quarter with 753 airplanes. We don't have an update to our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing at this point, which shows 41 remaining deliveries this year. But we expect the majority of these will shift to 2020. We have been working through the delivery delays with Boeing. Based on their guidance, we are currently assuming, we will get 16 aircraft deliveries during fourth quarter 2019 which includes seven leased aircraft. To help mitigate the impact of the delivery delays, we are postponing the retirement of seven of our own -700s. With this in mind, we now expect to retire 11 -700s this year versus original retirement plan of 18. Turning back to second quarter, our ASMs declined 3.6% year-over-year. For third quarter, given the absence of the MAX aircraft for the entire quarter, we expect capacity to be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. With the extension of the MAX cancellations through year-end, fourth quarter 2019 capacity is expected to be flat to down 1% year-over-year. So looking at our second half 2019 plans versus where we are now, the impact of the groundings is far greater in the back half of the year and, of course, that's a function of the growing number of MAX aircraft we had planned to have in our fleet. For full year 2019, we now estimate capacity to be down in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. And finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with very healthy cash and short-term investments of approximately $4 billion. We originally estimated our total 2019 CapEx spend would be in the $1.9 billion to $2 billion range, with approximately $1 billion in aircraft-related spend. Based on Boeing's most recent guidance for our remaining deliveries this year, we now expect total 2019 CapEx to be in the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range with aircraft-related CapEx to be in the $400 million to $500 million range. The $500 million to $600 million reduction in this year's aircraft CapEx will shift to 2020, assuming the deliveries delays are caught up next year. Despite the year-to-date operating income penalty of $225 million from the MAX groundings, $175 million of which was in the second quarter, we generated strong operating cash flows in the first half of the year of $2.1 billion, with free cash flow of $1.7 billion, allowing us to return $1.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees who are managing through all the challenges the MAX groundings have presented. I am tremendously pleased with our financial results this quarter. Despite the negative financial impacts and operational challenges from the MAX groundings and the 20,000 canceled flights, we still managed to produce strong margins and all-time high quarterly revenues, load factors and earnings per diluted share. Our pre-tax return on invested capital was a strong 23.4% even with a 1 to 2 point year-to-date penalty from the MAX grounding. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong, allowing us to continue to provide meaningful shareholder return. Our revenue production is strong and we continue to benefit significantly from our new revenue management system our Rapid Rewards program and ancillary revenues. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place in 2019 and beyond to mitigate fuel price pressure. While lower capacity is putting year-over-year pressure on our non-fuel unit costs, we remain diligent on controlling the cost we can. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect solid margins in 2019 at or near industry-leading FX, even with the MAX penalty, with the opportunity to continue delivering stellar returns on capital. We will get past our near-term challenges from the MAX groundings and our second quarter 2019 financial results demonstrate the strength of our low-cost business model, our network and our amazing people. With that, Greg, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Gary, I know you've got versions of this question on the last call, but just given everything that's going on with the MAX I thought it was important to ask again. I guess when does the risk tied to having a single fleet type offset the economics of that single fleet type? Gary Kelly : Andrew, yes, thanks for the question. It's something that we'll want to explore. There's no way to avoid risk with a fleet. Period. If we had one manufacturer that's 50% today and the other is 50%, 50% of our fleet being grounded would be a huge problem. So I don't have anything new to tell you today. We think that Boeing is a very strong company, a great partner and believe that the MAX 8 is the best airplane in its category. We haven't learned anything different in 90 days to change our view on that. I think the nuance of your question is something that we'll want to explore, because in the current scenario some of our competitors who do have a diversified fleet aren't having their growth plans impacted as drastically as we are. But the odds of having this unique scenario again and then executing a plan that's so narrowly focused on avoiding this, I don't -- right now, I just don't think that would be very wise. But the short answer is, right now, we don't see that we need a change in strategy. The longer answer is, I think, it's something that needs to be fully explored and debated and that's not something we're going to do in 90 days. As a practical matter, if we want to diversify the fleet, it would take us years. So absent going out and acquiring another carrier and operating a separate airline in that sense, there's just no easy way around that. Andrew Didora : Fair enough. Thank you for that color there, Gary. My second question maybe for Tammy. Just want to get your thoughts around IMO 2020 and your hedging policies. The 58% hedge in 2020 how much of that is just a WTI as compared to jet tracks and just curious to get your expectations for the potential impact of this regulation on jet fuel? Thanks. Tammy Romo : Yes \u2013 no, thanks for the question. We've been contemplating IMO 2020 for quite some time and that has certainly involved \u2013 informed our hedging strategy. We have about a 10% position in heating oil for 2020 and we have a combination of Brent and WTI. So we have a diversified portfolio, and we feel like we're positioned well should we see prices increase \u2013 or the crack spreads rather increase from current levels. And just in case you missed it in our earnings release, we have a 58% hedge for 2020. So, again very well hedged. Andrew Didora : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Tammy Romo : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Moving on, from Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Joseph DeNardi : Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, I'm wondering, if you can just talk about given the plan that Mike laid out for reintroducing the MAX how we should think about capacity growth and if you'd like to discuss that CASM-Ex kind of into next year just given all the moving pieces? Thank you. Gary Kelly : Mike has a lot of work to do, when you think about the variability in the Boeing delivery schedule from here. So all we can do at this point is put a stake in the ground make some assumptions. I think we've been clear what our assumptions are here for the near-term. I think when you then under the assumption that we hit those dates, Mike, where Boeing has done in September FAA signs off in October, and we begin taking deliveries I guess that would be sometime in December let's say. Right now, we're making assumptions as to how many airplanes we can physically un-ground ourselves, how many Boeing can physically unground and then how many Boeing can deliver. So there is three different sources of MAX 8s and there's always so many. We can do in a day or in a week. And we just don't know. We're in uncharted territory there. So I think that has some bearing. We've got a retirement plan for some number of Tammy MAX or rather a 737-700s planned for next year. We have some interest in either accelerating or decelerating the retirements. So we'll just have to see. At this point, I'll tell you our overarching goal is we want as many MAXes as we can practically deploy as soon as possible. And if we don't like the resulting capacity then I think we would then lean more heavily to perhaps accelerate some of the -700s. As we look at all of our route performance, and just market after market after market it is obvious that we're short capacity that we're spilling traffic and leaving money on the table and helping our competitors. And I will also tell you that that is not anything that we will leave unattended. So if there's a range of behavior that you would expect from us next year from never reckless from being aggressive, to being passive, I can assure you we're going to want to restore our operation and our system just as quickly as again we can safely and efficiently do that. But a lot of questions and right now its unproductive to try to give you any number about what that might be. My goal would be by the time we get to the end of next year to hope that we were back smoothly on our delivery schedule and our operation. And I think it's possible that we beat that by six months just depending on, whether \u2013 again whether we meet the current time frame and whether Boeing can deliver at the rate that we are assuming next year. Tammy Romo : And just to maybe jump in to help with what all this means for our 2020 cost, well the MAX groundings are obviously creating a material impact on our year-over-year ASM growth in CASM-Ex trends for 2019, and our long-term unit cost target is unchanged. Our unit cost goal excluding fuel and profit sharing is annual year-over-year growth below 2% as I discussed on last quarter's call. And I just do want to point out that this cost target includes our estimates for salary, wages and benefits, and increases for our people. We are experiencing pressure on our 2019 unit cost, due to the lower capacity as a result of the MAX groundings. And that's about again six points to the full year. And while this does create some near-term challenges for us, these pressures are one-time, and will pass. The year-over-year comparisons for next year obviously would be more favorable given this year's impact from the grounding. So in terms of just a target for next year, it would be to absolutely drive towards declining year-over-year CASM-Ex in 2020. Joseph DeNardi : That's very helpful. And then Gary, just another one for you, given your tenure at the airline can you just talk about over the last 25 years how the economics of your partnership with Chase have changed? What that means for helping the durability of your business over a cycle? And then, where your economics are now relative to the industry given that you most recently did the deal in 2015? And it's pretty clear that the economics have become more favorable for airlines over the past few years? Thank you. Gary Kelly : Yeah. So I'll give you a quick comment. And then Tom would love for you to opine on that topic. But just starting with 25 years, I think 25 years ago we didn't have an affinity card and saw that as a great opportunity. And so in the industry I don't know that I have as much of a perspective there. But certainly for us, yeah, we've come a long way in 25 years. When I started as CEO in 2004 we quickly concluded that the number one enhancement that we needed to make for the Southwest brand was to overhaul our frequent flyer program, and Tom covered a lot of material in his remarks, but I'll just cover it again. It is an award-winning industry-leading frequent flyer program and that is the foundation for the obviously driving the revenues. We have a great plan. Our customers love it. They take our credit card in droves and we obviously factor all of that into our economics. So we are far more stable I would say in terms of our revenue generation today than we were before. Then the new program was launched in 2011 very proud of that. That may be even the single biggest accomplishment that Southwest had over the last 10 years to 15 years. It was really, really significant. Tom, you want to -- anything you want to add on the economics? Obviously, we hold a lot of that very close to the vest, but it seems that\u2026 Tom Nealon : We do all the economics really close to vest. What I can tell you is just the growth of the program has continues to be incredible. It's just a massive growth engine for us. The retention, the customer affinity, the value of that customer is just so much greater than our non-card-holding customer. But we don't get into the economics of it. What I can tell you is we are really thrilled with the partnership. We're thrilled for a long time. We did as you know -- well not going to get into that either. But we are really thrilled with Chase. It's a good partnership. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for the time. I'm not sure who can answer this question. But when you talk about the pilot training and taking one to two months, do you have to put them through the simulator? Can you just sort of maybe address that? Mike Van de Ven : Hi, Helane. This is Mike. We're not expecting to have to put them through the simulator for the pilot training on the MAX. What we believe is that there needs to be an awareness of the MCAS system, how that works what it's doing in the airplane and that there can be -- my understanding is there can be sufficient computer-based training that shows the pilots of what is going on there. We have for x Southwest, we've been doing training with our pilots in terms of hand-flying the airplanes since kind of really the inception of the airline. And over the last two years we've introduced this training called the -- envelope training. And our pilots have been through scenarios where the airplanes are at the boundaries of their performance limits. And they've been in situations like the Ethiopian and Hawaiian Air incident and they've already been through simulator training for those kind of things. So this will be the second year that they've completed all of that. So when you bundle all that together that's why we think that the computer-based training coming out of this grounding is appropriate. And then we supplement that ongoing with the recurrent training in the simulator. Gary Kelly : Helane, the other thing that I would add which is really beyond your question, but it does -- it sort of explained the environment here. I think Southwest is the gold standard for the industry. We hire first officers that on average have 6,000 hours of flight experience. And in addition to that, we hire first officers that have captain experience. So you start with a very experienced cockpit crew. Then we obviously only fly the 737, we are the industry leader when it comes to training and operations and Mike covered our philosophy about flying the airplane and training for certain scenarios. So we'll be very well prepared to take on this new training requirement. Our pilots, I think -- more importantly our pilots are very comfortable and love the MAX and are looking forward to restoring it to service. And they'll play a key role obviously, when we communicate and when we're reintroducing the MAX to our customers. But we factored all of that into our plans. We're allowing more than ample time for the training and the reintroduction of the fleet. And I think as we were talking earlier, what is going to be as much of a challenge, if maybe not more of a challenge is just the maintenance and the reintroduction of all the airplanes back into service will be a task. And again, I think that Mike has allowed more than enough time for that with our January 5th target date. Helane Becker : Got you. And then can I just ask you one question about Newark, so I understand this? So this is not just a suspension of service. And when the MAX does come in you're going to go back? This is just leaving the market returning the slots? Gary Kelly : Those -- right now, it's not slotted anymore. It was when we acquired them in 2010. But the FAA whatever that term is they unslotted them several years ago. But no this is a decision where -- and that's why I like the word consolidate. So we'll have a significant New York City presence. It will be focused where our customers want to go which is LaGuardia. And we have -- actually with the new facility and the 800s and the MAX 8 we have an opportunity to grow our seat capacity there by I don't know 10%, 20% over time. So we have ample opportunity to do that, and we'll have a far more efficient cost-effective operation and revenue production by consolidating into one airport as opposed to having it diluted over two. So again, it's two still relatively small operations today that will consolidate into a much more efficient and arguably larger operation at LaGuardia. Helane Becker : That's very helpful. Thank you everybody. Thanks Gary. Operator : And next from JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Jamie Baker : Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Gary, I'm already kicking myself for asking this question last quarter because I'm basically going to ask it again today and probably will continue to do so for as long as the MAX remains grounded. Have you give any further thought to how long you can tolerate or would choose to tolerate year-on-year capacity declines before you potentially consider non-organic growth? You're clearly agitated by funneling profits and market share into your competitors' coffers. You've said as much today and I respect that. So I've got to imagine there's a breaking point out there somewhere. Gary Kelly : Does that mean, I get to kick you too? Just kidding. Jamie Baker : And right after you said that things about my employer for a change on the call. Gary Kelly : Again, I'm just trying to be pragmatic without being overly legalistic here with you. Obviously, we can't comment on anything like that in substance. I mean, I'm just trying to play the game a little bit. As a practical matter, we came into this in March with a view that this was a short-term problem. And one of the things that I think we've tried to emphasize or clarify here today is that we've got a strategy we're executing the strategy and this is really not affecting any of that. So all of that is a view that it\u2019s going to be ungrounded by the summer. And again it was disappointing to find yet another delay which essentially pushes it out to early next year. But all that we can handle and we can manage. So I think the tolerance -- and in fairness to your question the tolerance for this scenario goes well beyond that because then the nature of your question moves into a huge strategic question. Jamie Baker : Correct. Gary Kelly : And that -- so hopefully I made answer to your question. We're -- we can work our way through this. Obviously, the financial results that we've got right now are superb even in -- relative to our competitors it's actually incredible that we're -- that we compare so strongly and we'll get through this. We're going to end the year healthier than we started the year. And we've actually exercised a few new muscles here and there in really good shape. If we have to continue to manage a ragged schedule we're doing pretty well at that. So I just don't think that that's going to be an issue for us. Jamie Baker : Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate that. As a -- and just as a follow-on to that I mean, I have a real quick question for Tammy you talked about some soul-searching as to this whole fleet-type structure. Should we assume that Boeing competitors are circling you more aggressively in the current environment than they ordinarily do? Or is that not the case? Gary Kelly : That's always the case. And -- yes that's always the case. And again we've been open -- Mike has been looking at other airplanes and there's nothing. That's a duty we have. We want to know what's out there in the marketplace and we need to be comfortable that we've made the best decision for our company our shareholders our customers on and on and on. But -- so hopefully I answered that question. Jamie Baker : And then a quick follow-up or a quick housekeeping for Tammy. How should we think about the engine overhaul expense on the 700s that you're keeping? Just wondering if that will hit the P&L or if the plan is to run them down before you park them? I suppose MAX I mean might impact that calculus. And thank you both. It's been an exceptionally thorough conference call, best one this season. Tammy Romo : Well, thank you Jamie. And I don't want to kick you after that. So -- but we -- on your question on the maintenance expense there is about $10 million associated with pushing those seven aircraft and that's all contemplated in the guidance that we provided to you this morning. And that's going to hit fourth quarter as we pull\u2026. Jamie Baker : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Tammy Romo : Thank you. Operator : And next we have Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. So just this replanning challenge that you've been managing through in broad brush strokes you are going to grow mid-single digits in 4Q. By our math the MAX was more than 100% of that. The MAX was like 11 points of that growth. So ex-MAX your plan was actually to just shrink the fleet maybe shrink stage maybe shrink utilization. So can you just talk about how you practically unwind that? I assume in 4Q some of the aircraft were going away related to maintenance events that are due. Just in broad brush strokes how do you unwind that and minimize the schedule damage? Gary Kelly : Tammy, would you mind if I take a swing at that? You can clean it up. Is that okay? Tammy Romo : I do not mind at all. Gary Kelly : Well, we're in the middle of the sausage-making with that. I would say that as the -- if we were to take the MAX out of the schedule gross for the fourth quarter I believe that is close to 11%. So again as a reference point we're talking about a reduction in the second quarter because of the MAX of 7%, 8% in third quarter. So it goes up because we have more airplanes. Now the holiday schedules are really complicated because of the vast difference between a peak day and an off-peak day. And it's really complicated for our network planners. And they've really honed those schedules over the years and it's fully automated. And so this scenario blows all that up and they have to go back and now try to do it manually. We don't want to eliminate 10% to 11% of our capacity. And because of the off-peak days and the off-peak nature of some of the days there's an opportunity to add back some flying maybe fly the day longer and a few things like that where we could trim that back instead of being down 10% or 11% to something less. And until we figure out what that is I'd rather not give you a number. But we do have that choice. It won't be the greatest schedule. It might come with some RASM penalty because some of those flights won't be optimal for our customers. But we will do it with and without here. What's more productive from a profit perspective versus narrowly focusing on CASM or RASM independently and that's the way we're thinking about it. But I don't know if that's where you were coming from with your question. But you are correct that the fourth quarter is more complicated because of the number of different schedules and because I think Tom said we're looking for 75 airplanes at that point. And that's why as time goes by it gets more challenging for us. So having said all that no matter what we're still going to have a solid quarter. We'll have a solid profit. We will publish a schedule that we're proud of in the sense that Mike can operate it. It'll be well staffed et cetera, et cetera. It just won't be tuned and operated or optimized rather like it normally is. Tom? Tom Nealon : Well, yes. I just want to add to that. I think your -- part of your question was so how are you going unwind this not just financially but from the quality of the schedule perspective? I think that's how I interpret it. Obviously, when I get the customers we need to -- we're going to need to be in that kind of thing. But we weren't thinking about it as to -- and on to Gary's comments where we had to take a shorter-term view perhaps with some routes that have lower RASM performance as well as routes that are poor CASM performers. And the way we're working through it in our network team is just -- as Gary said, we haven't got through this manually. There's not a process to do this on this kind of scale. So we've had to pare back some of our long-haul routes that are underperforming against the average. There are also routes that were -- long-haul routes where there are alternative options. We can pare those back. And we're also reducing some of the international frequencies. So we're being very opportunistic. We happen to look at it line by line and that's how we're doing it. But it's about profitability. It's about getting our customers where they needed to be. But to Gary's point about the unsung heroes that's the network planning role right now and they are the heroes. That's what they're doing. So... Gary Kelly : Tammy anything you want to clean up there? Tammy Romo : No. I don't think there is much to add to all of that. All of that -- just in terms of what we're expecting for capacity just to maybe, put a bow around all of that. And again we're obviously still working through all of this as we sit here today. But we did give you our full year ASM guidance of down 1% to 2% year-over-year. So just backing into that it does imply exactly as you're coming up with there Duane that we'd be maybe down a little bit maybe down a point or so for our fourth quarter. But again a lot of moving parts and I will firm up any of that guidance as we go here. Duane Pfennigwerth : Great. Thanks for that generous answer. And then just real quick on the follow-up, really appreciate all the moving parts on 2020 outcomes and appreciate your commentary about that you want to make up, in any lost ground that you gave up this year. But based on your current knowledge of the approvals, based on your current knowledge of Boeing's ability to deliver, do you really think you'll end next year at that same shell count you expected to end 2020 before this MAX grounding? Gary Kelly : Well, based on what we know today, we're aware that six deliveries, Tammy would slip into 2021. So just trying to take your question literally here. And yes, it'll be less than what we thought. But I think - I'm fine with that. That's plenty close enough. And as everybody is aware, we're talking about putting a lot of airplanes into service next year. So if six slipped out of 2020 into 2021 from that perspective, that's fine as well. It's not going to make a huge difference. I think what's more in play again is, whether we want to try to accelerate some retirements. And there's just work to be done there and our teams do a tail-by-tail analysis to see what maintenance cost could be avoided and whether that's sensible and whether it really is profit-accretive to try to do that. There's just a lot that goes into that. Our staffing plan for next year looks really good Mike. So we haven't slowed our hiring such that we have a real snapback next year to catch up. So that's another I guess a fancy way of saying, we're a bit overstaffed. I don't think it's unproductive. But we have had to defer a couple of flight attendant and pilot classes as you pointed out earlier into next year. So all the way around, again, I think we're set up very well. We can manage this. We're getting good at it. So hopefully it will \u2013 hopefully, we'll hit the assumed timeline that we shared with you. And I think if that's the case, we'll be reasonably back in-line with where we should have been by midyear, if not earlier. So we could potentially recover quickly which will be very welcome. Tammy Romo : Yes. Just to add on to what Gary had said and we've talked about this a lot, we have tremendous flexibility in our fleet plan. So we'll work through this and obviously with the goal to produce financial results that we'll all be proud of and do it in a way that takes care of our customers. So we -- as Gary said, we're working through our retirement plan, but we've got a lot of flexibility there. And so we'll work through all that. And I think you'll be really proud of the results when it's all said and done. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you very much. Operator : All right. We have time for one more analyst question. We'll take that last question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Thanks for squeezing me in. Gary and Mike a question for you on the obvious with the MAX. Can you talk about the plan to make sure you get confidence from passengers in terms of flying the plane and how you're going to tackle that if you don't have the load factors and yields that are suffering in the first couple of months? And then relating to that, can you talk about any dialogue that you're having with the FAA? And any color about whether you sense urgency on their part to sort of move this along, given some of the pressures that you're obviously highlighting? Gary Kelly : Well, why don't I take them in reverse. And Tom if you want you can talk about the reintroduction. So -- and Mike can you help me out here on the FAA? Well, yes the answer on the FAA is yes. We have daily dialogue with the FAA. And I think that the FAA is -- well these are Gary's words. I believe that the work of Boeing on MCAS is done and I believe that the FAA is signed off on it. Although they are -- they will clearly tell you that they're not going to sign off on the MAX 8 until it is \"all done\u201d. But I think the MCAS component is done. I'll be shocked, if we learn anything different on that and I'd be disappointed to learn anything different. But I don't sense that the FAA is at all motivated to extend this grounding. I think they want to make sure that everything is covered, and they are doing their job quite frankly. This other thing came up, and it is such a remote chance that anything would go wrong. But in this environment, no one wants that remote chance. So Boeing readily agreed with that. And we're fine with that as well, by the way. It's -- I wished we had known it sooner, so it could have been worked on sooner. And I will admit to those thoughts. But no, I think it's all set up very well. And so unless we learn something new, it feels like our assumed time line is a reasonable one. Anything you want to add there, Mike? Mike Van de Ven : No, I think that's right. I think the FAA is just better focused on a high-quality review dotting their Is, crossing their Ts, making sure that they've addressed any type of unknown risk out there. And once they're comfortable with that, they will issue the guidance to go forward. Gary Kelly : Tom, you want to talk about the reintroduction? Tom Nealon : Yeah. I think -- so I think Rajeev, there's just so much media on the topic. I think it's going to increase as the aircraft begins to be reintroduced to service, and I think there are certainly going to be some people, who book away from the MAX for some period of time. I think it's going to be the less than we might expect, maybe shorter duration than we expect. And I think we've done a pretty good job honestly of understanding where not just our customer, but even non-Southwest customers' heads are at with respect to the MAX aircraft and their intent to fly in all of those kind of things. And what's really interesting is our customers -- so there's different ways to break all this to vapour. We're spending a lot of time actually with cohort customers. And our customers' perception of Southwest has not changed one iota, not at all in terms of their intent to fly, their trust in Southwest, the confidence they have in Southwest, et cetera, et cetera. So, obviously based all that, we're working through a very robust -- part of our return-to-service plan if you will. I mean there's a big piece for Mike in the operational side. There's a big piece for the commercial side, and there's a big piece for marketing and communication in terms of how we want to communicate. And we're going through that. It's going to be a very robust plan. I think one of the questions that's -- I've been asked several times is what if a customer doesn't want to fly, are you going to be flexible? And obviously, yeah, we're going to be flexible if the customer has an issue flying on a MAX initially. And to be honest with you, we have customers change flights all the time, so it's not a big change for us. In fact, I'm not sure what percent, but a massive percent of our itinerary has changed. So that's not a big deal for us. I think that we're just going to have to be flexible for a while as our customers get comfortable, and those that aren't. But we're very aware of it. We're thinking through it all, and I feel pretty confident where we are. Gary Kelly : Yeah. And I do too. And we're going to have to have a communications campaign. We're good at that. And just know that our pilots will play a key role in this communication. They're the ones obviously that have to be comfortable, and they're the ones that are credible. So, nobody in this company and especially our pilots is going to do anything that they deem to be unsafe. So then it's just a matter of convincing our constituents of that, and we're going to work hard to do that. Rajeev Lalwani : I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Ryan Martinez : All right. Well, that does it for the analyst portion of the call. Thank you guys for joining us. And of course if you have follow-ups just give me a ring. Operator : All right. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Laurie Barnett, Managing Director of Communications and Outreach. Laurie Barnett : Thank you, Greg. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. And before we begin taking questions, Greg, would you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for a question? Operator : Of course, Ma\u2019am. [Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen thank you for waiting. We'll take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. Thanks for calling on me. I just had two really quick questions. The first is Gary, in your earlier remarks you mentioned 20,000 cancellations. Are those all MAX cancellations? And over what time frame did those occur? Gary Kelly : Mike, that was total. I think normally you'd have 3,000 cancellations. So to put it into perspective -- but I would attribute the vast majority of that excess to the MAX. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Mary, when we talk about the 20,000 cancellations, they really come into two forums, with the schedule out there to sell the MAX and we have change the schedule. So before we operated that schedule, we pulled a lot of flights. I don't know flights we pulled out we included in that 20,000 cancellation number. And secondly, once we did operate the schedule, because we were so close into the booking curve and trying to re-accommodate as many customers as we could, we operated April and May without any spare aircraft, which I would attribute to the MAX. Gary Kelly : Right. Mike Van de Ven : And so, as you have weather events or unexpected maintenance events or hailstorms or other things like that, we just had no way to recover the airplanes and that drove the cancellations up also. So as Gary said, that was around 12,000, 11,000 \u2013 12,000 cancellations for the quarter just in the operations. And those numbers are normally under 3,000. So the vast majority of that 20,000 cancellation number is MAX-related. Mary Schlangenstein : And that 20,000 is just for the second quarter? Mike Van de Ven : That's right. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. Okay. My other question real quick was on the Newark gates. What happens to those? Are you able to sublease those gates to somebody else? Gary Kelly : It's a month-to-month lease, so no. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. And are you re-leasing them from United? Gary Kelly : I don't know. I don't think so. But it's -- No. No. It has to be -- yeah, it's with month-to-month and with the Port Authority. So\u2026 Mary Schlangenstein : With the -- okay, great. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Next from The Wall Street Journal, we have Alison Sider. Alison Sider : Hi everyone. Gary Kelly : Hi. Alison Sider : My question is do you think -- do you feel that -- hi -- do you feel like Boeing misled or provided any incomplete information at Southwest about the MAX either about the -- disagree or it's about MCAS more broadly or about whether it was safe to fly after Lion Air or really anything else? Gary Kelly : Well, I don't think there was any malintent at all. I think Alison, obviously, in hindsight, we wish that this never happened. We wish that all the things that are being done now were done then. And all the knowledge that we have now, yeah, we wish we had it then. So there were judgments made about the remoteness of the risk and I think that's why Boeing behaved the way they did. Alison Sider : Got it. So you don't from your perspective see that there was anything criminal that happened? Gary Kelly : No. No. Now -- and again I get asked about Boeing a lot. Boeing is a great company and Boeing is important to not just Southwest but our country. And they have a problem. They recognize the problem and I'm very confident they're focused on addressing the problem and taking care of their customers. So it's a tough situation and I have no doubt that mistakes have been made. Some are harder for us to evaluate than others. But my focus at this point is to get the problem solved, get the MAX restored to service, have Boeing do its job in terms of establishing confidence with customers as in the flying public. And, obviously, we just need to be comfortable that all the issues that have been raised have been adequately addressed. And I think that's where with what Mike was covering earlier we all want to see what the airworthiness directive provides for. We'll want to go through the training and we'll want to validate for ourselves that it all works as intended. So -- but no they're a great company. They're great people to work with. This is a terrible situation and I hate that they're in it. And, obviously, there are many of us that have been affected not just Southwest. There are a lot of people that have been affected here. So we just -- we need to keep our eye on the ball and solve the problem and move forward. Alison Sider : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next we have Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, good afternoon. You've said that you expect some of your MAX deliveries to slip into 2020. How confident are you that you will receive those planes when you need them given that planes are stacking up at Boeing facilities? And can you tell us a little bit more about the technical kits that Boeing is preparing to help that delivery process? Gary Kelly : Mike, I'll let you talk on the latter. Well, we're sort of in a range of we're not confident to we're 100% confident. I don't know where to put a percentage on it. But no there's no way we could be 100% confident that we're going to hit our assumed time line. And this is new territory for Boeing to unground airplanes so we're not quite sure of that. Then we've got -- we have to support that with our own resources and so does the FAA. So, yeah, all that has to be estimated at this point and with a view towards we're going to have to be flexible. So we'll learn as we go I'm sure and I would assume that we'll get better at it as we start ungrounding the airplanes and that maybe it will accelerate. But no I mean there's \u2013 yeah, there's a lot of uncertainties surrounding exactly what that will look like when it starts. Michael Van de Ven : Yeah. So Tracy this is Mike. We have 41 airplanes on a delivery schedule to take in 2019. And just my preference is -- and so if they made all those airplanes and they put them in a Boeing storage facility that just increases a pile of 700-ish airplanes out there. And to get those out of storage we have -- we're part of the bigger economy. So it makes sense to us to have some of those airplanes rescheduled into 2020 where we can take them right off of production line in a normal course of business. That would give us more certainty and less complexity. As to the airplanes that are coming out of storage what I understand is that most of the fixes at least at this point are software upgrades to the airplane. So there will be a service bulletin that will come out from Boeing that the FAA will mandate as an airworthiness directive. And then we will take that requirement and we will perform hopefully a software upgrade to the airplane. That is not complicated to do. There might be other work that we may need to do. And if we will we will do those things also. And then as I mentioned earlier there's a second piece in terms of the airworthiness directive, which will be associated with pilot training. And so long as it is -- does not require simulator time, we will get our pilots through that training in 30 days. Tracy Rucinski : Okay, thanks. So the technical kits, are those related to the software upgrade? Michael Van de Ven : I'm not for sure what the technical kits are right now because I don't know what the final fix is going to be for the airplane. Gary Kelly : But at least my interpretation of your question is what Mike is describing as a software is the technical package. So I don't know what else -- I'm with Mike. I don't know what else it would be. So all we know\u2026 Tracy Rucinski : Okay. Mike Van de Ven : So all we know is that we're going to update the MCAS software and then the software this piece of firmware in the flight control system. And then, the only thing I want to make -- yeah I don't know if you heard our earlier analyst call. But the simulator training, we don't feel is necessary because our pilots are extensively trained in the simulator, and for the kinds of scenarios that this software is being modified for. So, there will be training, but we think that it can be done on a computer-based approach. And that's what the FAA seems to be leaning towards anyway. But we're comfortable with that. Operator : Next from the Associated Press, we have David Koenig. David Koenig : Hi. This is really quick for Gary. Just to clarify, I think it was the last question on the analyst portion, that FAA you said that FAA is reviewing MCAS and signed off on it. And all that got left to check is that issue that came up last month. I wasn't clear did you hear that from Boeing? Or did you hear that from the FAA? Gary Kelly : And David that's not exactly what I said. So, those \u2026 David Koenig : Okay. Gary Kelly : \u2026were Gary's words. That's not the FAA telling --they in fact will not tell us, whether they have quality \u2026 David Koenig : Yeah. Gary Kelly : \u2026\"signed off\" on MCAS, because they want it all comprehensively together and I don't blame them. I think all I was saying is that, based on the status reports that we've gotten from Boeing and from the FAA on where they stand. I don't think that there is any more work to be done by either the Boeing or the FAA on that piece. I'm not speaking for them. I'm just telling you that we're not getting any sense that there's any more continuing on those functions by either Boeing or the FAA. What is still now in suspense is Boeing has gone off to work on this second issue. And until they get that done, we're all sitting here waiting for that construction to be completed. And then, I suppose they'll show it to us and they'll show it to the FAA and we'll know more. But I'm not expecting any activity on that with us until September. David Koenig : Okay. All right, so you don't want to explain where you got that sense but that that's your reading of the situation? Gary Kelly : Well I thought I did yeah. But based on\u2026 David Koenig : Okay. Gary Kelly : \u2026 the discussions that we've had with Boeing\u2026 David Koenig : Okay. All right. Gary Kelly : \u2026 and the FAA they've implied that if you will. David Koenig : Okay. Gary Kelly : So -- but they're -- but I've asked them if they would separate it. And they told me \"We will not.\" So, I want to be -- I hopefully made that clear. No. They won't tell us officially that they have signed off. And like I said, I don't blame them. They want to get the rest of it done and see it all together and make sure all those systems work as planned. But the good news is it's our sense that all of that work is in fact done and we're just waiting on the second piece. David Koenig : Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. Operator : All right and we have time for one more question. And we'll take that final question from Allison Schaefers with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Allison Schaefers : Hello, all of you? Gary Kelly : Hello. Mike Van de Ven : Hello. Allison Schaefers : I just wanted to see if you could be a little bit more specific about when you anticipate selling flights for Southwest Hawaii service for previously announced San Diego or Sacramento, Lihue and Hilo routes? And is actual service on those as expected to start this year or not likely end of 2020 based on the ramp up time needed? Gary Kelly : Well I should try I guess to disclose our schedule intent. I think I'm not going to do that today. Mike Van de Ven : But thank you for ... Gary Kelly : But we're really excited and we're very -- we're really making some announcements soon. And I will tell you that all the things we said previously, we still mean right? So, we still intend to serve Hawaii from Sacramento and San Diego and we still intend to serve Kona and Lihue. And we still intend to have interisland between Hilo and the other islands. So, everything we said is still spot on. So, we just have a little more work to do still and we're working on our schedules right now. We're not ready to announce it. But we can't wait to begin those flights as well. So -- and I'll tell you the reception we've had from the local communities has been phenomenal. And we could not be more excited as you heard from our very robust aloha when you said that. So thanks. Allison Schaefers : Okay. Any way you can elaborate a little bit with some specifics on the demand that you've seen for Hawaii? Gary Kelly : Well, I don't have any at my fingertips. I don't have any specific demand numbers. What I can tell you is that, as I said in my comments earlier, the load factors are significantly higher than what we're experiencing across the system. And keep in mind we just announced record load factors for the entire company and our Hawaii business is surpassing that. In terms of actual demand I kind of think about it in terms of load and it's just phenomenal. And that's a true for interisland as well as for the California to the islands routes. So, as I said, we have six mainland, California to the islands and we have eight round trips and it's just -- it's going phenomenally. It really is. So... Allison Schaefers : Okay, thank you, gentlemen. Gary Kelly : Thank you. Mike Van de Ven : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Barnett for any additional or closing remarks. Laurie Barnett : Thank you. If you all have any other questions our communications group is standing by to assist at 214-792-4847. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thanks, Chad. Thank you all for joining us today. Joining me on the call we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. A few quick notes. We will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations of future performance, which could differ from actual results and we will make reference to 2019 results to compare to prior year non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. We have more information regarding forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP results in our earnings release from this morning. Also, given the ongoing MAX groundings, just a reminder, that the timelines and current estimations we are sharing today regarding the MAX are based on Boeing's targeted regulatory approval of MAX return to service in fourth quarter 2019. Any changes to current estimations could result in additional adjustments to our flight schedule beyond February 8th, as well as further aircraft delivery delays and additional financial damages. With that, Gary, Mike, Tom and Tammy will provide updates before we open it up for Q&A. So I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thanks Ryan. And thank you all for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. All around, it was an outstanding performance and I am prouder than ever of our people. We told you last quarter, we were going to adjust to the MAX and operate a great airline and our people did just that. Our customer feedback reflects that. It was just a great performance in terms of reliability and hospitality. So I'm very, very proud and very thankful for our people. We also told you, we would adjust for the MAX and produced satisfactory financial results and I think we under promised. These results are stellar, strong revenues, better cost performance, record earnings, EPS was up 13.9% and even without the $31 million tax benefit EPS would have been up over 9%. And of course, our EPS would have been up over 43% were it not for the MAX grounding. Our operations frontline employees have delivered exceptionally well. I'm going to also give another special shout out to our planners or, as I've termed them last time, our replanners who continue to toil through ever changing scenarios and that is network planning, operations planning, financial planning, just to name a few. They continue to work very long hours and produce amazing results that's just truly heroic. I talk a lot about the importance of being prepared for the unexpected as Herb taught me and really all of us to do. And we talk about the importance of low cost, ample cash, low debt levels, sensible growth, sensible capital commitments, but we can never talk too much about the importance of having great and talented employees and a very strong culture. And of course, an element of that culture, we call the warrior spirit and their resilience. So we are truly blessed to have such great people. I want to talk about what's next. In addition to continuing to run a superb airline operation and deliver solid financial results, we want to do a couple of things. We want to conclude our discussions with the Boeing Company regarding compensation for the MAX related damages. And secondly, we want to safely and methodically return the MAX to service. And regarding the timeline of that, the FAA has revealed this week that they received the final software and related system documentation for the MAX from Boeing and they are in the process of certifying the changes with the certification flight weeks away. While the FAA has been very clear and very careful not to commit to a date, working with Boeing we've assumed an ungrounding date of around mid-December and that translates to a MAX in-service date for us of February the 8th in terms of our flight schedule. So, along the way, between now and mid-December if we judge that that date won't be met, we'll roll our schedule yet again. So recall that our second quarter assumption was that Boeing delivered by the end of September, so we're about three to four weeks behind that, which is why we've moved from what was the January 6th date to February the 8th. So the closer we get the more confident I am. However, I'm still not highly confident about mid-December. I think Ryan's already made that clear. But what's important of course is that we give the FAA the time that they need to do their job, which I know they will. And, of course, we're here to support them every way that we can. Our plans and our outlook for the fourth quarter are very solid. We've got a schedule that's stable, if not optimal. Travel demand continues to be strong. Fuel prices are remarkably stable and moderate and our cost outlook for everything else is below our original plan. So we've given you the guidepost for fourth quarter in the press release and the key to understand here is that, we had to redo what turns out to be nine complex schedules that make up the fourth quarter and they're complex because of the way variability caused by the holidays. And we simply didn't have time to redo nine schedules. So we did one, or in essence one, and that results and less peak flying than we would otherwise like, because we didn't have enough airplanes and it translates into more non-peak flying than we would like. So time has gone by since we've done that. Bookings look pretty darn good for the fourth quarter and we're more bullish that RASM will be up during the quarter and we've provided that guidance and maybe as much as 2%. And that's on capacity that is down just slightly versus a year ago. Regarding next year, we are redoing our plan yet again, as we speak. I don't have a capacity forecast for you for the obvious reason, other than to say I can't imagine that it will be double-digit growth compared to 2019. And I would also say that more than likely whatever you guessed it would be based on our July discussions. It's going to be less than that, because the return to service schedule has pushed out. So our 2020 market priorities will continue to be Hawaii, which is going extremely well and based on what we published so far, we'll have an emphasis on Denver, Baltimore and Houston. And obviously, looking forward to having the MAX back so we can restore a lot of depth that is currently missing in a lot of our markets. So Mike, Tom and Tammy as always are going to elaborate further those are the highlights. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven to kick this off. Mike? Mike Van de Ven : Well, thanks Gary, and good morning, everyone. I spend a lot of time talking about the importance of teamwork and especially in our industry where our customers are completely dependent on our people to take good care of them and our people do take a lot of pride in that. They jump through all kinds of routes taking care of our customers in light of the MAX groundings throughout the second quarter. And it wasn't until June which finally had the MAX out of the schedule and a sufficient number of spare aircraft incorporated into the network. So the third quarter was really the first clean quarter without having to scramble operationally due to the MAX impacts. As I mentioned in our second quarter call, it was important for us going into the third quarter to deliver the operational reliability, hospitality and efficiency that our customers have come to expect from Southwest. And you know our people were just magnificent. They delivered the best overall operation that Southwest has produced in at least a decade. Our on-time performance for the quarter was 83.4% that's the best since 2011. We carried 30.5 million bags in the quarter and 99.6% of those were handled just as they were checked and that's the best performance in our history. Our customers certainly noticed all of that. Two out of three of them were net promoters of Southwest based on our survey results. That's the highest it's been in five years. And again, we believe the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio as measured by complaints of the BOT and we're also leading year-to-date in that measure. So overall an exceptional operational performance and we accomplish those results with the lowest amount of aircraft time invested in blocks and turns in the industry. With respect to our turns, we had a heavy focus in the third quarter on rolling out bag scanning technology. We introduced the scanners and we trained 10,000 plus ramp agents in all of our domestic locations over a five-month period and that effort ended September 30th. So that's a foundational investment that's going to help us track our bags with more accuracy provide more customer service, automated aspects of the weight balance process and move toward a paperless turn. So we expect this kind of operation reliability to continue. And at this point in October our on-time performance and a bag handling is shaping up again to be the best in years. The operation is solid and our biggest unknown at this point is the MAX return to service timing. As Gary mentioned as you all know we've pulled MAX related flying from our schedules through February 8th. We had previously planned for an early November return to fly and our expectation to split at least a month. And as Gary mentioned Boeing did confirmed -- reaffirmed yesterday that their target was to return the MAX to service in the fourth quarter. And we are in continued conversations with Boeing and the FAA as they complete their various milestones in the process and we'll get a clear picture of when the aircraft may be cleared to fly. If we don't have certainty of the mid December return to service, we will likely need to push our cancellations out further. So once the aircraft are cleared to fly our process to get them back in the service the same as I reported last quarter. It will take 30 to 40 days from the issuance of the airworthiness directive to get our manuals updated, FAA approval and our pilots trained.  Our assumptions at this point is that the pilot training will be computer-based training and we will not require simulator time. We will be coordinating work necessary to bring the aircraft back into the operational fleet to correspond to the end of that pilot training period. So Boeing owes us 41 aircraft that we contracted for 2019 that have yet to be delivered. And we add that to the 34 own MAXs and that gives us 75 aircraft of backlog to ingest into the fleet when the grounding is lifted. We believe that we can manage that at a rate of about 5 to 10 airplanes per week which if you do the math implied to two to four months before all of our 2019 and prior MAX aircraft are back into operational service. As Gary mentioned our main objective in relaunching the MAX is to do it with a high degree of certainty and confidence. It's critical that the schedule and the aircraft availability come together so we avoid the unexpected customer disruptions that we had early in the year.  So in closing, I am so grateful to all of our employees. They are the heartbeat of Southwest Airlines. They are the best. The operational results for the third quarter were superb our plans to return the MAX to service are well thought out. They are embedded and are coordinated across all of our operating teams. And our focus remains on running a safe, reliable, hospitable and efficient operation. And I think we've got the best team in the industry to do it. So with that Tom, over to you. Tom Nealon : Okay. Well thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start -- I'm going to pick up right where Mike left off. I also want to echo what Gary and Mike said we just had tremendous third quarter operationally absolutely rock solid. The service and hospitality was incredible. We're the very top of the industry in terms of our service and we deliver great financial results. And I really do believe as Mike and Gary said this is absolutely because we have incredible people. They are just so committed toward Southwest Airlines stands for. So I want to thank each of you for the great performance. So with that let me just jump right into the third quarter. Our RASM growth of 4.2% year-over-year was in line with the guidance we gave on our July earnings call and reaffirmed back in September. Throughout the quarter we saw continued strength in passenger demand trends both leisure and business travel were strong and we continue to see strong year-over-year passenger yields. We are obviously significantly impacted by the removal of the MAX from our schedules and the result was our capacity declined 2.9% in the quarter. We had an awful lot of moving parts. We made a lot of schedule changes But we did have to make some choices around the timing of network investments on a market by market basis. But even with the MAX challenge, we generated record third quarter passenger revenues and record operating revenues as well as record RASM performance. Our commercial team did an absolutely incredible job of minimizing a good portion of the MAX impact. And as expected we experienced roughly two points of temporary year-over-year RASM benefit for Q3 comparing us our original plan before the MAX grounding. We also had a 0.5 point year-over-year RASM benefit from our new res system and revenue management tools as expected. And we also had a 0.5 point year-over-year RASM tailwind from 2018 sub-optimal schedule as well as 0.5 point tailwind from Flight 1380. Our other revenues increased 8.6% year-over-year for the quarter. This is primarily due to the continued strong performance of our Rapid Rewards program. And on a year-to-date basis our other revenue is growing at 11.4%. So we're continuing to see strong growth in spending on our co-brand credit cards. I think this is really being driven by two things. First our customers tend to keep our credit card top of mind and top of wallet. And I really see this as a function of the real value that our customers get from the program. So they tend to use our card as a primary credit card which is very important. Second we're seeing new credit card acquisition growth rates in the double-digits on a year-over-year basis. And the acquisition growth rates on our business co-brand cards are even higher. So we're seeing tremendous growth in the size of our credit card portfolio. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform very well and we are very pleased with the structure and the economics of our program as well as with our Chase relationship. The beauty of the program is simplicity and the value that it brings to our customers. No seat restrictions. No blackout dates. It's easy to earn, its easy to redeem points. So there is really value to our customers and they love it which is why it\u2019s an award winning program year after year after year. So our loyalty program is kicking all cylinders and we couldn't be -- we're happy with where we are. My last point on Q3 as I'm sure most of you have seen by now, we did announce in early August our plan to expand into the global distribution systems or GDSs with new agreements with Travelport and Amadeus. And we will have the highest level of GDS participation with industry standard capabilities which will make it easier for travel management companies and corporate travel managers to do business with Southwest. And this opens up a whole new pool of corporate customers that we haven't had access to our current distribution platforms. And I also think it's important to note that the vast majority of domestic business travel is booked as coach travel which we happened to be pretty good at. Our product has a lot of distinct advantages the business travelers, corporate travel managers truly value such as low fares, a strong network with high frequencies, roughly 75% of our customers fly non-stop, no fees for changes to itineraries which by the way that's a big deal for business travelers, its been a lot of money and no bank fees a great loyalty program and so on and so on. So we have a great product for the business traveler. But the GDS channel is a channel where we've never truly competed. But as you'd expect, once we did go live in this channel we intend to compete very hard to win the business traveler. We are targeting to have our GDS capabilities up and running by mid 2020 and we expect initial ramp-up will contribute $10 million to $20 million of EBIT contribution for the second half of 2020. The initial revenue impact is very modest. We also know there's a big opportunity to grow this piece of our business substantially over the next several years. So we're building out our technology literally as I speak. And we're also well into the build out of our Southwest business sales team and our business to business service capabilities. So at the end of the day, Southwest will have strength in three business to business distribution channels; first, self service through our new SWABIZ platform, which is largely targeted at small and medium companies. Second, direct connect distribution through the ATP co-exchange platform. And third, our full function GDS capabilities which go will live as I said in mid 2020. So a lot to come out on this, we will talk about this more going forward. So that's it for Q3. Let's jump in to Q4. So for me flight schedule perspective, we've been very focused on maintaining the integrity and the strength of our network and spite of the fact that we have significantly fewer aircraft than originally planned. And that phrase is not just a throwaway phrase. When I say we want to maintain the integrity and strength of our network what it means is, we want to maintain the depth and frequency of service in key markets. It means we want to maintain our high degree of point to point direct flying. It also means we want to maintain our high quality connecting itineraries. And I think our network planning team as Gary alluded to has just done an incredible job of adjusting and republishing -- and republishing our schedules multiple times. And to a very large extent, they've done just that. They maintain the integrity and strength of our network throughout the process. Same can be said for our revenue management team, they've done an equally incredible job managing the revenue environment. In the second and third quarters they were successful in offsetting the yield dilution of the MAX related rebooking of customers. Now in terms of the removal of MAX flights in the fourth quarter we've had our work cut out for us. We'll have a 68 aircraft deficit by year-end which is double the number of MAX aircraft were grounded in mid-March. And as you know Q4 always has most complex set of schedule simply because of the seasonality and the peak versus off-peak nature of the quarter. Our working assumption as we are building these schedules months ago was that -- the MAXs have been back in service for all the fourth quarter. So that was our base assumption and based on that we published 9 separate flight schedules covering the November and December timeframes. And these are very well optimized for the holiday and non-holiday time periods. The reality of today versus our base schedule assumptions are quite different and the result is that our flight schedule adjustments in Q4 are very unique set of challenges in comparison to what we were solving to in Q2 and Q3. So we're now solving to a deficit of 68 aircraft in a highly seasonal period. Most practical approach for us was to revise our public schedules in such a way as to smooth our flying during the fourth quarter versus our original plan of optimizing around quick peaks and troughs. The net effect is, you will have less flying and what's optimal during peak and has to do lack of aircraft and more flying what's optimal during the non-peak periods, simply to ensure the connectivity between the flight schedules. This isn't ideal and it's certainly not an optimized schedule, but it does satisfy the three important criteria that we centralized a team; and those are, first we wanted to minimize any disruption to our customers during the holiday travel. Second we can assure that we had a schedule that was operationally feasible as efficient as possible. And third we wanted to meet or to contain and minimize the impact on operating income. So again this isn't optimal. We have been able to achieve these objectives, maintain the quality of our product and our operation, while producing strong financial results. The estimated fourth quarter revenue penalty from the MAX grounding is expected to be greater than the third quarter. That's simply because we had more MAX aircraft built in the original plan. And unlike Q3 we had 2 point temporary RASM benefit during -- or due to the MAX we expect any fourth quarter RASM benefit to be immaterial. The 2 points or 2 points of estimated RASM benefit removal of the MAX Whites will be offset by the RASM drag from the unoptimized schedule regions in the slightly higher off peak flying. But that being said, our fourth quarter base business trends continue to be very solid. We are continuing to see healthy leisure and business travel demand. That's across the booking curve and we're expecting a solid fourth quarter RASM performance year-over-year in the range of flat to up 2%. All-in with our fourth quarter RASM outlook, this puts us well above our 2019 RASM growth goal in excess of 3%. And all things considered, that's a result that we are very proud of. Just a few of the things, I'm sure that you saw we recently implemented systemwide $5 one-way fare increase. And based on where we are in the booking curve for the fourth quarter I think this likely helps 2020 more that will through the remainder of this year. But we do continue to see solid demand across the booking curve and we do believe the revenue environment continues to support yield momentum and yield strength. And just a few quick comments on Hawaii, with the recent announcement of more Hawaii flights we will now be up to 12 daily California to Hawaii flights and we also have 34 daily inter-island flights. The demand for our service to Hawaii continues to be very very strong and our load factors continue to exceed our system average. The demand for our inter-island service is also very strong. And this also includes a very strong mix of local customers which we're thrilled about. Our brand and customer experience scores continue to perform above our total system Net Promoter Score. And that's true for both our long-haul flights to and from Hawaii as well as for our inter-island flights. As far as our stance on beginning service from originally announced California cities, we still have San Diego left to connect, and we'll do that in the near future. And we're planning for additional flights in 2020 to continue building off our initial success. So looking forward to 2020, we obviously still have some uncertainty related to the MAX return to service date, and Mike and I are very close on this. And as he said, once we can return the aircraft to service, we will be focused on a measured ramp-up of the MAX aircraft. And we're anxious to get the ASMs back in the schedule in a smart way as we begin to restore and grow our network. We will not restore every flight that we've removed due to the MAX grounding, but will certainly want to restore the vast majority of our network, which we'd expect to produce favorable results almost immediately. You can see from our flight schedules published through mid-April that we are very focused on continued investment in Baltimore, Denver, Houston, California and Hawaii. And beyond these cities, we have a very long list of attractive growth opportunities and we will be focused on strengthening our depth and frequencies between strong non-stop city pairs. Next week, we'll be publishing our next set of schedules that take us out through June 6. So stay tuned for that. So with that, I'm going to pass over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Tom, and my thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had another solid quarter of earnings and EPS growth along with margin expansion, which is notable considering the extraordinary challenges resulting from the grounding of the MAX. I'm very grateful for the incredible resiliency and hard work of our employees, and extremely proud of how our Southwest family rally together to produce strong results despite an unanticipated six point to 6.5 point reduction in our capacity this year due to the MAX. Gary, Mike and Tom outlined most of the challenging -- the challenges we're managing through. So I will round out our remarks with commentary on our cost performance, fleet and capacity plans and balance sheet and cash flow, including the related MAX impact. Turning first to our non-fuel cost performance. The largest driver of the 7.6% year-over-year increase and our third quarter CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing or CASM-Ex was an estimated six point to seven point impact from the MAX groundings and resulting flight cancellations. Our third quarter year-over-year capacity growth was approximately eight points lower versus our plan, which will also be the case in fourth quarter. Excluding the MAX related unit cost pressure, the remaining modest year-over-year increase was driven largely by increases in salary wages and benefits as well as maintenance expense. While these cost pressures were anticipated, we did come in favorable to our latest guidance of 8% to 10%. In addition to good cost control across the Board, we saw cost efficiencies and labor cost related to the strong operational and on-time performance that Mike covered earlier. We also received some favorable airport settlements during third quarter as well as lower than expected airport rate increases. Overall, I'd like to commend our employees for executing our cost plan to keep us on target this year excluding the significant year-over-year unit cost pressure from MAX related flight cancellations. We started the year expecting fourth quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to decrease around 2% year-over-year. We've had about one point of year-over-year CASM-Ex shifting from earlier periods into fourth quarter, and we are expecting a fourth quarter unit cost penalty from the MAX groundings to be approximately six point. Therefore, we now expect our fourth quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 4% to 6% range year-over-year. The key drivers year-over-year are increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport cost. It is worth noting that we have taken actions this year to mitigate what impact we could, including on the cost side. As I said previously, our fourth quarter capacity is about eight points lower than it would have been absent the MAX groundings. However, we expect that we will be able to offset about two points to three points of unit cost inflation due to the benefits from higher off-peak flying in fourth quarter, which nets us to our six point penalty. We will continue to focus on these areas to less than the unit cost penalties, but despite our best efforts, the impact to our overall unit cost inflation in fourth quarter continues to be significant. Looking at our full-year non-fuel costs, we currently expect CASM-Ex to increase approximately 8% year-over-year. With some unit cost mitigation in fourth quarter, the MAX groundings are now expected to drive five points of year-over-year inflation to full year 2019, slightly better than we previously estimated. And again, our employees have done an incredible job executing on our plan to control cost pressures. Excluding the impact of the MAX groundings to our 2019 costs, our core year-over-year unit cost performance is in line with our original plan to keep CASM-Ex inflation to 3% to 3.5% for 2019. And that includes factoring and the incremental $10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the 737-700 aircraft that we were going to retire as well as the $42 million bonus for our mechanics. Both of which occurred after our initial three point to 3.5 point unit cost guide back in January. A quick note on first quarter 2020, we expect continued year-over-year unit cost inflation due to the level of fixed cost we carry regardless of the depressed capacity from the MAX grounding currently out to February 8, 2020. And as we gradually ramp back up in addition, we estimate incremental return to service cost in the tens of millions next year. Moving on to fuel, our third quarter fuel price was $2.07 per gallon, near the lower end of our guidance range. Market energy prices spiked following the Saudi Arabia oil attacks around the time of our mid-September 8-K update, and then moderated in the second half of September. The recent volatility in the energy markets served as a reminder of the importance of having meaningful insurance with our fuel hedge program. We are approximately 65% hedged for fourth quarter 2019; for 2020 we are nearly 60% hedged; for 2021 we are around 50%; and we have been adding to our 2022 hedging positions, putting us at around 25% protection. For fourth quarter 2019, based on market prices as of October 18, we expect our fuel price to again being in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per gallon. The fourth quarter crude oil forward curve is slightly lower than third quarter, but fourth quarter heating oil cracks are currently estimated to increase around 20% sequentially. Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX grounding. We came into 2019 expecting a solid year-over-year improvement and fuel efficiency, largely driven by the operating performance of the MAX aircraft, which is expected to produce 20% fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14% improvement over our next generation our NG fleet. Third quarter ASMs per gallon declined 0.9% year-over-year and fourth quarter ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the range of down 1% to 2%. Once the MAX returns to service, we expect to reverse this trend and get back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal. Wrapping up the income statement, as you read in the highlights of our press release, we did record a $31 million reduction to income tax expense late in the quarter, which related to a clarification of regulations that allowed an increase to the amount of tax bonus depreciation relating to our 27% tax return when the rate was 35%.This represented $0.05 per share that was not factored into our previous guidance. Even excluding the tax adjustment, the quarter was a solid feet to expectations. Now turning to fleet and capacity. We have not taken delivery of any aircraft since the MAX groundings in mid-March. We retired one 737 aircraft during the third quarter to end the quarter with 752 total aircraft. We haven't officially updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing at this point, which continues to have 44 total MAX deliveries this year with 41 remaining as of the mid-March grounding. Based on Boeing, targeted regulatory approval of MAX return to service in fourth quarter 2019 Boeing has proposed to revise MAX delivery schedule that has us receiving seven MAX aircraft during fourth quarter 2019. That would result in the remaining 34 MAX deliveries shifting out of 2019 and into 2020. We continue to expect to retire 10 more 737-700s this year for a total of 11 versus our original retirement plan of 2018. We postpone the retirement of seven of our owned -700s to help with our 2019 aircraft deficit. Assuming seven aircraft deliveries in fourth quarter 2019 and netting out our 11 retirements this year, we expect to end 2019 with the total fleet of 749 aircraft. For 2020 based on Boeing's targeted return to service timeline, we expect to be back on our aircraft delivery schedule around mid-2020. This would result in 72 MAX deliveries in 2020 and we currently expect to retire 20 to 25 of our 737-700 aircraft next year, resulting in a total fleet of approximately 800 aircraft by year-end 2020. Our third quarter available seat miles declined 2.9% year-over-year. For fourth quarter 2019, we expect our capacity to decline in the range of 0.5% to 1%, which would put our full year 2019 capacity down approximately 1.5% year-over-year. With ongoing uncertainty of the MAX return to service date, we are not ready to provide annual 2020 capacity guidance at this point. We have published flight schedules through April 13th of 2020, which includes the removal of the MAX through February the 8th. And based on those published schedules, we currently expect first quarter 2020 capacity to increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with very healthy cash and short-term investments of approximately $4 billion. Our cash balance is higher than usual as we haven't been making aircraft delivery payments since a mid-March. Due to a lower number of expected aircraft deliveries in fourth quarter 2019, we now expect our 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion with aircraft related CapEx of approximately $300 million. Our 2019 aircraft CapEx is down approximately $700 million from our original CapEx plan, which will shift to 2020 assuming our aircraft delivery delays are caught up next year. As a result of the MAX groundings, we've incurred $435 million operating income penalty year-to-date. Still, our cash flow generation has been very strong. For the first nine months of 2019, we generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and $2.4 billion in free cash flow with $1.45 billion of share repurchases and $372 million in dividends. Our current $500 million accelerated share repurchase program wraps up next week and we have $1.9 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees. Despite the significant impact from the MAX groundings on our operations and financial results, we generated record operating revenues, record RASM and record net income and earnings per share in third quarter. Our margins and returns on capital were solid considering a two, three point impact to each from the MAX groundings. Absent the impact, we would have expanded margins even further and grown returns in third quarter year-over-year. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained very strong and we continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders. Overall, I am pleased with our strong financial results this quarter and I am very happy with the execution this year especially considering the $435 million year-to-date operating income penalty for the MAX grounding and resulting flight cancellations. Excluding the MAX impacts thus far on a unit basis, we remain on track to achieve our unit revenue and unit cost goal for this year. This is simply outstanding and a true testament to the unwavering fortitude and secret of our Southwest family. All-in-all we have a lot to be proud of and we are eager to get the MAX back in service and resume our growth once the FAA deems to do so. With that, Chad, I'll turn it back to you now to take analyst questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes today from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Appreciate all the uncertainty around next year. But based on what you just outlined if we assume you hit your stride by the third quarter is low-teens growth in the ballpark of what your plan would be? Gary Kelly : Low \u2013 yeah, give me a number. You mean like 12%... Duane Pfennigwerth : 13% 14%. Gary Kelly : No. We'd be below 10% easily. You agree Tammy. Tammy Romo : Yeah. For the full -- yeah, for the full year. Gary Kelly : You're talking about for the year or for the quarter, Duane? Duane Pfennigwerth : For the third quarter, for the back half essentially. Yeah. Gary Kelly : I don't have a number in my mind. What do you think? Tammy Romo : And it is premature. Yeah, it is premature. And yeah, we're not prepared Duane to give you capacity guidance at this point for all the obvious reasons. I'd be happy to kind of walk you through kind of how we're thinking about the full year 2020? But\u2026 Gary Kelly : Well, I would just say, we -- I think Tammy and Mike have both said that, Mike is assuming five to 10 airplanes a week. I don't know whether we can do that or not. I mean, this has never been done before. It's just not a routine thing and we don't have -- we are in the midst of updating our plan for next year to take the MAX off of January 6 return to service. And don't have a plan yet for February 8th. And to be honest with you, we're just going to wait a little while here and see if that's realistic before we go to yet more work to do that only to throw that away and do get another plan. So I think all I was trying to help you with earlier is to say that, we will be something less than 10% for the year, and we'll judge the rate of return based on several factors. I don't want us to pay for airplanes and then have them sit. So some of this we'll have to just work out with Boeing. But we've said, we can restore the fleet between two and four months, but I think there is a lot of assumptions in that. And especially, if you look at the way things have gone, so we're dependent upon our people Boeing and the FAA to return each airplane to service. And there is just -- I'm just meeting to everyone that there is uncertainty with regard to exactly how that's going to get done. Duane Pfennigwerth : All very fair. I agree with your comments and your praise for your planning and you're replanning teams. Can you talk a little bit about how the network response evolved from the initial shock to the system of the grounding and maybe here to the fourth quarter? It feels like initially you were giving up all sorts of traffic, and over time it feels like you figured out how to retain your highest quality traffic. And maybe the share that you're giving up is pretty low quality in nature would appreciate your thoughts. Thank you. Gary Kelly : Well, Tom, do you want to -- you want to comment on that first? Tom Nealon : Yeah. I think we've been looking for a -- I know we're actually to come from myself, but we've been pretty, pretty diligent about trying to trim out some of the longer-haul flying where we can. We've put -- we haven't taken it all out by the way, we've seen some out and what that allows us to do is connecting traffic hence we're maintaining the presence in the markets, we're trying to seasonalize a little bit. We pulled some out of the international, just as an example. And what you're seeing us do is invest in more short and medium-haul flying, in fact, you look at what we just published you're seeing Denver and Baltimore, a little bit in Houston you're seeing more short and medium-haul flying we're getting lot of aircraft utilization. And that's pretty high quality flying and it's really being directed toward city pairs that are very strong for us. So I think we're doing a pretty good job of optimizing the network given what we have to worked with right now. Gary Kelly : Yeah. I think \u2013 Duane, I think your idea there is a decent one. In other words, I don't think it would be correct to assume that we have lost share on 100% of our system. I agree with your logic there. Without studying a little bit more sort of market-by-market. I'm reluctant to just readily agree that there is a large percentage where we haven't lost, because I do have a sense that even where we've been able to sustain frequencies and markets that there may be a shift between locals and connects, and because I agree with Tom, we've taken long-haul segments out and have tried to serve those city pairs on a one-stop basis. And so I just -- it's just more complicated than that, but we've at least been able to sustain for the most part as an entity our short-haul routes or medium-haul routes. We've shaved some long-haul in international, which Tom mentioned. So it's not across the Board, but still we're not happy with the fact that we're eight points below where our capacity would have been. And clearly, we're temporarily losing some share, which we don't like and we've heard our competitors, which they're right to do share that they have picked up some traffic as a consequence. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for the thoughts. Operator : The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hi everybody. Thanks. Gary Kelly : Hi. Hunter Keay : Two questions on the same topic what are the gating term -- gating items if we're getting your fares on Sabre and how much of an incremental pre-tax income should we expect if you're able to come to terms with them? Gary Kelly : Well, the gating issues with Sabre. Well, we've worked with Sabre for a long time. We know Sabre pretty well. They know us pretty well. And obviously, they are the largest US GDS players. So their importance and we certainly you're right it would be crazy not to talk to them as we're going through this, but very simply we just weren't able to get to commercial terms of Sabre, which is unfortunate. I'm thrilled we have two very good partners in Travelport and Amadeus. And there are lot of corporate customers out there. I guarantee who want access to Southwest's content and they will be able to get through those two. So where things go with Sabre I do not know. So we've got a good plan and good set of partners in place right now. So-- Hunter Keay : Okay. Tom and to that, you said there's a lot of corporates that want your products and TMCs that books through Sabre, but what about the TMCs themselves and how willing are you to play in the commission game if the TMCs are not going to be swayed simply by your product alone? Thanks. Tom Nealon : Well, TMC -- thank you for the question, Hunter. I think the -- first of all, we'll be paying our segment fees as we -- as you'd expect the GDS and we're competitive they are pricing. I think it's competitive I don't think its best in industry, but I think that's what we need to do. And I think that part of the play with the TMCs is on the customer side, the customers are going to be asking for that content. So, I think the strength is not just what we think of our product, but I think the strength is what the travel managers think of our product and what the travelers think of that product. And I think that's going to be pull to get the TMCs showing the Southwest content. And by the way to be honest with you, historically, we have not spent a lot of time with TMCs. We just haven't had to -- we didn't. So, we are out there right now with our sales team. And we just -- in fact we had a pretty big group in this past week or two weeks ago. And so we're starting to work with the TMCs and with the travel managers. And there is a real pull for the Southwest content. I guess that's what I can tell you. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you, Tom. Tom Nealon : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey good afternoon everybody. So, Tammy given the current return to service assumption, the five to 10 aircraft, are we getting back to sort of hitting your fleet stride by midyear? It sounds like ex-fuel CASM challenges are going to persist fairly materially in the first half of next year. How confident should we be that those pressures don't subsequently bleed into the second half as well? It just feels like RASM takes a hit as soon as the additional capacity picks up but cost relief is stickier and the markets assumption is that you're going to experience material ex-fuel cost release next year. But given what you've said about the first quarter, the return to service guidance, I'm not convinced that ex-fuel CASM only improves that much. Thoughts? Tammy Romo : Yeah sure. Well, we're obviously going to work really hard to mitigate any costs as we return the MAX to service here. And we'll just have to remain nimble and adjust as we need to. What -- as you -- as you said and what we do know at this point is that we do expect to have a ramp-up unit cost penalty in the first half of 2020. And while we do -- while we'll do what we can to mitigate the financial impact, the penalties are significant and certainly grow as the fleet deficit grows. Of course our discussions with Boeing are ongoing in that regard. But our long-term unit cost target remains unchanged and that's to keep our annual unit cost growth excluding fuel and oil expense and profit sharing to below 2%. So, we haven't lost sight of that goal. And while they are likely to be some inefficiencies as we focus on the safe return of the MAX to service in the short-term, we'll be laser-focused on achieving our long-term cost goal. Jamie Baker : Can you put any numbers on first half or second half ex-fuel CASM? Tammy Romo : It is honestly -- it's just too early to do that. Jamie Baker : Okay. Tammy Romo : We don't even have a return to service plan. So, I just think it's just premature to do that. Obviously, once we have more certainty around return to service, we'll come back and walk you through and give you as much guidance we can. But as we've always said we want to have a measured approach to bring the MAX into service. And we've got a lot of objectives that we're balancing here and certainly hitting our financial targets is one of those objectives. Gary Kelly : Jamie I think the issue is the timing of achieving the spirit of what you're asking. So, I think we're all reluctant to say; yeah, third quarter is going to be really clean. We just don't know. But I think once we get to the point where we are clean, yes, I think that the parameters that you're thinking about without getting specific yet. It makes sense to us. Here is what that's going to be. Jamie Baker : Got it. And Gary for my second question. I saw the headlines -- saw you on CNBC before, the Board looking at a second fleet type. You can obviously achieve that in one of two ways; you can go get in line for deliveries and start from scratch or you can buy an existing fleet and immediately get scale with the aircraft, albeit with some other baggage that inherently company's consolidation. So, is it safe to assume that if the Board is debating a second fleet type as you said today, it's also debating consolidation or is it somehow possible to divorce those two topics because in my mind they're highly intertwined. Gary Kelly : Well, you are a brilliant mind. So, I do think that they are -- they are potentially intertwined, but they could also be disaggregated. I think it just depends on how one wants to think about it. But I'll just give you a straight answer. We are -- as I did say earlier we are focused on two fundamental things. We're focused on settling up with Boeing and we're focused on getting the MAX back into service. The comment that I made about evaluating the question in a single fleet type is -- that's not new news. I've shared that before and we've done it. And they also ask me well what would Herb do and I know what Herb did do because we did this. We looked at it very carefully on several occasions. Mike led that effort as late as 2011 when we agreed to launch the MAX. We gave a very serious look to an alternative. So, I was simply sharing that if -- and the people do. There are people do have this question. Is it time for us to look at the question. Yeah not now, but next year, maybe the following year. It is time to look at that question yet again. I wouldn't prejudge the answer at all. We've been extremely successful for 48 years with a single fleet type. I know that our Vice President of Flight Operations would agree. It certainly makes for a more reliable and arguably safer operation when we have the expertise that we do in this year one. So, there are plenty of good arguments for just I really feel like it's just acknowledging the obvious and I feel like we have a duty to look at the question and especially in light of what's going on right now. So, hopefully that answers part of the question. As you know to say today understanding that we're not entertaining this question today. So to say today does that make us enthused about consolidation. For that reason absolutely not. It's irrelevant. It's because that is -- in that sense they are two different questions. If we got to the point where we said, we want a second fleet type then I would admit you would -- you might want to think that through in terms of that as a means to get to a second fleet type, but I would quickly add. And all I'm doing is repeating our AirTran experience just because we buy another airplane doesn't mean that Southwest instantly have the capability to operate it. So regardless of the path that we do -- that we go through with that hypothetical, we would still in Mike's shop and with technology support have to construct the capability to operate a second fleet type. And that would all have to be factored into whether we think that's the right priority. So those are all really complex questions and not anything that we are thinking about or talking about at this point in time. Jamie Baker : Okay. That's very, very helpful. And thank you for the kind words by the way I hope that some made off the hook for having this build Southwest a couple of quarters ago. Thank you very much. Gary Kelly : No, Herb always said here I wish all timers, which means he always carried the grudge. Thank you. Jamie Baker : Okay. Gary Kelly : There's lot of truth. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Michael Linenberg : Yes. Hey good afternoon guys -- just guys and Tammy. Question here on I think Tom you mentioned about some of the growth you would be focused on Denver, Baltimore and Houston and it does seem like on one hand you may be targeting the markets that are particular competitor, but I suspect that those markets are focused because you can get gates there. And I'm just curious if that is what's driving that decision on one hand and then as we look out are there other airports that are key to Southwest where you do see additional gates coming on maybe over the next 12 to 18 months? Tom Nealon : You know I think that your comment about we're going after the airports where the competition like I say, I think we're looking at this strictly from -- look at the proximity of where Denver is, where Baltimore is, where Houston is and how they fit with our networks. Our intent is to do really begin to use these as cornerstones if you will and drive more connectivity and tightened up the spider web over a point to point network. And that's what's driving it. Now there is a competitive response in all of those by the way. So that's part of it as well. But this is really primarily about strengthening the core of the network. And I do think that there is value to us in adding in more medium and short-haul flying in conjunction with. We're not moving away from long haul at all back the MAX eight great long haul aircraft. But with more medium flying in and out of Denver, Houston, Baltimore it really does give you much greater number of itineraries, it gives you greater operational reliability and recovery. And just a really efficient network structure for us. So I think we're just building on our core point to point network is what you're seeing. Nashville is another one that you see us growing in quite a bit. So that's kind of I'm thinking about it. Michael Linenberg : Okay. And then anything on as it relates to infrastructure, as we look out maybe over the next 12 to 18 months airports that you do -- that are key to you where you do see gates coming on where you're currently constrained? Tom Nealon : No that seems to be where -- we see things great in many places. California we have made constraints obviously. Denver we have capacity coming on it's a ways out. Mike or Gary you guys want to step on it. Gary Kelly : Well Mike, yeah I think you probably know what the corporates are. So I don't -- I don't know that we have anything new to share on that point today. But except to agree with you that they are constraints. Fortunately, we have a vast enough array of opportunities to grow that we can work around them and then in the cases where at least the constraint can be remediated. We're working on those, but LAX is a prime topic and we're very desirous of adding nine more gates through what is envisioned as terminal 1E and we just don't have a timeline with LAWA yet. So that's one that's well under way, but still could be out there before there is a solution. I hope not, obviously we'd love to have that capacity. But yeah I know only thing I was going to quickly just underscore with Tom's answer is we're seeing a return of demand and short haul markets which obviously we have a real strength and we have limited aircraft resources and right now we have more of a focus both in 2019 and in 2020 in addressing that. So it's and you see -- you see evidence of that with the fact that we trimmed a lot of long-haul flights because of the MAX here. So it's not to say that we don't like long-haul flights. It's more to say that we're short of capacity and will be for quite some time and we've -- we can at least address those OND city pairs on a one-stop basis. But if we don't put the flights into the short-haul markets, it's the obvious you're not serving that market. So the good news is we got a lot of opportunities and not as good news is we don't have enough airplanes, but hope to remedy that here soon. Michael Linenberg : Great. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Tom. Gary Kelly : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from with Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey, good afternoon. And just Tammy, I was wondering if you could help us understand I can -- I appreciate just how difficult next year's planning is right now. But I was wondering if you could help us understand just some of the bigger cost items that were pressures this year ex-MAX, how does those trend into next year, should we be thinking about like the airport cost, the maintenance cost, just generally how do you think they should be trending into next year? Tammy Romo : Yeah, sure, Savi, I'll give you a little bit of color here. Just really going into next year the biggest penalty here starting at least in January and that will continue until we get the MAX return to service is related to the grounding of the MAX. Outside of that, I feel pretty good about our cost structure. We do have ongoing maintenance cost pressures and just our normal inflationary cost pressures with salary wages and benefits. And outside of that, we are always looking to balance our technology spend and make sure that any spend or investments that we make obviously have benefits to come along with that. So as we kind of think past the MAX, we've got a lot of initiatives under way. And I feel really good about the efforts that we have. One obviously is our fleet modernization plans and that's been halted here obviously with the MAX grounding, but certainly once we get the MAX back on track, we'll be able to see the benefits there. And certainly on the fuel efficiency side, as I noted earlier. So, just looking past the MAX I really feel good about, where we are. But as always that always takes hard work, and but our people are up to that. So I'm confident, we'll deliver there. So, and again, I'll just kind of point you back to our long-term goals is to maintain inflation CASM-Ex sub 2%. Savi Syth : That's helpful, Tammy. Is that kind of sub 2% does that include kind of \u2013 any kind of upcoming labor deals as well where you kind of target that again excluding that? Tammy Romo : Yes. Thanks for asking that, Savi. Yes, we incorporate labor cost into that in all of our cost pressures. And what cost pressure as it mentioned simply because we \u2013 I think we alluded to that earlier is airport cost pressures. So, that's one cost pressure that we'll continue have to work hard over the longer term to control. Savi Syth : All right. Great. And if I might just ask is it a quick clarification question on the growth. If I think about next year is Hawaii is still kind of a large part of kind of next year's growth assuming you can grow as you want to grow or how should we think about kind of the composition, if you can do what you want to do? Gary Kelly : You know just keep in perspective Hawaii. There's a lot of people around Hawaii. We're pretty excited about Hawaii it's a very, very modest portion of our network. It's like less \u2013 point of our network. So you got to continue invest and we're off to a great start. We want to continue to build on the momentum, but even if we were to \u2013 I'm not sure exactly given what our status of our plan for next year is, but it's not going to be a massive portion of our capacity, it's just \u2013 which is not you will see focus on California as I've said California, Denver, Baltimore, Houston. Hawaii we're going to stay committed to we're absolutely committed to Hawaii by the way, if anyone wants to know we're going to back off Hawaii absolutely not. We've opened five stations in Hawaii. That's performing really well. So, we're not backing off. It may have to pace a little bit depending upon the MAX, but Hawaii is going to be a focus \u2013 was going to be a relatively modest piece of our capacity I think. Savi Syth : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Katie O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Katie O'Brien: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for the time. So not to keep harping on the cost outlook here, but I guess just, if I think about you're 2% to 3% capacity forecast for the first quarter. And then just think about it. Can I assume that CASM growth is just linear with cost growth that would get me to based on what you're planning to do in the fourth quarter here. That would get me to a first quarter CASM-ex of around 3%. All else equal, I guess just starting there what are the puts and takes that would \u2013 that I should be thinking about to get me away from that number. Thank you. Tammy Romo : Yes, just looking ahead to the first kind of going into the first quarter. Katie O'Brien: That's correct. Tammy Romo : Yeah. So just to just to make a few points in the first quarter, and I think this will help address your question. So excuse me, if I'm a little bit redundant. But keep in mind we've got the schedules out through first quarter 2020. And at this point, the MAX canceled through February 8. So, I just want to point out that we do have some conservatism built into our February schedule. We \u2013 and again all this is contingent upon the deliveries how those resume from Boeing but based on what they've indicated, they are targeting here in the fourth quarter, we would expect to have around 50 MAX aircraft in our fleet at the beginning of February. And that of course, includes the 34 MAX 8s that are currently grounded. Yet, we'll only have 30 MAX aircraft worth the flying for sale in our February 2020 schedule and that ramps to 65 aircraft in our March schedule. And as you all know, there is strong demand, and we have pent-up demand here at Southwest. So, we'll want to ramp-up prudently but we certainly want to ramp-up as quickly as we can and to utilize our assets and to absorb some of the cost pressure that we're obviously experiencing here in the fourth quarter. So, currently the largest step up of aircraft coming back in the service is from the seasonally off-peak February time period into March. And that's how we met to the current first quarter capacity number that you mentioned, which is up to 2% to 3% year-over-year. And but most importantly, we will want to be measured and deliberate in the way we introduce that MAX aircraft safely back into service. But all of these planning assumptions change, if we have to extend our flights cancellations further. So, hopefully you can appreciate how difficult it is to announce now down a solid plan and cost guidance for even this environment. But all that said, we're focused on delivering solid results and focused on mitigating those cost pressures as much as we can. And of course, as always our goal would be to have positive RASM in the first quarter. So we're looking to balance all of that. So, we'll have to manage our flight cancellation impact of the schedule very carefully, as each time period has its own set of unique challenges, but again based on the current environment, I feel pretty good that we can do that. So we expect the year-over-year unit cost penalties to continue and will face those headwinds as we ramp back up, but will you know as we get past the MAX the penalties that we've shared as to you throughout the year, we would expect those to reverse and turn into tailwinds next year once we get past the return to service and we're back up to our normal capacity plans. So that was a long-winded answer, but that's just wanted to give you a little bit of color so that you can appreciate how difficult it is for us to nail down cost guidance. Katie O'Brien: Yes. No definitely a lot of moving pieces here. It seems like an ever moving target on this return date. So, really appreciate all the work you guys and the employees that I've had to do. I guess, just maybe one quick follow-up to that question and then one more, so I guess is there. And again, I \u2013 as I just said, I really appreciate all moving pieces here, but I guess is there anything that we should think about as we go into the first quarter that would either prevent costs from improving on a linear basis or help costs improve even more than that. Just in terms of I know the return on service costs or some \u2013 or some good guides maybe we're forgetting about from earlier this year that will create a tailwind. And then just on non-aircraft CapEx, how should we think about that next year and going forward I know you got a lot of irons in the fire on the technology front. Thank you very much for the time. Gary Kelly : Tammy, let me jump in here. I think there is way too much focus on the first quarter with your question. You know the cost performance here in the third and the fourth quarter looks really good to me. And so I feel like we'll be able to continue managing as best we can. The issue is a numerator and a denominator there is unabsorbed overhead. And until we get the airplanes flying you're going to have that cost penalty rolling forward. And especially compared to a year ago. That's number one. Number two, as it is not linear. So what Mike has to do, if we're going to ramp up our flying he has to hire he has to hire in advance. So it is actually front loaded. And now the question becomes a judgment on our part about how much we front-load. And to be honest with you, we don't know yet. We don't know how many people we're going to hire, at what point. In the first quarter, what Mike is trying to do is he has got two chances here, he can hit the peak for spring break or we'll miss that and then we'll try to hit the peak and I'm talking about flying. And then we'll try to hit the peak flying for say June. And so we just don't know how it will ramp up yet. I think we will get much more visibility over the next 30 days. But we'll still have to continue to make a judgment about whether we're even going to hit this February the 8th date. So I think, I know you want a number. I think basically what we're trying to do is make sure that we don't waste money here until we get back to something that is more manageable. But until we get there, and this is just our honest truth, it will be messy and we don't -- and we are not in total control. We're not in control of what Boeing can do. We're not in control of what the FAA can do to support our return to service. That's all assuming that we do we're on a path returning to service at that point. Katie O'Brien: Just to apologize for the short-term nature of that question. And then just maybe Tammy on the non-aircraft CapEx, any comments there. And thank you again for all the time. Tammy Romo : Yes, sure. And just to add one more comment on the call because I can't help myself is we are telling up all those damages and obviously have ongoing discussions with Boeing. And yes and on the -- on the non-CapEx aircraft CapEx 2019 is roughly in the $800 million range and so that not I'm expecting a significant departure from that for next year but as we've said many times we just have it wrapped up our plan for all the obvious reasons and once we do we'll come back and give you more precision around what we're doing next year. Katie O'Brien: Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Joe Caiado : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. Gary and Tom, you've teased us with some new revenue initiatives that you have in the pipe for 2020. It sounds like summer are getting ready for primetime like the corporate travel initiative that Tom walked through in great detail. Appreciate that. Are there any other of these revenue initiatives for 2020 that are getting ready for primetime that you might care to share with us today? Gary Kelly : Well, no, not today. I think the GDS is the big ones in the pipe for 2020. There is lots of work going on right now for -- there is a pretty rich -- there is a pretty rich revenue initiative pipeline and we always \u2013 take you through it. So I wish I could I'm pretty excited about it but we're going to pace it out. These are all -- they are kind of sequence in such a way one builds upon the other in terms of the technology foundation. So it's not you just throw these all there one time they are very -- it's a very adds and kind of process but GDS is a big foundational piece for us. And we're going to put that in. And then we have words that follows that subsequent to that but I think we have really great pipeline I'm just not going to talk about today. Joe Caiado : Okay. Gary Kelly : The other thing is what is -- what's interesting for us next year is there is a lot of capacity that's on the sideline that's going to return at some point. And so I think we've made clear that we're not just going to put back in what we took out. So there is an opportunity there to up to optimize and Tom answer the question earlier about Hawaii. Tom, I don't think with what we're going to add back next year there is that much development flying. I think it's and that's sort of the to reemphasize ,it sounds boring perhaps to you all but adding to Denver, adding to BWI, adding to Houston should generate strong returns quickly and that's part of our strategy for next year is a great revenue idea. It's not new but it is what it is -- what I wouldn't discount too much is the fact that we've taken the network. We've taken some capacity out. Now we're going to reoptimize that network we're forced to but we're trying to do it in a way that it produces a superior product and I'm really excited about that. So whether we'll just have to get out and play the game and see how good that turns out but I'm -- the emphasis on the short-haul markets which are very quarter for Southwest emphasis on still retaining a presence and longer haul O&D markets and maybe on a one-stop basis. I'm pretty excited about all of that. Joe Caiado : Okay, great thank you both. And maybe just a very quick follow-up for Tammy, clarification question really. The incremental cost sort of associated with the return to service -- explicitly associated with the return to service, are you going to include those in your 2020 CASM-Ex guidance when you do provide that or are you going to exclude them and adjust them out? Tammy Romo : We would include that. Joe Caiado : Okay, got it. Thanks, everyone. Gary Kelly : Okay great. Well that wraps up the analyst portion of our call. And as always if you have any follow-up questions feel free to give me a ring. So thank you all for joining. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. I would like to welcome members of the media to our call today and we can go ahead and get started with our Q&A session. Chad if you'll just give them instructions on how to queue up. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. Just to ask quickly about the fleet diversification review and this sounds a little bit like more of a formal process in the ongoing kind of kicking the tires that you've described in the past. Is that right and what kind of factors and metrics you will be looking at as part of this review? Gary Kelly : Alison, I'd say yes and no. In terms of the literal looking at different airplane, it's no different than what we've ever done. The only thing that we will -- I feel we are obligated to do is, just debate the wisdom strategically of having a sole source vendor and one fleet type. That is different. I don't know that we've ever focused on it with that kind of intensity. And I don't want to prejudge the answer to that. They are -- but they are two different questions. You can say, we'd love to have a separate fleet type, but when we look at it, it just may be economically and operationally and feasible. And vice versa, we may find that even without the strategic necessity of having two we may discover, I doubt it, but we may discover that it's better to have two airplanes economically and operationally. So all of that will need to be thought through. But again, it just addresses a question of -- the obvious question and we posted and our Board agrees with it and we'll study it at the right time. I've said next year, and I don't feel that is a deadline by the way, but it's mainly to make clear that with the questions that we've had so far on that topic. We've made clear, we are not thinking about that right now. We're not working on it. It is not an issue. We have two things we're focused on and that's settling up with Boeing and getting the MAX return to service. That is our focus. And as you can tell from listening, there's a tremendous amount of work involved running the airline in the meantime with the uncertainty of when it comes back. So at the right point in time we'll take a look at that. And as I tried to make clear this morning. That's not new news. What we've said that months ago that we would maintain these things as our priority and that we would look at that question later. Alison Sider : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And if I can ask one more, one of your employees, Mark Forkner is the focus of the DOJ and correctional investigations for his role in developing the MAX and some messages from when he was at Boeing suggesting he may have detected some issues with MCAS or unintentionally misled regulators. Do you have any concerns about those messages or concerns with him working at FAA or MAX issues now that he is at Southwest? Gary Kelly : Well, those are clearly issues unrelated to his Southwest employment. And so, that -- all of that investigation will have to run its course. And so it has nothing to do, as far as I am aware, with his employment at Southwest. So by all accounts he is a very fine man and does a fine job for us. Alison Sider : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tracy Rucinski : Hi. I was wondering, what your internal research and bookings at February 8 are telling you about customers' willingness to fly the MAX. And to what extent that sentiment is playing into your planning for putting the aircraft back into your network? Gary Kelly : Okay. This is challenge [ph], so I'll be glad to take that question. It's a good question. Obviously this is something that's getting media nearly every day, so the consumers are very, very aware obviously. I think what it say is we do expect there to be some uneasiness, the early days in the aircraft return to service is very natural. You expect that it's natural given the nature of the situation. Just how much intention has been focused on by the media. Having said that though we've been doing research every -- very frequently, so this thing has come -- has happened in March, rolling bands of research if you will and what we're finding is that there is very little difference originally versus what we're hearing today. So what we are hearing is this. Southwest has a very, very strong reputation of being safe line to safer line of flight. They have confidence in Southwest and they trust us, number one. We're also very consistent hearing that a majority of customers, not just our customers but travelers do not expect to change their flying behavior based on aircraft type. That's an interesting learning, which has also been very consistent. There are some travelers though who are saying and it is a minority, who are saying they will have -- they'll be looking for different aircraft when they fly. And they may try to avoid the MAX for a month to three months or six months but that is a minority. But based on what we\u2019re listening to and hearing from our customers, we feel like we have a pretty good understanding, you may have to figure out how do you begin to insert that into what do you plan financially from a business standpoint in terms of book away phenomena. So we're still working through that but we are sensing as that the customers really are -- they will come back, our core customers are very confident and loyal to Southwest and we feel pretty good about that. Tracy Rucinski : Can you give us a little sense of when you said that there isn't much difference from originally versus today? Can you -- and you talk about the minority, can you give us a little bit more color on what that looks like in percentage terms? Gary Kelly : Well, I'm not sure I have all the specific facts in my head, but I think the majority, I think it's kind of a super majority actually. And so I'm not going to give you a precise number, but it is a super majority or saying. This is not that bigger an issue for me. I'm not going to change my flying behaviors. I think, it's in the high '60s, and '70s very significant. So, I'm not going to do justice by trying to give you all the little fact to it's. But it is a minority. Its real minorities opposed to a -- almost 50-50. And we feel good. Our customers feel very -- they aren't easy just like everyone else. They want to see the aircraft fly. They want to be sure to say, but they really do have confidence in the way we're going to bring this back into service. And Tom may have mentioned this but the other thing to note or maybe repeat is that, when we survey our customers' do you trust southwest? The trust factor is extremely high and higher than our competitors, quite frankly. So, I think, that all of this they -- all the research we've done suggests that time will address this. So the airplane comes back into service. It performs well.  And I think most people answer the questions by saying, well, I won't fly it for six months, for those who deselect flying it or I might not fly it for 12 months. And so, I think, we feel that the research supports, and our history supports, and our judgment would say that, that will be short-lived. Tom Nealon : One just or little fact what kind of helps validate, what Gary's last comment was our customers do have the ability to see what aircraft they are flying. And you might think that given all the news in the MAX and all this stuff going on, that there will be a higher propensity to be checking those aircraft and that -- it's like less than a single-digits. So it's actually less than 1%. So, I just don't think people are really as focused on it as we are being in the industry. I think, this is going to -- this will take care of itself I think right. Gary Kelly : In other words we're taking bookings for the MAX now. It's in our schedule -- that's in our schedule, as of February the 8th. And there is nothing abnormal -- we're seeing no competitors, we see no book away. Operator : At this time, we will take the last question that we have. And that is from Dawn Gilbertson with The USA Today. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. Two questions unrelated. The first on the MAX, I don't know Gary or Tammy or somebody, can you give us an update on where you are in the negotiations with Boeing, for is there any timetable there for recovering damages. And my second question has to do with fees? I'm wondering if you can give us an update on year-to-date EarlyBird revenue and upgraded boarding, and whether you might be considering any changes there to the fees. Thank you. Gary Kelly : Well, Tammy is leading the -- she's going to work on your second question. She is leading a couple of negotiations for us but she is working -- she and Mike are working together with Boeing. The Tammy has got to lead on it. And yeah, I'm impatient on that, I'm anxious for that to get wrapped up. So no, I can't give you a timeline other than to say, it's a major objective of ours -- of mine. And I want that ramped up quickly. Tammy Romo : And on EarlyBird, I have the fourth quarter, our numbers which would be helpful kind of as you think about annualizing that maybe going forward. We had very strong EarlyBird performance in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter alone that was probably $112 million $113 million. And our upgraded boarding was about $20 million, both up significantly from the prior year. And our third quarter was -- our third quarter was up about 19%. So, we're running on well over $100 million with respect to EarlyBird. So, it's been -- it's been a tremendous success and obviously a very popular product for our customers. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Tammy Romo : I have a year-to-date number for you, just took us a minute to pull it, It was $342 million year-to-date. Dawn Gilbertson : For EarlyBird or both of those? Tammy Romo : It's for EarlyBird. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : All right, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford, for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you very much. If you all have any other question or inquiries, you can contact our communications group 214-792-4847 or you can send in inquires through our online newsroom at www.swamedia.com. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Annual 2019 Conference Call. My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thanks, Chad, and thank you all for joining us. I know it\u2019s a busy airline earnings day. But we\u2019re going to start out with prepared remarks from Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. And then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. A few quick disclaimers before we get started here. We will make forward-looking statements in our remarks, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and of course, our actual results could differ from current expectations for a number of reasons. We called out special items in 2018, and we will make reference to 2019 results that compare to prior year non-GAAP results. Both of these topics are covered in great detail, as always, in our earnings release disclosures as well as on our IR website. And we are also providing commentary today regarding the ongoing MAX groundings and our current estimations of time lines and current planning assumptions for 2020. Keep in mind, these time lines and estimations could change materially with impacts on the amount of financial damages we incur, our published flight schedule beyond June 6 and our fleet capacity and CapEx assumptions, to name a few. With all of that said, we\u2019ll go ahead and get started, and I\u2019m turning over the call to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings call. Straight away, I want to thank our employees. This is our 49th year, and they\u2019re \u2013 at least in my experience, there is no more remarkable year than 2019. The grounding of effectively 75 of our airplanes, which is about 10% of our fleet presents a crisis-like challenge. And our people were ready work with the best planning tools and technologies in our history, but more importantly, with the right fortitude and the right resolve to get through this crisis. Our objectives were to run a great airline, serve our customers exceptionally well, protect our finances and our jobs and follow through with our capital projects that were underway. And we were able to do all those things. The MAX groundings reduced our annual operating income of $828 million. Our earnings were still a record on a per share basis, non-GAAP basis, at $4.27. And that is truly remarkable. But they would have been 28% higher and 20% \u2013 27% more than a year ago but for the MAX. You can do the math on the stock price effect, but we settled with Boeing for the 2019 MAX groundings, and the settlement seems to have zero effect on the price per share, by the way. But we also intend to settle up 2020 as well. So we\u2019re three months later since our last earnings call, and unfortunately, we\u2019re still talking about the MAX unhappily. I\u2019m confident about the MAX. More importantly, our pilots are confident about the MAX. Boeing needs to get the work done and get the certification flight done, give the FAA a chance to do their work and unground this airplane. But right now, we\u2019re scheduled for a June 6 return, which implies an ungrounding several months before Boeing surprised us all this week with their June, July predictions about the ungrounding. And obviously, that would make our and other airlines\u2019 June dates unworkable. So the timing remains uncertain, and we\u2019re working through all of that right now. Our goals for 2020, given all of this, are very straightforward. We want to return the MAX to service. We want to continue to run a great operation, in fact, even better. We want to continue to serve our customers very well with exceptional hospitality, and in fact, even better. We want to protect our finances and our jobs and continue to keep costs low and slow the rate of inflation and do that even better. We want to settle with Boeing for 2020 compensation. We want to continue on with the capital projects that are underway. And then finally, we want to keep our network intact and continue making what modest tactical adjustments we\u2019re able to do. Having said all those things and all assumed that demand and the economy remains strong and that the oil prices remain stable and low, if we can continue to execute against all these goals, that means that we only have one problem, and that\u2019s fleet growth. So with regard to the fleet, we\u2019re assuming that the MAX grounding is short-lived, meaning there are months to go and not years to go. And with that in mind, we are aggressively pursuing a couple of tactical ideas. Number one is mainly our 700 retirement schedule where we have a lot of flexibility. So we\u2019re actively deferring retirements where it makes sense. Secondly, we\u2019re always monitoring the used 737 aircraft market. We\u2019ll continue to do that. Our issue is simple. It is our seat growth is not keeping up with demand, much less allowing us to expand. And we\u2019re losing share, but all that is temporary, and we plan to aggressively recapture it once the MAX is ungrounded and are in a superb position, given our return on invested capital. There is no change in our efforts to evaluate the risk/reward of a single aircraft type or supplier. We\u2019ll do that. It\u2019s just a lower 2020 priority, so there\u2019s no update there. I\u2019ll also preempt the M&A question by repeating what I\u2019ve said earlier : I do not agree that the MAX crisis compels us to acquire another carrier. We would not overpay. We would not commit us to a course that\u2019s inconsistent with our strategy. And of course, as is our policy, we do not comment on rumors or speculation, about any M&A activity. And then finally, I want to thank our Board for making an amendment for our 2019 profitsharing. And even though the Boeing compensation is for 2019, it is not included in 2019 profits. And that\u2019s not fair to our people for their profitsharing. So as a result of that, $124 million was added. And of course, that reduced our fourth quarter profits, but that makes the total annual profitsharing contribution a record $667 million. And our folks earned it, and I just wanted to congratulate them. So taking that notable item into account, we beat consensus. So with that quick overview, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mr. Van de Ven to take us through our operations. Mike Van de Ven : Well, thanks, Gary. And as Gary was mentioning, given all of our headwinds that we were facing, it was extremely important that we run a reliable customer-friendly operation in the fourth quarter. And our people certainly delivered. They produce the best overall operation we\u2019ve had in over a decade. Our system-wide on-time performance for the fourth quarter was 82.4%, and we accomplished that with the least amount of block and turn time in the industry. And that\u2019s a big factor in our operational efficiency that lowers our cost through superior aircraft utilization. It\u2019s the low cost coupled with the great service that allows us to win. On the service front, this was the first quarter where we had bag scanning implemented throughout our domestic network. We emplaned 30.9 million bags in the quarter, and 99.6% of those bags were carried on flights as checked. That is a record fourth quarter performance for Southwest Airlines. And our customers noticed. Through November, Southwest, again led the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratios reported by the DOT. And based on our preliminary December results, we expect to close out the year in a similar fashion. And frankly, our people have been delivering this kind of exceptional service the entire year and all the while dealing with the significant activities associated with the MAX grounding. So in that environment, we grew our Hawaii service to over 1 million customers in just 9.5 months. We implemented plane-side scanning for bags across the domestic network, and we continue to implement technology enhancements across all of our operating and functions. So for all of 2019, excluding Hawaiian Airlines, Southwest finished in the top three in the industry in on-time performance and bag handling and with the lowest customer complaint ratio, all as measured by the DOT. And that\u2019s the best combined yearly industry performance since 1999. And our people believe that they can improve from there. Through yesterday, our January on-time performance was 87.7%. That is just a superb start to the year. It\u2019s one of our best. In fact, we\u2019ve only achieved an 85% January on-time performance or better five times since 1988. And it\u2019s the on-time performance that sets the foundation for bag handling, for customer complaints and for cost control. There\u2019s no better team in this industry than our Southwest people. And they support our customers, our company, each other, and they are just relentless in execution. And they are the heart and the soul and the spirit of Southwest. So turning to the MAX for a moment. Our guiding principle of relaunching this aircraft continues to be an orderly and controlled manner, one which we can execute with a high degree of confidence and certainty. And that\u2019s been a critical focal point for our team, and we planned and we\u2019ve replanned our return to service activities as new information becomes available. So since the beginning of the year, we have learned of two significant additional considerations : first, the Boeing recommendation for both simulator and CBT training for our pilot prior to their operation of the airplane; and then secondly, Boeing\u2019s most recent estimate of a mid-2020 return to service date. As you know, we have presently removed all MAX flying from our schedules through June 6. And with this new information, it seems pretty clear that we\u2019re going to need to make further schedule adjustments into the summer. So we\u2019re replanning yet again using the best set of facts and insights and all the necessary activities, and we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments well in advance so that our customers\u2019 travel plans aren\u2019t significantly disrupted. We have 34 MAX aircraft on our operating certificate. They\u2019re in Southwest Airlines\u2019 control, and they\u2019re stored in Victorville, California. Those aircraft must go through maintenance and make-ready work before they\u2019re ready for service. We also have 27 MAX aircraft that Boeing has built, and they\u2019re being stored by Boeing until the aircraft are certified to fly. Those 27 must still go through the delivery and acceptance process in addition to any make-ready work to be added to the Southwest Airlines operating certificate. Those combined 61 aircraft are our most reliable source of lift once the aircraft is cleared to fly. And as I\u2019ve stated in earlier calls, we believe that we can manage around 5 to 10 aircraft a week from this collective pool to be reintroduced to the operation. So it will take at least a couple of months for those aircraft to return to service. And our crewing is in place today to operate them. Boeing still contractually owes us 51 more aircraft this year. That\u2019s the 2019 carryover plus the 2020 deliveries. And with our production line shutdown, the delivery quantities and the dates are in flux. We\u2019re going to continue discussions with them to work through what\u2019s reasonable for both of us as their plans become better defined. So turning to training. Our initial training plans included the 30-day period for all of our pilots to complete the expected CBT training before we begin flying the aircraft and revenue service. Boeing is now recommending the additional simulator training. And the training requirements will be finalized at a later date after the JOEB completes their testing. These requirements will dictate the time it takes for us to complete our pilot training. We currently have three MAX sims on property, and we have worked with our simulator manufacturer, CAE, to provide us with three additional MAX simulators to be training-ready before the summer. That will give us at least six MAX simulators available for training by the time the aircraft is released to fly, and that will significantly reduce our training time from where we started. Beyond these six, we have three more simulators deliveries planned for the second half of 2020, and we\u2019re working on expected in-service dates for them. That will close 2020 for us with nine MAX simulators. I cannot thank CAE enough for their partnership and support. We have had a strong relationship with them for many, many years, and they have helped create one of the leading flight ops training centers in the world. Assuming for a second that the simulator training maybe two hours, this as a baseline, it will take us at least a couple of additional amounts from where we were to get all of our pilots through that training. So there\u2019s still a lot of moving parts to nail down the return-to-service plan. The FAA is in control of the regulatory ungrounding process, and our plans begin once they clear the aircraft to fly. From that date, we\u2019re assuming it will take several weeks to get our manuals updated and our CMO to approve our changes. And then once that is accomplished, we can begin training our pilots and bringing the aircraft into their operational state. And as I mentioned, it will take at least a couple of additional months before the aircraft are ready for revenue service and our pilots are trained. In the meantime, we still plan on performing extensive validation flights to work out any effects of the aircraft for sitting so long to also reintroduce them to our people and to make sure that we are completely comfortable with the aircraft performance before any customer set foot on the aircraft. Wrapping up, our operation is running very, very well. We have a detailed plan to relaunch the MAX, and we\u2019ll be adjusting it as we get better information. Our people are taking great care of our customers and each other, and they\u2019re delivering a safe, reliable product. They are the best team that I have ever been around. And it is a pleasure to support them. And with that, over to you, Tom. Tom Nealon : Okay. Thank you, Mike. I just really have to echo Mike and Gary and also share my congratulations and my thanks to all of our employees. They are absolute warriors, and they are Southwest heros. 2019 was a very challenging year with the MAX, but we also had a great year. We really did have a great year in our people across every work group just kept rising to the challenge time and time and time again. When the MAX was grounded, as Gary said, in March of last year, we were very clear about our priorities. First, we are absolutely committed to running a great operation. We\u2019re absolutely focused on taking great care of our customers. And third, we are very focused on delivering very strong financial results. And we did all three. And we did it very, very well. As Mike said, the operation was rock solid, arguably the best operation in a decade. Also, as Mike said, our DOT customer sat score is at the very top of the industry. And what I didn\u2019t say is, keep in mind, that\u2019s the year when we had to proactively re-accommodate, literally, millions of customers. And our brand scores also remain the highest in the industry and among the highest in the world for any company, not just airlines. So the customer service and the hospitality that we\u2019re so famous for is stronger than ever, and our people just continue to take great care of our customers and one another. So our fourth quarter RASM results were right in line with our original October guidance of flat to up 2%. Our fourth quarter revenue grew 40 basis points to a record of $5.7 billion, and that was despite a nearly 1% decline in capacity. And we also grew our RASM 1.3%, which is also a record performance. Our base business was very strong and was the driver of our Q4 RASM performance. This was really the result of strength in both demand and yield. We also had very strong performance in our other revenues. More specifically, our Rapid Rewards program performed very well, which I\u2019ll talk about more in just a minute. We also had very strong performance from our early bird and upgraded boarding products, both of which had double-digit growth in the quarter. Now as I said on our third quarter call, we made the decision in the fall 2019 to republish our November and December schedules, really with two objectives in mind. First, we want to minimize any customer disruption and inconvenience during the holiday travel season. And second, we wanted to ensure that we ran a great operation with lower capacity. And we achieved both objectives, but we also knew that we weren\u2019t optimizing RASM for the peak versus off-peak seasonality in the fourth quarter. And as expected, the two to three points of temporary year-over-year RASM benefit that we saw in the third quarter from the removal of the MAX didn\u2019t occur in the fourth quarter because of the suboptimized Q4 schedules. Now none of that was a surprise to us. The net effect of this is that there was no material year-over-year MAX impact to Q4 RASM, which, again, is what we expected and shared with you on the last call. And I got to say, once again, our network planning team just did a phenomenal job of developing workable solutions to protect the strength of our network and to minimize customer disruption. And the same call out to our revenue management team, did an equally incredible job of managing the revenue and yields throughout the quarter. We also had very strong revenue growth in our other revenues. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform extremely well. For the full year, our other revenue grew nearly 11%. In the fourth quarter, performance was a strong 9% growth. And we\u2019re continuing to see record passenger mix continued \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re seeing the reward pass-through mix continue to grow, which really speaks to the strength and the value of the program for our customers. Now we\u2019re also continuing to see very strong growth in spending on our co-brand credit cards. And the sheer size and growth of our credit card portfolio is very healthy with nearly double-digit growth and very low attrition. So we continue to be very pleased with the economics in the structure of our program, as well as with our partnership with Chase. So to sum up Q4, the bottom line is very simple, very steady, strong demand for both leisure and business, continued strength in pricing, strength in our other revenues and continued industry leading strength in our customer and brand scores. The story line for Q1 is very similar to what we experienced in Q4. The underlying trends around demand and pricing that we experienced in Q4 have continued into Q1. Everything that we\u2019re seeing for the quarter shows very solid shopping and bookings. So demand remains solid for both leisure and business travel and pricing also remain steady and strong. So we have a very good read on first quarter revenue in RASM trends. Obviously, we continue to be impacted by the MAX, we pulled the MAX out of our April schedule, which runs through June 6. And as you know, March is the peak month in the first quarter and our MAX aircraft deficit grows from 34 aircraft in March of 2019 to roughly 60 aircraft short by March of 2020. Now that said in Q1, we don\u2019t have the flight schedule variations in the capacity and demand mismatch complications that we have in the fourth quarter. So because of that, we expect a 2-point year-over-year RASM benefit in Q1 from the MAX cancellations. We also have roughly 0.5 point year-over-year RASM tailwinds in the first quarter from prior year negative impacts, 1 point due to the government shutdown and 0.5 point due to the unscheduled maintenance cancellations in Q1 of last year. So based on the strength of our base business as well as the Q1 MAX RASM impact in the year-over-year tailwinds, we expect a strong Q1 RASM performance in the range of up to 3.5% to 5.5%. I\u2019ve said this before, but I think it\u2019s worth repeating as we continue adjusting the flight schedules for MAX cancellations, our focus is to maintain depth and frequency of service to key markets. And we\u2019re also very focused on maintaining a high degree of point-to-point direct flying, as well as maintaining high quality connecting itineraries. Now when you look at our schedule, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve trimmed some capacity from longer haul markets and we\u2019ve added more capacity into our short and medium haul flying, which is a real core strength of our network. Just to be clear, in no way, we\u2019re walking away from long haul flying, but with the MAX out of service, we have opportunities to replace profitable, but below system average RASM, long haul, non-stop itineraries with high quality connecting itineraries. We will do that. And with the strength of our point to point network, we have the flexibility to do that. Now, once the MAX returns to service, we\u2019ll certainly restore the vast majority of flights that have been taken out of our schedules and we\u2019ll do so in a way that lines up their operations and commercial objectives. We have the world\u2019s largest and strongest point-to-point network and we intend to leverage our cost structure and our scale and we certainly intend to resume our growth. And we tell you, we have a long runway of growth opportunities still in front of us. Now despite the MAX cancellations, we\u2019ve continued to add additional flights into some of our key markets. We have near-term growth focus will continue to be in Baltimore, Denver, Houston, Hawaii. Hawaii continues to perform very well from both long haul and interisland markets and this is totally consistent with our plans and our expectations. Now looking beyond Q1, obviously, our 2020 growth will be determined by the MAX return-of-service. Until that occurs, we\u2019ll just continue to adjust our plans accordingly. And our objectives are no different than what they were in 2019. We\u2019ll run a great operation. We\u2019ll take great care of our customers and we\u2019ll deliver strong financials. And as Mike alluded to, if we need to make further adjustments to our June schedule, which runs from June 7 through early August, we\u2019ll do so. And that would like to include further trends to our non-stop long haul flights and potentially a modest thinning of high-frequency markets, which is essentially the same playbook that we\u2019ve been running for the past several schedules. We also have a full pipeline of revenue and cost initiatives, most of which we won\u2019t discuss yet for competitive reasons. But I can tell you that we\u2019re on track to implement our new GDS capabilities for corporate travel by mid-year with Travelport and Amadeus, which we expect to drive incremental EBITDA between $10 million and $20 million in the second half of 2020 and there\u2019s clearly a very large opportunity to grow that substantially over the next several years. So that\u2019s where we are. Q1 is off to a strong start. Trends remain strong and we\u2019re guiding our RASM to be up 3.5% to 5.5%. And once the MAX return-to-service, we are ready to bring it back into service with all the operational and commercial discipline that you would certainly expect in Southwest Airlines. So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. I\u2019d also like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts managing through a very challenging year. The MAX grounding have had a significant impact on our company, but our employees continue to rise to the occasion and the strong results we reported this morning simply would not have been possible without their hard work and incredible focus and teamwork. With the MAX return-to-service timeline shifting frequently, it has been difficult to anchor our full year 2020 forecast to support meaningful guidance for the full year. So I\u2019ll focus primarily on first quarter guidance and my comments today regarding our cost performance, fleet capacity and CapEx plans, and our strong financial position. During fourth quarter, as a Gary of covered, we reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for compensation related to 2019 financial damages due to the MAX groundings. The compensation from Boeing will be accounted for as a reduction of the purchase price of our 31 owned MAX aircraft and future MAX from orders, which reduces property and equipment on our balance sheet and will result in lower depreciation expense over the useful life of the aircraft. In light of this agreement, our Board of Directors authorized a $124 million pre-tax profitsharing award. This incremental award was accrued in fourth quarter and reduced fourth quarter earnings by $97 million or $0.18 per diluted share as we covered in the release. A record $264 million in fourth quarter profitsharing expense included a $124 million discretionary award and will be paid later this quarter as part of the record $667 million full year 2019 profitsharing distribution to employees. So now that I\u2019ve covered profitsharing, I\u2019ll go ahead and cover fuel costs before I move into our cost performance, excluding fuel and profitsharing. Our fourth quarter fuel price of $2.09 per gallon, decreased $0.16 or 7.1% year-over-year, and that\u2019s primarily due to a roughly an 8% decrease in market prices. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year with a 66% hedge for first quarter and 59% hedge for full year 2020. We\u2019ve been adding some protection to future years and are currently about 54% hedge for 2021 and about 31% hedge for 2022. We also recently began adding modest protection to 2023 and expect to continue our systematic approach to building a meaningful multi-year hedging portfolio at a reasonable cost to provide some insurance on around what\u2019s about a third of our cost structure. For our first quarter 2020, based on market prices as of January 17, we expect our fuel price to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per gallon with a modest $0.01 hedging gain at current prices. Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX groundings. We came into 2019 expecting a solid year-over-year improvement in our fuel efficiency, largely driven by the operating performance of the 75 MAX aircraft we should have had in 2019. As a reminder, the MAX produces a 20% fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14% improvement over our NG fleet. However, our fourth quarter and full year 2019 ASMs per gallon declined 0.8%. So we lost some ground last year. We\u2019ll continue to be impacted until the return of the MAX in first quarter 2020 ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the range of down 2% to 3%. We look forward to reversing this trend and getting back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal. Excluding fuel and profitsharing, the 5% year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter CASM-Ex was right in line with our most recent guidance. And as we outlined in our release, the primary driver of the year-over-year increase was the temporary underutilization of overhead combined with the lower than planned capacity from the MAX grounding. For full year 2019, our CASM-Ex increased 7.7% year-over-year. The MAX grounding impact drove approximately 5 points of this year-over-year inflation, which is what we expected. Excluding the MAX impact, our cost control was very solid with core year-over-year 2019 unit cost performance, slightly below our original CASM-Ex guidance range of 3% to 3.5%. And that includes the incremental $10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the -700 aircraft that we were originally going to retire in 2019, as well as the incremental $42 million ratification true up for mechanics contract. Looking at first quarter 2020, we expect our CASM-Ex to increase in the 6% to 8% range year-over-year. Our outlook includes an estimated 7-point unit cost penalty from the MAX grounding as our fleet deficit grows relative to our cost base. We will continue to have temporarily unabsorbed overhead that will be utilized upon the MAX return-to-service. Setting the MAX aside, our first quarter CASM-Ex outlook also includes 1 to 2 points of inflation, primarily due to increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and operating expenses related to technology and facility investments. As you know, we have year-over-year tailwinds related to the first quarter 2019 impact associated with the ratified labor agreement with our mechanics and cost associated with unscheduled maintenance disruptions and flight cancellations, which offset inflationary pressures here in the first quarter. Turning to an overview of our fleet plan, this has obviously been a focus for us this year with the MAX grounding. So I\u2019ll spend a little more time walking you through all the moving parts. Prior to the MAX groundings, our 2019 plans were for 44 MAX deliveries. That was 37 MAX 8s and seven MAX 7s along with 18 -700 retirement. This would have resulted in a fleet of 776 at year-end 2019. Instead, we had three MAX 8 deliveries plus six -700 retirements, and therefore, ended 2019 with a total fleet of 747 aircraft. We took delivery of three 737 MAX 8 aircraft in first quarter before the MAX groundings in mid-March. We have not taken any delivery since then and as a result we decided to postpone seven of the 18 planned retirements for 2019 to help mitigate a portion of our fleet deficit. We\u2019ll operate these seven aircraft for around two more years and they are scheduled retired by the end of 2021. As the remaining 11 -700 retirement plan for 2019, we retired six of them, one in third quarter and five during fourth quarter. The remaining five retirements have shifted to first half 2020. We have not updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing. The 41 MAX aircraft that we didn\u2019t receive in 2019 are still in flux. But in our contractual order book schedule shown in our earnings release this morning, we reflected 40 of those deliveries as part of our 2020 firm orders and one as a 2021 firm order. However, I will provide some context as far as our current planning assumptions, because we do not expect to receive 78 aircraft deliveries at this point in 2020. The news from Boeing two days ago that the MAX will likely not return-to-service until mid-2020 has us now reevaluating our fleet and capacity plans further. Mike has already taken you through some of the details of our MAX return-to-service plan and he referenced the two sources of MAX aircraft that we are currently focused on as part of our 2020 fleet planning assumptions. Mike is working through the plan to safely return the 34 MAX 8s already in our fleet. We will also be working with Boeing and the FAA to deliver the 27 MAX 8 aircraft that are built-in in storage. At this juncture, our current planning scenario is for 27 MAX deliveries in 2020. That brings us to around 60 MAXs, which we are currently staffed to operate. We also expect to retire 16 -700 aircraft this year. The five that shifted from 2019 and 11 more planned throughout the year. This is less than the 20 to 25 that we previously communicated and that\u2019s simply due to the slower assumed ramp up of MAX production and delivery catch-up. We will invest approximately $12 million this year into those 11 aircraft that we\u2019re extending for a few years. Based on our planning assumption that I walked through, we would add a modest 11 net aircraft to our fleet in 2020 at 758 total aircraft. Of course, we don\u2019t have certainty on the timing of the MAX return-to-service, that production timeline from Boeing or our aircraft delivery timeline. So this is all subject to change and we\u2019ll keep you updated accordingly. Shifting to capacity. Fourth quarter 2019 ASM declined 0.9% year-over-year, which as expected was about 8 points lower than our original plan. Our full year 2019 capacity declined 1.6% year-over-year and was significantly lower than our original plan to grow nearly 5% in 2019. For first quarter 2020, we currently expect our ASM capacity decline in the range of down 1.5% to 2.5% year-over-year. We currently have MAX flying removed through June 6, but with Boeing\u2019s latest guidance, we\u2019ll likely extend our MAX related flight adjustments further. So based on the flight schedule adjustments through June 6, we expect second quarter 2020 capacity to increase no more than 2%. So now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with robust cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.1 billion. Our cash balance continues to be higher than what we usually carry as we haven\u2019t been making aircraft delivery payments since mid-March 2019. Delayed delivery payments also lowered our CapEx to $1 billion in 2019 versus our original plan of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. The majority of the 2019 spend related to technology and facility investment. And we also received $400 million in supplier proceeds, which we consider an offset to our capital expenditures. For 2020, if you assume we get the 27 MAX 8s from Boeing, that are already built for us, that would result in total CapEx of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which is net of a supplier proceeds owed to us at year-end. 2019. Our cash flow generation in 2019 was very strong, despite the $828 million operating income reduction due to the MAX groundings. During 2019, we generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and a record $3.4 billion in free cash flow with $2 billion of share repurchases and $372 million in dividends. We have $1.35 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, net of the $550 million accelerated share repurchase currently underway that is expected to wrap up no later than mid-February. We have very healthy cash and liquidity, low leverage, manageable debt obligations this year and remain focused on a balanced approach to investing in our employees and the company and returning cash and value to our shareholders. In closing, I\u2019d like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees. Taking into consideration, the significant impact the MAX grounding had on our operational and financial performance. Our 2019 results were truly superb. We did not lose ground on our very strong financial position, maintaining our investment grade balance sheet, ample liquidity, strong cash flows and healthy shareholder return. And we also continue investing in our business and we\u2019re well positioned for the future. Absent the impact of the MAX groundings in first quarter of 2019 unique items, we achieved our unit revenue growth goal of greater than 3% for 2019. Likewise, we beat our unit cost guidance for 2019, which is just tremendous. Of course, the MAX did significantly impact 2019 and 2020 will also be significantly impacted by the ongoing MAX situation, but our focus on solid execution remains unchanged. We look forward to getting past these near-term challenges and temporary headwinds, safely returning the MAX to commercial service and leveraging our low cost and robust route network to resume our growth. So with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Didora : Hi, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for the questions. Tammy, it seems like you were able to offset the 1 to 2 points of inflationary pressures in 1Q partially due to some of the easier comps, I think, partially due to maybe some of your cost initiatives that you have. But going forward, do you think you have a similar ability, the rest of the year, which would allow you to keep \u2013 I guess, do you think you have a similar ability or the rest of the year to continue to offset these cost pressures and keep it more contained to what the MAX impact is? Or do you think inflation will continue to ramp over the course of the year? Thanks. Tammy Romo : Thanks for your question, Andrew. So yes, we certainly have abnormal capacity trends this year again. But as we drill down into our core costs and strip out the estimated impact of the MAX grounding and all the other noise, we do see core business unit cost inflation in that, call it, close to 2% range. That said, we don\u2019t know exactly when the MAX will return, and our second half 2020 capacity plan is very much in flux. So again, that\u2019s our best read at this point. We\u2019ve reported our analysis of the unit cost impact each quarter from the MAX groundings. So along those lines, we\u2019ve done our best to get a sense of what our true CASM-Ex run rate is from 2019 to 2020. So normalizing for the MAX and the other unique items for both 2019 and 2020, we believe we could have reached our CASM-Ex year-over-year growth in 2020 of less than 2%, which is in line with the goals. But admittedly, we have a lot of moving parts try to tease out. So I guess, in summary, I\u2019d just say, I\u2019m very pleased with how we executed against our cost plan in 2019, and we are very focused on being even more efficient. So I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume or think we should be able to improve our trajectory here in 2020 relative to 2019, excluding the MAX. But just again, including the MAX, obviously, the year-over-year comparisons are very skewed, and we\u2019re incurring costs that we didn\u2019t expect such as extending retirements and incurring the related maintenance investment and have some timing items such as deferring flight crew hiring from 2019 into 2020, et cetera. But overall, I\u2019m just really proud of our folks. They\u2019re really doing a great job with their budgets and controlling costs. And I\u2019ll add by just saying, we\u2019re all definitely looking forward to the safe return of the MAX, resuming our growth, utilizing our unabsorbed overhead and beginning to reverse the temporary unit cost penalties that we\u2019re incurring. So thank you again for your question. Andrew Didora : Great, thank you for that detail Tammy. And then maybe my second question just for Gary or for Mike. Look, I know it\u2019s difficult to comment on full year capacity, given a lot of the moving pieces. But based on what Mike explained in his prepared remarks, what could growth look like once the MAX returns to service? Could it be that high single-digit growth rate that, I think, many were maybe expecting few months back? And then how does sim training change the time line for a full kind of return to optimal utilization for your fleet? Thanks. Gary Kelly : Tammy, you\u2019re probably in the best position to answer that. We \u2013 Andrew, as you know, we didn\u2019t \u2013 we purposefully did not put any guidance for the year, for the obvious reasons, but Tammy\u2026 Tammy Romo : That\u2019s right. Yes, it is tough to answer for all the reasons we\u2019ve all laid out. In terms of the second quarter, we\u2019ve given you our guidance there for ASM growth, if you strip out the \u2013 if you assume the MAX gets pushed beyond the second quarter, I just offered that probably gets you to roughly flat capacity year-over-year for the second quarter. And then really, it\u2019s just a function of the return-to-service plan. And we\u2019ve told you, we\u2019ve got a good line of sight on the 61 airplanes. Mike has walked you through the ramping of all of that, which is a several month process. And from there, it\u2019s really, I think, based on the production rates from Boeing, which we just don\u2019t know the answer to that question yet. So it\u2019s just premature to try to get what the capacity ramp-up year-over-year could be here in the second half of the year. Gary Kelly : And I think Mike pointed this out, but \u2013 so Mike, you might want to comment. But we \u2013 just to be clear, we\u2019re staffed. We\u2019re resourced. We got gates, et cetera, for 61 more airplanes. And so what we have a line of sight on is you got 34 we own, 27 that Boeing has. The issue is there are 16 retirements that are coming. So get to fill up 61 airplanes worth of flying, we\u2019d have to get 16 more beyond the 61 airplanes from Boeing. And whether we\u2019ll get those in 2020, Mike, I don\u2019t think we know. So I think that\u2019s possible. So the point that I wanted to make with that is we want to get 61 airplanes into service as fast as we can. And that is all understanding that it needs to be safe, it needs to meet all of our other objectives, et cetera. But we\u2019ll want to get to that 61 just as fast as we can. We just don\u2019t know what that speed will be. And some of it may be us. We may find that we want to gate the flow of airplanes back into the operation more than what we know right now. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight. But you can throw any percent out there you want. It\u2019s certainly not going to be 10%. There\u2019s no way. Nothing close to that. And in 2021, I got the same kinds of concerns. So we\u2019re not so worried about the percents right now through as much as you are, but we\u2019re certainly not going to be growing rapidly here in 2020. Andrew Didora : Understood. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey, good afternoon. Just a follow-up, Mike, to clarify, the color that you gave about the MAX. And I know there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty there on the return to service, but color was helpful, but make sure I understand. It sounds like including the manual updates and kind of the concurrent training and maintenance, assuming it\u2019s only a two hours, there\u2019s a lot of assumptions there. It\u2019s about four weeks from certification to \u2013 or at least four weeks from certification to when you can get the aircraft \u2013 sorry, four weeks more than the kind of two months that you have mentioned before to get the aircraft up and running. Is that right? And then also, just would you be willing to kind of train a subset of pilots if it means that you can get the MAX off the ground sooner? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. So just maybe to give you a little bit more color on that. When there were \u2013 what we were thinking about when there was \u2013 when it was just a requirement of CBT training. There\u2019s a period of time \u2013 there are really three things. There is getting the manuals approved. And so once there is a return-to-service date, we need to get the manuals. We need to get all those changes in our manuals and we have the \u2013 our CMO sign off on all that. And that could take three weeks, let\u2019s say, three to four weeks to get that done. Once that\u2019s done, we can begin executing on the plan. And the plan is twofold : to get the airplanes into their proper maintenance state, get the pilots trained. When there was just CBT training, we could get pilots trained within 30 days. Now that there is a potential for simulator training, I think that could add at least a couple of months to that date. So that is the best challenge with the CBT training. And that lays over really with the aircraft time at the same time. So that \u2013 hope that gives you a little bit of color from where we were to kind of where we are today. To be able to subset a group of pilots to bring the airplanes back earlier, we would need systems, we would need procedures, and then we would need an adjustment to our pilot contract to allow how all that works. So there\u2019s a lot of work with that. We\u2019re exploring opportunities in that area. But there is just a lot of risk and uncertainty with all of that. So that\u2019s not an easy path here. Gary Kelly : Sorry, but in the end, you match all that together and really, compared to what we were assuming before compared to simulator training and again \u2013 another shout out to CAE, who has been terrific to work with \u2013 we\u2019ll have a significant amount of simulator capacity if that\u2019s the route that we need to go and it will add a couple of months. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Gary Kelly : It did work for you. So based \u2013 and you said it, there are a lot of assumptions there, but just trying to give you some guidance. So we won\u2019t be up and running immediately after an ungrounding, it will be several months later. Mike Van de Ven : The other \u2013 and then lastly, I just want to make clear also is we will have the year before that \u2013 we\u2019re talking about revenue service there, which I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in. But before that, we\u2019re going to try \u2013 we will do validation flights out there so that we can make sure that everything that has occurred on those airplanes, they\u2019re flying, they\u2019re maintained, we\u2019ve got all the cobwebs knocked out of them for such \u2013 for a long-term storage. So we will also be \u2013 so the airplanes will be up in the air flying before them. Gary Kelly : So we can do that. In other words, without having trained our entire core of pilots. Savi Syth : Makes sense. No, that\u2019s helpful. And I think I missed the four months, though. It sounds like, roughly speaking, from time of recertifications. And then maybe Tammy, just a clarification on the kind of Boeing \u2013 the kind of lower cost that you\u2019re going to get from these compensation. Is some of that already flowing through for the aircraft that you own and are grounded today? So some of it is already reflected and that will continue to build as you go out? And then also just wondering if you can provide the breakout of the fair value for the fuel hedges between \u2013 for 2021? Tammy Romo : Sure, Savi. The \u2013 just to answer your question first on the compensation. So it\u2019s really pretty straightforward. The compensation will be allocated to the 34 aircraft that we have grounded, so we\u2019ll get some benefit of that here more immediately. And it\u2019s more for next year \u2013 or actually for this year now in the millions, call it, maybe $5 million for this year. And then\u2026 Gary Kelly : Lower depreciation expense. Tammy Romo : Lower depreciation expense. And then as we bring on the aircraft deliveries in the future, that will simply be spread over the useful life of the aircraft. So the benefit will be realized for, obviously, over many years here. So \u2013 but that\u2019s kind of short and simple explanation of how that\u2019s going to roll out. Gary Kelly : And so we don\u2019t have \u2013 for the 2020 settlement that we keep talking about, there\u2019s nothing factored into any of our\u2026 Tammy Romo : That\u2019s right. Gary Kelly : \u2026forward comments for that. So the only thing that\u2019s in 2020 is related to the deal that was done for 2019. Tammy Romo : That\u2019s correct. So thanks, Gary. And then on your second question, I guess, we laid out in terms of the fair value, the \u2013 it was $2 million for the first quarter and $31 million for the remainder. So just the way that rolls out is, in 2021, we\u2019ll call it roughly another $40 million. In 2022, it\u2019s in the same neighborhood of $40 million. And then in 2023, it\u2019s less than $10 million. Savi Syth : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hey everybody, thank you for the time. Hey Gary, you are a \"never say never\" guy, so you might not like this question, but I would challenge you. What are some things \u2013 one or two things that you think you\u2019re fairly sure Southwest will never do as long as you\u2019re CEO? And I asked this question because I\u2019m pretty curious to some like we\u2019re never going to have basic economy a month or two ago. So just \u2013 I\u2019d like to know what is in that never category as long as you\u2019re CEO? Gary Kelly : I love all your questions always. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Gary Kelly : Yes, I don\u2019t know if I can give you a comprehensive list to the nevers. And you are right, I am a \"never say never.\" But I don\u2019t see us ever charging for bag fees. And obviously, one of these days, somebody else could view that differently. We\u2019re not going to do basic economy. We\u2019ve \u2013 there\u2019s been a couple of media stories that were way off, so we\u2019ve tried to clean some of that up. But yes, we won\u2019t be doing basic economy. And I don\u2019t know, Tammy, I\u2019m sure there are some other things that we won\u2019t do. I don\u2019t see us certainly in the near future doing \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know. I was going to say something I probably shouldn\u2019t say. So I won\u2019t say it. Hunter Keay : My follow-up question then, Gary, is yes, sorry. My follow-up is please tell me what you\u2019re going to say just now. Gary Kelly : Why is it you\u2019re always asking questions. And that one, I won\u2019t answer. Hunter Keay : All right, thanks. And then just real quick, I mean, obviously, you said second fleet type decision is not for now. That\u2019s a later discussion. I get it. But can you just run me about just the CBA restrictions around adding a second fleet type? Is that a gating item for a decision to be made across multiple CBAs? Or is that something that can happen concurrently? And just sort of pragmatically order of operations with regard to your CBAs. Thanks a lot. Gary Kelly : Well, yes, we would need to collaborate with our employees and especially our pilots. I think all of it is contemplated with what Mike and I have been thinking about. Whether it\u2019s a gating factor, it needs to be collaborative. So yes, I don\u2019t know if gating is exactly the right word, but we would need to be thinking about it comprehensively. I think our pilots would be interested in supporting the company in terms of growth in the most economical manner because \u2013 so obviously, it means more jobs for them. It means more upgrades for captain. So as long as we can conclude that and then convince them that is the right case, I think we can come to an agreement on that. But Tammy and I were talking earlier this morning about this. And for us to have to arrive at a different course of action here with the fleet, we\u2019ve got to have the right timing to meet our needs in terms of additional airplanes. We\u2019ve got to have the right product, and it\u2019s got to come at the right price. So those are all three, maybe two of the three, at least, are pretty big hurdles to overcome. I think if we were to reverse this and we hadn\u2019t shared with you all that we\u2019re going to explore the risk/reward of having a single fleet type/single supplier, I think you\u2019d be asking us. This sort of illustrates the risk of having all of your eggs in one basket. So I think we have a duty to look at that. We\u2019re going to look at it very seriously. And I think we have to be realistic that this can be a hard hurdle to overcome. So I don\u2019t know, at least, Hunter, in the way I\u2019m thinking about it, I don\u2019t see the threshold question being the CBA. I think the threshold question is does this make sense for us or not. And if it does, well, then you sort of knocked down the other barriers that are out there. But our pilots are great. They\u2019re fantastic, and I certainly don\u2019t see that as a \"hurdle\" or obstacle. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you, Gary. Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. Operator : The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : So you\u2019re seeing there\u2019s a chance for hot meals? Gary Kelly : How did you know? Jamie Baker : That\u2019s what I heard. Yes, sorry. I respect the confidentiality around the Boeing settlement. So let\u2019s focus on 2020, which has not been settled. How do you calculate or try to calculate the impact? Do you merely look at a pre-shutdown business plan and compare it to actual results? Do you focus on some trailing pretax margin calculus? Do you make adjustments for the fact that your growth-abled competitors now we\u2019ll have over a year\u2019s jump in certain markets, and it\u2019s going to cause something to win that share back? I\u2019m not asking about what you and Boeing might settle on. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about what your entitlement is. Gary Kelly : Well, I think it\u2019s a very fair question. I don\u2019t know that \u2013 you know and we know that this is a negotiation. This is not contractual. This is a negotiation. So I don\u2019t see being selfish about this. I don\u2019t see a lot of merit or wisdom and is laying out our entire strategy about this. I also don\u2019t want to give our competitors a road map. What I don\u2019t \u2013 if you just simply talk about the harm that the company has incurred. I wouldn\u2019t quarrel with anything that you put out there, and as I mentioned in my remarks, there\u2019s a lot of years, Jamie, where we\u2019ve had a dozen issues that we needed to deal with. And right now, we\u2019ve been blessed with having one. The operation is fantastic, and I won\u2019t tick through everything that the four of us have been trying to drive home today. But the company is in a really, really good shape. We have one problem, and it\u2019s a serious one. And the sitting here dog paddling for a year while our competitors grow right past us is costing us this year 6 million, 7 million customers. And yes, I\u2019m very worried about that. And that\u2019s not anything that we can mitigate. We can deal with the operation. We can deal with all these other things, we get the finances whole, so to speak. But that, we can\u2019t do anything about until we get airplanes, until we can grow again. And it\u2019s \u2013 so \u2013 and I do I think we\u2019ve been harmed? Absolutely. And everybody knows we\u2019re going to seek compensation from Boeing. And I\u2019ll just \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll just put a period on it. Jamie Baker : Okay. Sure, sure. That helps. I appreciate it. When I think about MAX-impacted airlines around the globe, you\u2019re clearly one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable. So put differently, other customers are desperate to get MAXs. There\u2019s no doubt that you want them. But as you point out, it\u2019s not like your margins have collapsed. So as Boeing jiggers around the skyline, would Southwest have any interest in letting some of your delivery slots go to the needy, for lack of a better term? Or is it mandatory that you get what you\u2019re entitled to as fast as humanly possible? Gary Kelly : It\u2019s somewhat philosophical, I assume, but I think this is a really good company. And I think part of the reason that we\u2019re able to absorb the blow is because of five decades worth of preparation. And we went through 9/11, and I can vividly remember our competitors whining about their state, and that was their fault they weren\u2019t prepared for the unexpected, without trying to be too harsh here. But we shouldn\u2019t be penalized because we have run a great company for five decades taking care of all of our constituents, especially our shareholders. We shouldn\u2019t be penalized further for that. I wouldn\u2019t be serving all of our stakeholders today if we simply said, \" Oh, well, because we\u2019re not on the verge of collapse, we should forfeit these positions.\" That makes no sense to me. So no, I wouldn\u2019t do that at all. I would say quite the contrary. I think that Boeing has benefited and the 737 program has benefited mightily because of Southwest Airlines and our success over five decades. Jamie Baker : Very clear. Thank you, Gary. Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. Operator : And the next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Understand estimates are exactly that, and I think we understand how you get your arms around the cost impact from the MAX being out. But just for argument\u2019s sake, how do you estimate the RASM benefit? As I think about some of the hard choices you\u2019ve had to make, cutting your worst flying, focusing on your best and combined with basically no capacity growth, it feels like the RASM benefit could be very, very substantial. So for example, in the fourth quarter in the press release, I think you called out 2 to 3-point tailwind from the MAX being grounded. What does that compare to? Like what would capacity growth have been? And how do you get to that number? Gary Kelly : Well, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right, there are estimates. And I think, by definition, it\u2019s sort of a with and without, and you don\u2019t know what it \u2013 and we admit, we don\u2019t know exactly what life would have been like with 75 more airplanes as of the end of the year. But I think our folks through \u2013 Tom, through the year has been consistent in pointing out that, yes, we\u2019re not growing capacity and arguably, there\u2019s some benefit from that, at least temporarily. But the way we\u2019ve had to reproduce schedules has been grossly inefficient and put our revenue management in a really tough position. Because we\u2019re not building up bookings in a normal way, and we\u2019re re-accommodating people at low prices, the fourth quarter, of course, was unique with the \u2013 gosh, over 3% was added back for lack of precision in the scheduling, so it was wholly inefficient in the fourth quarter. So anyway, I think that we\u2019ve laid all of that out, and it\u2019s, at most, in the quarters \u2013 in quarters two, quarters three and quarters one of 2020, it might be 2 points. In quarter four, I think, it\u2019s 0 because it was wholly offset by having a very inefficient schedule. So I think that answers your question. Tammy, I don\u2019t know if you or Tom any differently than I did. Tom Nealon : No, I just agree to the things you said. I do think this, I think if you just start with the fundamentals, the trends that we saw in Q4 just flowing into Q1. And even if you take them \u2013 I\u2019m not giving guidance on Q2, by the way, but if you begin to look at the early piece of Q2, the trends just continue to look pretty solid. So the fundamentals are good. I think go back to the MAX out of our 2019 performance, we still have performed really, really well. Not mistaken, there\u2019s about 1 point to MAX RASM benefit. So you back that out, we\u2019re still in the 3% range. I think if you look at 2020, I think it will be a little more modest than that, but we still have strong positive growth. I think what\u2019s interesting is what we can\u2019t lose sight of. I\u2019ll tell you what the problem I\u2019d love to have is a huge capacity plan coming against we have a RASM to deal with, right. So we need to grow, right. But don\u2019t misunderstand, we are still flying a very, very strong schedule. In fact, just the 2020 base schedule \u2013 April base schedule has more than 4,000 daily flights, 4,016 to be precise. And that\u2019s in comparison to last year\u2019s 4,078. So we still have \u2013 and these are little factoids that I want you guys know because we still have a very, very strong schedule. And what\u2019s also interesting is \u2013 and Mike and I and the operations and commercial teams are very, very tightly linked on this whole RTS thing. I mean, literally daily, right, going through this stuff. And what I do know is, as Mike and the operations team sort through the reality and the information becomes clearer and clearer, it\u2019s really up to them to tell us when the capacity is available. And the reason I\u2019d say that is, it\u2019s not unusual at all for us in normal circumstances as we move between schedules from high utilization or low utilization or vice versa. It\u2019s not unusual at all for us to flex up 40, 50 aircraft at a time, all right? So our work in terms of building the MAX back in from a commercial standpoint, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but we know where we put it back in. So it\u2019s going to be governed by how fast are the aircraft coming back into service. And then we\u2019ll just balance the three things we keep talking about : operational stability, financial results and customer. But I think the base trends are solid. We know how to put the capacity back in. In fact, you can see where we put it back in since you can see where we took it out. So I think we\u2019re ready to go once Mike says, okay, here\u2019s the aircraft. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for that. And then thinking ahead optimistically to that maybe someday where you\u2019re spooling back up for growth what\u2019s spending, if any \u2013 and I\u2019m talking OpEx here, not CapEx, have you deferred as you wait around the basket for Boeing to get its act together? Thanks for taking the questions. Gary Kelly : On the \u2013 and I heard you clearly there, just another opportunity for me to reinforce. We have not deferred \u2013 and you all correct me. We haven\u2019t deferred any of our capital projects. So we\u2019ve got a lot of investment underway in airports around the country. We just opened up a maintenance hangar in Houston. We\u2019ve got other hangars that we\u2019re working on, a lot of technology efforts. So all of that continues. On the OpEx side, we\u2019re not burning the fuel. We sort of stopped the hiring at the fleet plan that we\u2019ve shared with you all. So we\u2019re suspending a lot of our hiring other than attrition. And again, none of that is suboptimized. And even with that, again, the results are quite strong. But beyond that, Mike, I can\u2019t think of any \u2013 advertising flops around here. We\u2019re going to obviously support the reintroduction of the MAX at the appropriate time, so you have things like that. But otherwise, I can\u2019t \u2013 unless, you have something specific that you were probing on. I can\u2019t think of anything that you all should expect that will be a large expenditure, except for the marketing and the messaging and those kinds of things. And I\u2019ll leave it up to you how you want to\u2026 Tammy Romo : Yes. And then there\u2019s timing maybe from quarter-to-quarter in terms of maintenance, but all of that, I think, we\u2019ve got a good handle on and can manage. So no, we feel like the costs are in good shape. And other than that, it\u2019s just unique to the return-to-service of the MAX, storage cost, that sort of thing. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I just have two questions. One is, Gary, have you talked to your pilots or anybody in the team talked to the pilots about the potential of wet leasing aircraft on an absolutely short-term basis to get through this to pick up some of those lost passengers? And my second question is, as you think about shifting from long-haul to short-haul flying, do you worry about what people will say about climate change and whether or not you\u2019re being a good steward of the environment? So thanks very much for the time. Gary Kelly : Well, Mike, I\u2019ll take them both, and you can chime in here. On the first one, Helane, to be honest with you, with our executive team, we have not spent any time exploring the opportunity for wet leasing. So since we haven\u2019t talked about it, no, we haven\u2019t talked with anybody else in the company. We\u2019re focused on the retirement plan, and then we\u2019re always tuned into the used market. I think that makes the most sense because you just think about the effort involved trying to work with a third party and all the complexities that, that would bring. It\u2019s not going to be in our configuration. We\u2019ve got a unique business model, et cetera, et cetera. It\u2019s \u2013 everything is sort of predicated on agreeing with our assumption that this is a short-lived issue and not something that we deal with for years. So as long as it\u2019s months, I think we\u2019re making the right judgment. So that\u2019s an easy answer to your question. You may not agree with it, but it\u2019s \u2013 but I think we can give you an accurate answer. And then on the short versus the long, we\u2019re a short-haul specialist. And we\u2019ve got more short-haul customers than anybody else in the country and arguably more short-haul flights. So the only point I\u2019m making with that is what we\u2019re tweaking here in 2019, because of this is not fundamentally changing our long/short mix at all. We\u2019re still very, very heavily weighted with the short-haul flights. With respect to our concern about that, yes, I think we\u2019re concerned about sustainability. And I was asked on CNBC about that this morning, and we are very focused on conservation, on fuel economy. The MAX is front and center in terms of addressing that. It\u2019s important to get that airplane back in service, because it consumes 15% less gas. We need the air traffic control system modernized. And I think the most tangible thing our industry needs to accomplish over the next 10 years, is commercially viable alternative fuels at adequate supplies and at reasonable prices. And that would make a very significant impact. Carbon offsets are all great. But in my own opinion, there\u2019s only so much offsetting the world can do. And eventually, we need to get it consuming less emissions. But if you look at air transportation relative to other alternatives, it compares very, very well. And so certainly, I don\u2019t see any challenge to our short-haul business anytime soon, if ever, especially if we continue to improve our carbon footprint as we have been doing. Helane Becker : Great. Thank you very much for those answers. I appreciate your time. Operator : It appears we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the time. Gary, I think if we go back before, I recall was sort of dominated by the MAX, you guys had laid out a vision for implementing some revenue initiatives that you were very excited about. Have you guys had to delay the time line or introduction of any of those initiatives as you\u2019ve been kind of focusing on managing through the fleet deficit? Or is the \u2013 and we should expect those to kind of come on as the MAX returns? Or has there been no change to the time line on the commercial stuff? Gary Kelly : No, sir. There\u2019s been no change on that. In fact, I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t recall a change that we\u2019ve made because of the MAX with any of it. And again, I\u2019m lumping that in as a capital project. Given the fact that there is a financial penalty associated with the MAX, it sort of encourages to maybe accelerate some of these revenue and other cost initiatives. And Tammy made this point, but one of our cost initiatives is fleet modernization. And what that means, at least for 2019, 2020 is the acceleration of MAXs into our fleet and the acceleration of retiring some of the older technology. And obviously, we\u2019re not in a position to take advantage of that cost optimization opportunity right now. There was a question earlier about cost inflation. So we\u2019ll have a little penalty because of that here in the next year or so. And then hopefully, we can get back on track on getting more MAXs in as a percentage of the mix. But except for that, I can\u2019t think of anything that has been deferred. Certainly, as a headline, we\u2019ve asked our officers to execute their plans and execute them well and get them deployed and will start driving the value, especially on the revenue side. David Vernon : Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, Tammy, the supplier proceeds number of 400, is that associated with the MAX payments? Or what exactly is that when you think about the cash flow numbers in the earnings release? Tammy Romo : The \u2013 all I can really say there is, it\u2019s supplier proceeds. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the agreement with Boeing is confidential. David Vernon : Okay. So we will draw our own\u2026 Tammy Romo : And just to be clear, we do consider that effectively an offset of CapEx. And I think we\u2019ve made that clear as well. Gary Kelly : And it is a reporting requirement that it would be broken out that way. And I think we would admit that with the Boeing agreement, it makes it material enough that now it is a line item without describing what suppliers are in that line item. David Vernon : And as you think about the cash that might be created from this supplier proceeds category. Would this be cash that you\u2019d be keeping on hand to fund future requirements? Or would this be something that you might accelerate into the buyback? Tammy Romo : We will be looking at all of that. I\u2019ll just point back to the statements that I made earlier, which is we\u2019ll continue to take a balanced approach to our capital deployment. And I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve used all of those. So again, I\u2019ll just repeat, we\u2019re going to continue investing in the business, at least at this point. We have no intention to slow down reinvestments back in the business. And I think our track record speaks to our goal to also take care of our shareholders. So we\u2019ll just continue to take a balanced approach to all of that, as always. Gary Kelly : And I would just state the obvious, which is it is always better to have more cash. Tammy Romo : I love cash. Gary Kelly : Because there\u2019s lots of options. Tammy Romo : Gary knows, we love cash. David Vernon : Thanks a lot guys. Ryan Martinez : Thank you. Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you all for joining us. And as always, feel free to give us a call, if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Chad, thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome the members of the media to our call today. We\u2019ll go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion. So Chad, if you could just give them instructions on how to queue up, we\u2019ll get started. Operator : Sure. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Kyle Arnold : Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about why you want to get that $124 million profitsharing payment out to employees this year? And whether as you go forward and negotiate with Boeing and move in to 2020, whether you\u2019re going to look any kind of similarly for employees? Gary Kelly : Well, Kyle, I think it\u2019s really easy. It\u2019s \u2013 we knew, we were going to settle with Boeing. We also were quite sure that the settlement would not flow through earnings in terms of the classic definition of profits for profitsharing and that \u2013 and you just put yourself an employee position here. So if you\u2019re here as an employee in 2019 and you may not be here for the next 30 to 40 years when this benefit is realized, then you\u2019re harmed. You\u2019ll never see the benefit of that, and we actually got a settlement from Boeing. So it was \u2013 all of that was anticipated. We shared that early on that we were going to work to sell with Boeing, and we have a precedent over decades of making amendments to the contribution to do what\u2019s right for our people, and that\u2019s either plus or minus, for that matter. So going way back to 9/11 and then the government subsidies that were offered up, we paid profitsharing on that, and it did not strictly meet the definition of profits for profitsharing. So long history of doing things like that. And it was a great year. It would have easily been a record year. It was actually a record year even though we had these penalties. And I\u2019m just delighted that we can do that. So \u2013 and so was our board, they were delighted to do it for our people. Kyle Arnold : And are you going to look for more compensation back to employees as you continue negotiating with Boeing? Gary Kelly : This is simply a question of how to treat the settlement for profitsharing purposes, period. And we will certainly do in 2020, attempt to do in 2020, while we were able to accomplish with Boeing in 2019. Kyle Arnold : Thanks. Operator : And the next question will be from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, you mentioned that there have been a couple \u2013 just in the last couple of weeks, a few things that are Boeing that been surprising or unexpected big changes to sort of the assumptions that you\u2019ve had. And I was wondering if you could say whether \u2013 how you think, things have changed under their new leadership, what\u2019s improved and what hasn\u2019t, what you\u2019re still looking for? Gary Kelly : I think it\u2019s way too early. Boeing has been unstable since March of last year, and this is part of the instability. You\u2019ve got a new CEO. You\u2019ve got a new CEO of the commercial organization. So it\u2019s far too early to make an assessment there. Now, both of the \u2013 as you and I have talked, we know all of us know, Stan deal, I think a lot of him. And some of us know Dave Calhoun and think a lot of him. So\u2026 Alison Sider : Great. Now if I could ask one follow-up. Just curious, as you sort of look ahead to return-to-service, curious if you\u2019ve thought at all if there\u2019s any consideration of sort of discounting MAX flights if that\u2019s something we\u2019re likely to see or if that\u2019s not on the table as a possibility? Gary Kelly : I\u2019ll let Tom speak to that. But I don\u2019t think that we would approach it in the way you described it, but you want to talk about how you\u2019re thinking about reintroducing it to service? Tom Nealon : Honestly, we\u2019ve done a lot of research on this, right? So Alison, I think that one of the things that is interesting is we are very, very, very focused on the MAX as you are. What\u2019s interesting is the general population is nowhere near zeroed in on this whole topic as we are in the industry. So we are doing a lot of work. We understand the customer perceptions there. So our customers that we talk to and non-customers, they are \u2013 it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s really kind of a bell curve. I think I shared this with you at one point. It\u2019s kind of a bell curve, and the vast majority of that bell curve is we intend to fly the same as we\u2019ve always flown. And then you have the ends of the bell curve. And actually, the two ends, one end skews higher, and that\u2019s we intend to fly more of the 737 MAX, the proof or the thought being it\u2019s actually be the safest airplane out there, while it\u2019s scrutiny and then some portion to say we\u2019re going to fly less. But I think we\u2019re going to see the customers come back pretty nicely. Some may take a little longer than others, and maybe a month or two months, but they\u2019re going to come back. And at this point, there\u2019s no notion of discounting MAX flights. That\u2019s not in our consideration set at this point. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Evan Hoopfer with Dallas Business Journal. Please go ahead. Evan Hoopfer : Good afternoon, everybody. I just had a quick question for you regarding the potential renaming of the 737 MAX. Gary, I think you said last year that, that is something that you would not be interested in. I\u2019m just wondering, consumer sentiment ever got so negative where the brand became just so toxic that you would consider that? Or is that kind of a more line in the sand that you will not cross? Gary Kelly : Well, to me, it\u2019s just a matter of being transparent. Notwithstanding, Tom\u2019s earlier comment, I think the awareness of the MAX issue is very, very high, the importance they attribute to it, I think, is where Tom has hit it. But everybody knows the name, the 737 MAX, and so who\u2019s kidding who? To me, it\u2019s just disingenuous. Now if it\u2019s a different airplane, and it\u2019s a totally different product and it would be appropriate to rename it. But this is a \u2013 ironically, it\u2019s a very minor change to a piece of software when you get right down to it, and it\u2019s Boeing\u2019s call. It\u2019s not ours. And that\u2019s what they call it. But we\u2019ve talked to them, at least the previous management team, and they weren\u2019t interested in doing that. And we certainly haven\u2019t been lobbying them to do it because I think it\u2019s just disingenuous. Evan Hoopfer : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Pilar Wolfsteller with Flight Global. Please go ahead. Pilar Wolfsteller : Hi. I\u2019ve got two questions about your Hawaii service. Number one, could you sort of talk a little bit about how successful it\u2019s been or some of your plans for the future? And the second question is do you have any comment to the reports that the FAA gave Southwest preferential treatment when it approved those routes. Gary Kelly : Well, Tom, I\u2019ll let you talk about Hawaii. I\u2019ll \u2013 since I\u2019m talking, I\u2019ll answer the second one first. Yes, we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. This is a whistleblower complaint. And we don\u2019t know who the whistleblower is. We don\u2019t know what the complaint is. So I think what I\u2019m mostly focused on \u2013 it sure didn\u2019t feel like we got preferential treatment, by the way, because we worked really hard, and they worked this really hard. But I was proud of the work that our team did. We were told going in that this is probably a 12 to 18-month effort. I think in the end, we kind of came in around 14 months, which is about what one would expect. It was \u2013 the government shutdown was in the middle of that, which hampered some of the efforts. What I\u2019m most interested in is what issues are there with our ETOPS, I\u2019m not aware of any. Our folks, I think, have done a phenomenal job developing it and then operating it on that point. So I think it\u2019s a long way of saying we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. And then, Tom, I\u2019ll let you talk about Hawaii, please? Tom Nealon : Well, I think, Hawaii, first of all, it\u2019s \u2013 keep in mind, we\u2019ve been doing this for 10 months. We\u2019ve been flying Hawaii over 10 months. It is doing phenomenal, right? So everything that we expected is at or better than our expectations. Keep in mind, it\u2019s a small piece of our business. It\u2019s right around 2%, but it has a very important role that it really supports our California business, so it\u2019s succeeding on every dimension. I think the demand and the load factors have been very, very good. We\u2019re very satisfied with that, both the long haul as well as the interisland. Our ramp up, honestly, has been a little slower than we originally expected because of the MAX and the capacity issue, but everything we put into service, we\u2019re thrilled with at this point. We are \u2013 I think this is a right of and check it, but we\u2019ve got to see, 14 daily flights in California to Hawaii across four of our big cities : Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento and San Diego. We have 38 dailies interisland. So it\u2019s doing fantastic. We\u2019re really happy with it. What\u2019s interesting is we\u2019re actually creating demand that we didn\u2019t even see as being there. So we\u2019re seeing more connecting itineraries within the West Coast, which is interesting because we\u2019re creating demand, we\u2019re growing the market and fares are lower. And what does that sound like to you? That is the classic Southwest effect. So it\u2019s happening again. And I guess, the last point and I\u2019ll be quiet here is just \u2013 I think one of the questions we were asked a lot is, this is a pretty long-haul flight. How do you feel like your product is going to perform on the long-haul flight? And by the way, it\u2019s not our longest long-haul flight. We have transcon that are longer. But having said that, the scores for the customer experience and the brand scores are actually higher than our total system, right, from the mainland to Hawaii flight. So net-net, we are very, very comfortable and thrilled where we are. Gary Kelly : Kind of a long answer to our flight attendants and the ratio as they do. Tom Nealon : Speaking real quickly to the ETOPS process, we are involved in that, and it was not a quick process, very, very thorough, and it was very, very challenging. And you look at the quality of what we\u2019re doing today, it is phenomenal. So I can\u2019t speak kind of enough of the operations team, what they\u2019ve accomplished in short period of time. Actually, it wasn\u2019t short it\u2019s 14 and 15 months to get done, by the way, which is 12 to 18 is the norm. So that is not a fast path. Gary Kelly : But Mike, at this point, no one from the FAA has come to you on any issues with ETOPS, I think? Mike Van de Ven : No, no. Like Gary said, it was a whistleblower complaint, I don\u2019t really know a lot about it. Just getting an ETOPS authorization, that is automatic. And there\u2019s a rigorous approach to that. There are advisory circulars at the FAA layoff. You take that and you follow it. We did that. And over a 14-month period, have pretty good procedures in place. After you start flying, you\u2019re in a heightened surveillance period for six months. We\u2019ve had over 3,000 flights since we started service there. And the indications are the procedures that we were authorized to perform were performing, we\u2019re executing very well. And they\u2019re doing exactly what the FAA and Southwest Airlines expected them to do. Gary Kelly : So it\u2019s all a surprise to us. And again, if there are issues, we want to know what they are, and we would be happy to address them. But right now, we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about. Pilar Wolfsteller : Thanks. Operator : It appears that we have time for one last question today, and that question comes from David Slotnick with Business Insider. Please go ahead. David Slotnick : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering, because you were talking about the \u2013 I think you said nine full flight simulators by the end of 2020. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your future hiring plans once the MAX is ungrounded, really over the next 10 years. I know that the simulators represent a big investment. So sort of wondering how that fits into the whole thing? Gary Kelly : You want to talk about that, Mike? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Yes, David. So we have \u2013 as we bring airplanes into the fleet, we hire a certain number of pilots and flight attendants for the airplanes that we bring into the fleet. And so that\u2019s there\u2019s just the math that we go through and we do that. The other thing that influences our pilot hiring are retirements. And so we\u2019ve got probably around 300 to 400, and it grows every year as we age the 300 to 400 pilots that go through retirement. And then so we are adding our pilot hiring with \u2013 to replace retirements and the airplane to come out of the fleet. But as Gary mentioned, we\u2019ve got \u2013 if we don\u2019t have production airplanes from Boeing this year, we\u2019ll only have 45 net new airplanes this year, and we\u2019re already staffed up to 61. So we don\u2019t need a lot of additional hiring in 2019. And let\u2019s just start ramping up beginning in 2020 as the delivery process from Boeing resumes. Gary Kelly : But we do plan to grow. We plan to grow and we\u2019re up to 15 to 20 airplanes a year. And we plan to hire thousands of people every year. So even in recessionary times in our history, we\u2019ve been able to grow and not shrink. Obviously, we \u2013 some years, we might grow less. But for the most part, 2009 may be an exception to that. But yes, we definitely plan to grow and continue to hire. David Slotnick : Great. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. If you all have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to our communications group, 214-792-4847 or via our online newsroom at www.swamedia.com. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines' First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thanks, Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. We're going to start out with prepared remarks from Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. And then, of course, we'll open it up for Q&A. A few quick disclaimers before we get started. We will make forward-looking statements in our remarks, which are based on our current expectations of future performance. And of course, our actual results could differ from current expectations for a number of reasons. We called out special items in first quarter 2020, and we'll make reference to those results that compare to prior year GAAP results. Both of these topics are covered in our earnings release disclosures as well as on the IR website. Today, we issued a press release announcing underwritten public offerings of our common stock and convertible notes. We cannot discuss those offerings on this call, and we won't be taking questions about them. We will, however, discuss our current liquidity position, cash burn and related topics, and we'll take questions about those and other topics as always.  So with that, we'll go ahead and get started, and I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings call. It's all about COVID-19 effects, of course, our route system is over 95% domestic. We had a very strong January and February performance with solid unit revenue growth and better-than-expected cost performance. Earnings were higher in each month year-over-year. Our operation was performing magnificently. That's in terms of on-time performance and baggage handling, and our customer service scores were industry-leading. We saw no COVID-19 effects on bookings until the end of February and the effects on bookings and cancellations and traffic beginning in March were unprecedented and quite frankly, breathtaking. So here we are. One of Southwest's greatest and most enduring strengths is its preparedness, and we were prepared. On the heels of last year's outstanding performance, and despite the MAX grounding and the excellent momentum that continued into January, February, we're in a very strong and healthy position when the coronavirus struck. We started the year and March with a surplus of liquidity and that was by well over $1 billion. We began this year with the smallest amount of debt to total capital in our history, only 24%. And on a $27 billion balance sheet, we had over $10 billion of unencumbered aircraft. While no one anticipated this economic catastrophe, we were prepared. In my time and Tammy, we'll detail all the actions taken since March 1. But in summary, including spending cuts, schedule reductions, fuel price declines and the elimination of shareholder returns, we reduced our planned spending for 2020 by over $6 billion. Excluding working capital changes and proceeds from the payroll support program of the CARES Act, our cash burn for April is roughly $900 million, and that includes CapEx and debt service. Our goal will be to drive that lower in May and June through more aggressive schedule cuts and hopefully increasing revenues. The pure cash outflows or spending has been cut in half from pre-COVID levels. Our financial management philosophy has always been and will continue to be very conservative. It has served us well, and no one can match the track record of profitability or the financial position of Southwest Airlines. No one has served shareholders or bondholders better over the last 49 years, and we intend to continue that record.  Cash in this environment is an asymmetrical risk. Not enough, that is a huge problem. Too much, we'll pay down debt or we'll buy available assets opportunistically.  We're in a recession. And historically, it has taken years, typically 5 or more, for business travel to recover. With some businesses issuing no travel orders, that has to be the expectation going forward that business travel will recover very slowly. Further, this recession has already put tens of millions of Americans out of work, and consumer sentiment has been severely damaged. That will also affect near-term travel demand expectations.  And finally, for those who are willing and able to travel, the country needs to open back up. So there's something for people to do when they get there. So I mentioned all of this to underscore the imperative of low cost in this environment because every traveler will demand a low fare. That's our business model, and we're America's strongest and most successful low fare carrier.  We're working on a variety of things : number one, strategic plans that are based on three basic recovery scenarios and is being led by our President, Tom Nealon. We're working on customer experience modifications at the airport and on the airplane to ensure that customers feel safe. We're working on our capital structure and liquidity needs to see us through this pandemic so that we emerge healthy and strong.  We're obviously working on the fleet, and that's being led by our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. And then last, we're working on early retirement and other voluntary exit or reduced work programs for our employees.  So before I pass to Mike, I want to thank all of our employees. This has been a crisis unprecedented in our history, but our people are battle-hardened. They are resilient. And they are fearless, and they have done a masterful job running the airline, serving our customers and implementing myriad new procedures and protocols, and they are all vital to this company. And they are essential to our country, and they are my heroes. I'm very grateful to our employees, and I'm very grateful to our leaders for keeping Southwest strong. And with that, Mike, I'll hand it over to you, sir. Michael Van de Ven : Well, thanks, Gary. And I really appreciate your comments about our people. They really are tenacious and to lean into this kind of headwind and deal with their own personal uncertainty and angst is just, frankly, amazing. And they're steadfast, they're fearless, and I just couldn't be more proud to be a part of this team.  Now as you mentioned, the year began really with our best overall January and February operations that we've had in probably over a decade. And all the critical operating measures of on-time performance or bag handling and the lowest ratio of customer complaints to the DOT, we were in the top 2 for the industry in each measure. And we are realizing the efficiencies of various technology and equipment investments that we had made previously to be able to execute our schedule and recover from regular operations. And those investments proved to be invaluable in March, and they allowed us to rapidly adjust our network and our crewing and our maintenance plans as we reacted to the COVID-19 demand changes. And I think they're going to be great assets for our NOC to minimize our daily operating costs as we move forward.  So when the year started, the MAX return to service plan was one of our primary focus points. Now our operations focus is threefold : first, ensuring that our environment is safe for our employees and customers; second, rapidly adapting our daily operations to whatever existing conditions are out there; and third, managing our fleet. And as we prepare and position the operation to support, hopefully, an eventual business recovery.  So we're managing through all that coordination through our emergency response program, and that is led by one of our emergency directors, our Senior VP of Operations and Hospitality, Steve Goldberg, and he is doing a tremendous job. He has 53 teams across the company working together on a daily basis to manage the crisis. And it's coordinated and it's focused with intentional efforts and deliveries that are -- that span specifically across 30, 60 and 90-day time frames. The highest priority is ensuring that we create an environment for both our employees and our customers that introduces whatever additional mitigation techniques and strategies are needed to minimize the spread of this virus.  We've implemented social distancing procedures throughout the operation where feasible. We've added voluntary temperature checks, and our employees have access to adequate masks and wipes and hand sanitizers while at work. We're in the process of adding a plexiglass face guard shields for our ticket counter gate and our cargo agent positions.  In terms of aircraft cleaning, we have an enhanced overnight cleaning process that includes wiping down all high-use areas in the cabin and the galleys and the cockpit with a hospital-grade disinfectant. In addition to that, each month, every aircraft receives an additional application of a disinfectant through the use of an electrostatic mister and as well as an application of an anti-microbial mist, and that covers all the surface of the aircraft. So those procedures provide protection for up to 30 days against virus contamination. And then, lastly, we're in the process of adding additional cleaning procedures during the turn, and we expect to have those in place within the next 30 days. We're using social distancing techniques for customers during the boarding process and while on board, and we've eliminated our in-cabin service to further mitigate risk. So in short, we will be ready to support our employees and our customers' needs as travel begins to rebound. As we move into May, the disruptions that we've experienced associated with all the various state-by-state travel restrictions, some of the international restrictions and then the ATC closures have been abating. Our published flight schedule is about 1,400 flights a day, and our focus is on running the most cost-effective operation. We can be very flexible with the tools I mentioned earlier. And we have the ability to look out 4-plus days with respect to bookings and demand, and we can easily reaccommodate customers, while simultaneously reducing our flight activity further. So the goal there is to minimize our cash burn further and that comes in the form of a reduction in fuel and landing fees and engine flight costs. The really -- the only drawback is that those cancellations in the near term, they count against the published DOT on time arrival statistics. But that hasn't really concerned me given the cash savings. And actually, the fact that the on-time performance on the flights that we do operate, they're averaging in the mid- to upper-90s each day. That significant reduction in-flight activity has left us with excess aircraft.  So we're managing through that through a combination of long-term storage and parking programs. So with respect to the storage program, we've moved 106 NG aircraft into a long-term storage program. And combining those with our 34 MAX as we have 140 aircraft in long-term storage. The additional NG aircraft were selected based on their age and the proximity to an upcoming significant heavy maintenance requirement. So for those aircraft in long-term storage, it will take a minimum of 3 or 4 days of time and probably more to bring each of those aircraft current with respect to their maintenance programs before they can be reintroduced into the active fleet. We have about 250 NGs in short-term parking programs that rotate in and out of active flying and the benefits of the short-term parking program is that the aircraft do remain part of the active fleet, and it's more cost-effective in terms of storage costs and the long-term storage program. When it is time to bring the aircraft back into published flying schedules, our most cost-effective aircraft to fly is the MAX. It has less fuel burn. It's got lower engine and maintenance costs. And there's not much to update on the MAX since our January earnings call. Based on Boeing's latest update on the MAX return to service and given the maintenance and the pilot training requirements, it will take at least a couple of months before those aircraft are ready to fly revenue service. So the MAX isn't included in any of our published flight schedules at this point. And just as a reminder, Boeing has 27 aircraft in the Southwest Airlines configuration in their storage facilities. So wrapping up, we've offered our employees voluntary extended leaves, to be home with their families if needed, through August. And many of our operations employees are taking advantage of these programs and they're helping the company out in a big, big way.  We're exploring additional early out and further extended time-off options. Our highest priority is the safety of our employees and customers as they work and travel. We are actively managing our daily operational activity to take care of our customers at our lowest cost profile, and we have 390 aircraft in some form of a storage or a parking program to reduce cost, and we have a great partner in Boeing, really, to manage our fleet plans in this time of uncertainty. We literally are at war with COVID-19, and we are really blessed to have a ferocious group of warriors that are ready to fight. And they really do inspire me every day.  And so with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you. Thomas Nealon : All right. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. So I also want to start by -- you got to acknowledge our team, our people. So I want to thank all of our employees, especially all of our frontline employees who are out in the airports, our ground operations folks at our maintenance hangers and our call centers and our NOC, our network operations center. And of course, a special thanks to our flight attendants and pilots that are on the planes every day taking care of our customers. Honestly, you guys are all truly amazing. And the respect and the admiration that I have for each of you really is indescribable. What you're doing is heroic. I just want to say thank you for all you're doing. And that's very, very genuine. I really mean that to you guys.  And by all accounts, the first quarter started off, as Gary and Mike kind of indicated already, it started off very much as we expected. Demand and pricing were both strong. We had very solid loads in our January and February and March bookings and RASM as well as capacity, were very much in line with our expectations. So we had a lot of confidence in our RASM guidance of being up 3.5% to 5.5% for the quarter. We always talk about our RAP Rewards program, and it was also doing very, very well. Consumer spending on our co-brand cards was very strong in January and February. On a card member business, spend was at record levels and was up double digits year-over-year. So great performance there. And our customer satisfaction scores, which are always the very top of the industry, we're also at record levels for both January and February, with both months being up double digits versus our internal targets, which are very stringent targets. So phenomenal how the quarter was shaping up.  And obviously, everything changed very dramatically and very quickly. And beginning in late February, we began to see a direct impact from COVID-19. Now at that point, as Gary said, our bookings were still holding up relatively well, but we did begin to see a significant increase in cancellations, and this continued to accelerate into March. Now by March 9, the situation had escalated dramatically. Cancellations began to exceed new bookings, and this continued to grow into a massive spike in trip cancellations. We ended the month of March with cancellations being up over 500% year-over-year, which resulted in a never-before-seen trend of net negative bookings.  So as demand collapsed and cancellations grew, we did what you would expect, we began to reduce our flights. And for the back half of March, we ended up canceling 34% of our roughly 3,800 daily flights. And for the full month of March, our capacity declined 17% year-over-year. Now just to give some perspective of how rapidly and how deeply demand dropped off, even with a 34% reduction of flights in the back half of March, our load factors fell steadily to single digits by the last week of the month, and that's where they are today. Our March operating revenue dropped nearly 50% year-over-year. And of course, our ancillary and other revenues dropped off dramatically as well. And as you'd expect, we're also experiencing lower partner revenue from Chase as the credit card portfolios are seeing reduced spending and lower acquisitions, none of which is a surprise in this environment. So for the first quarter, our RASM performance was a negative 11.8%, and our revenue was $4.2 billion, which is off our expectations by just over $1 billion. Now at this point, with a lot of the countries still sheltering in place and many states continuing to have some level of travel restrictions in place, we're continuing to see record low passenger demand and revenue trends here in April and May, with operating revenue down roughly 90% to 95% year-over-year and single-digit load factors. At this point, it is very, very tough to predict exactly how and when we'll see trends turn around.  So we're staying focused on those things that we can control and that we can manage to. So we have control of our flight schedule. And we have control over the quality of our operation, as Mike alluded to. And we continue to have the highest customer and brand scores in the industry, and that's all because of the people of Southwest Airlines.  So shifting now to second quarter capacity. Our April capacity was down 50% for the first two weeks of the month and will be down roughly 70% for the last 2 weeks of the month. The full month of May is published down in the range of 60% to 70% compared with pre-COVID schedules. And June capacity is currently down right around 50%.  For May and June, we've also shortened our operating day. By removing many of our flights before 7 a.m. and after 8 p.m. So we've pulled our shoulder flying in. We've also restructured service across our network while maintaining service to all of our domestic cities, including 5 Hawaii markets, by the way, and we've been able to preserve over 80% of the itineraries that were available in the prior flight schedules. The capacity reductions that I just mentioned will show up in republished schedules, but we'll also continue to manage capacity tactically and closer in based on demand. And this is being managed jointly by our network planning team and our network operations center. This is a day-to-day, week-to-week, very fluid situation, and we'll continue to make tactical capacity and schedule decisions as we need to. Changing gears a bit -- quite a bit. Our last call, I gave a quick update on our GDS initiative, which you might recall is focused on growing our share of the corporate travel market. When we announced last week that we'll be going live on May 4 with travel ports Apollo and Worldspan GDS platforms, which means that all of our everyday low-fare content will now be available with industry standard ticketing and settlement capabilities. In response, the travel management companies and corporate travel managers across the country has been absolutely phenomenal, and we're excited about what this means for us and for our customers.  So from a corporate travel perspective, in spite of COVID, it is full speed ahead, and we will be in a strong position as business travel begins to come back. It's going to take some time, but it will come back, and we'll take more than our share. So I'm going to wrap up by saying this. Without a doubt, Southwest came into the situation as the most well-prepared U.S. airline, and this will very likely reshape the industry to a degree that's not yet clear. But we have a lot of reasons to be confident that Southwest will come out of this very strong and we'll be ready to compete aggressively in the new normal environment.  So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : All right. Thank you, Tom. I'm happy to round out today's comments with a discussion on our costs, liquidity and fleet, before we move to Q&A. With our revenue production dramatically off trend, as Tom just covered, we are clearly focused on controlling our cost and preserving cash. I want to commend our employees for their quick work to rally together to reshape our cost trajectory in the near term. I'd also like to take a very quick moment to recognize our finance teams, legal teams, governmental affairs teams, commercial and operations teams, really, all Southwest teams for their tireless efforts over the past weeks. Today's rapidly changing environment calls for rapidly evolving financial scenarios and forecasts and actions. And our people have risen to the task day after day and often night after night. They are truly warriors in the face of this significant challenge, and I want to sincerely thank them for their continued efforts. Our first quarter unit cost trends illustrate how diligent we have been to reduce cost quickly. Despite first quarter capacity declining nearly 7% year-over-year, which was 5 to 6 points lower than we previously expected, first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, increased only 5.1% year-over-year. For March alone, we were able to save approximately $100 million in non-fuel cost based on self-help measures despite roughly 75% of our cost structure being fixed due to the sudden fall off in demand, coupled with closing capacity reduction. We saved another roughly $150 million in first quarter from less gallons consumed and the falling fuel prices, with roughly half of those savings coming from fewer gallons. In second quarter, capacity is expected to be down at least 60%. And we are estimating operating expenses to be down around 35%, both versus original expectations prior to the pandemic. If you factor in the benefit from the fuel price decline, costs are expected to be down nearly 40% in second quarter versus plan. So between our variable cost relief and self-help actions, we are seeing significant relief on the cost side relative to capacity cuts. These combined efforts have resulted in a reduction of more than $2 billion in full year 2020 operating expenses. In terms of capital spending, we have virtually eliminated all expenditures this year with over $1 billion and canceled our deferred projects and reduced aircraft delivery payments. We've canceled or deferred hundreds of projects this year, but we are continuing to work on several critical work streams, such as our recent GDS launch that Tom covered. We have a new agreement with Boeing and are currently working with them on our revised aircraft delivery and payment schedules for 2020 and 2021. The agreement allows us to take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We have not nailed down the specifics, and we have some time to do so but for 2020, at this point, we currently expect to receive fewer than the 27 MAX aircraft that we were previously planning for this year.  Between our work with Boeing and our retirement plans for -700 fleet, I feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, both to flex down or up as needed. And of course, we are mindful that the environment is fluid and dynamic, and we want to position ourselves to be able to adjust quickly based on a recovery of travel demand or to a prolonged recovery with no growth. We have included our March 31 order book in our 10-Q that was filed this morning, and it isn't updated yet for this agreement. However, for 2020 and 2021 deliveries, excluding the 16 leased aircraft with third parties, we have reduced our contractual deliveries with Boeing by at least 59 aircraft or roughly half.  I am proud of what we have accomplished quickly, and it is showing up in significantly lower cash burn in second quarter. Our original outlook for second quarter pre-pandemic was average core cash burn in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. With actions to date, we now estimate our second quarter average core cash burn to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million per day. And to be very, very clear, the average core cash burn that I'm sharing includes cash outflows, capital expenditures and debt service, but excludes the impacts from cash sales, refunds and proceeds from financing transactions and the payroll support program. Of course, we've shared that we aren't seeing much in terms of bookings for second quarter. In terms of revenue -- excuse me, in terms of refunds, roughly 80% of our tickets sold are nonrefundable. Therefore, the majority of trip cancellations have resulted in issuances of travel credits. For March, when trip cancellations peaked to record levels, total cash refunds were approximately $250 million. Thus far in April, cash refunds are running roughly half that of March and total trip cancellations are somewhat elevated or much lower given the large cycle this month. So that brings me to a few thoughts I'd like to share with you on air traffic liability. As of March 31, air traffic liability was $6.2 billion, of which $3.6 billion or 60% was our loyalty program balance outstanding for Rapid Rewards. About 1/3 of our total air traffic liability balance represents travel credits that have already been issued around $2.1 billion. So that leaves a balance of $500 million to $600 million net, that is not related to Rapid Rewards or issued travel credits that we expect to fly in future months. And this represents less than 10% of our total air traffic liability, which is very manageable. On the cost front, I want to highlight one area that has really helped. Our employees are pitching in to really save the company money by participating in voluntary time-off and temporary leave programs. We had almost 490,000 hours reduced from these programs in March alone, saving us an estimated $15 million in salaries and wages. We have over 3,000 employees utilizing voluntary leave and partial pay programs in April. And for May, we currently have more than 7,000 employees electing to take voluntary leave.  As we adapt to a dramatically reduced flight schedule, we know we have to look at how best to manage our workforce and limit impact to our people. We have extended leave programs through the end of August, and we are also considering options for voluntary early retirement, along with long-term leave programs.  I'll share a few quick comments on fuel. Our first quarter fuel price was $1.90 per gallon, down $0.15 or 7.3% year-over-year. Brent crude oil averaged $51 per barrel in first quarter, but the real story is the dramatic fall-off in prices with Brent crude oil at $69 per barrel in early January and ending at a low of $23 per barrel by the end of March.  We continue to see significant relief from lower energy prices, lower market fuel prices saved as $80 million in the first quarter compared to market prices at the beginning of the year. For second quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1 to $1.10 per gallon range, which is down nearly $200 million since the beginning of the year. And significantly lower than last year's second quarter fuel price of $2.13 per gallon. When considering the reduction of fuel gallons this year due to capacity cuts, we currently estimate 2020 fuel expense to be down over $2 billion from beginning of year levels, which is much welcome relief on cost and cash in this low revenue environment. Our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices, which has continued to fall even in recent days, due to the lack of floor risk in our portfolio. And while we have not made any adjustments to our hedges for 2020, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. This will continue to be the case as long as capacity is drastically reduced, but the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged.  So for example, we are more than 100% hedged in second quarter, triggering a GAAP loss of $2 million in first quarter other gains and losses for mark-to-market adjustments that were recognized in other comprehensive income in prior periods. And our second quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year-over-year at $24 million spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with a $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. I simply want to point out that there isn't movement related to our hedging positions or premium costs in 2020. There is just noise in the metrics related to the significant reduction of fuel gallons due to capacity cuts.  Despite the ongoing grounding of the fuel-efficient MAX fleet, our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 0.8% year-over-year due to reduced capacity in March. As we test live, we operated fewer of our less fuel-efficient aircraft, which net to a slight improvement year-over-year. And we should see further improvement year-over-year in second quarter for the same reason. Finally, a few more quick thoughts from liquidity. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.5 billion and we currently have a cash balance of over $9 billion. We included in our press release this morning the detail of the sources of incremental cash this year, which totaled $6.8 billion through yesterday, so I won't list those again. But we aren't done. We remain laser-focused on reducing our cash burn and evaluating other sources of liquidity to further bolster our cash reserves, and we are in a great position to do so. Our goal is to add capital in a way that protects the balance sheet and our investment grade rating while addressing the liquidity issue so that we are prepared for any scenario well into 2021. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all 3 rating agencies. And even after our financing transactions thus far, we still have over $6 billion in unencumbered aircraft and roughly $2 billion in other unencumbered assets, such as real estate, spare engines and ground equipment, to name a few. In closing and to reiterate our comments today, we are focused on keeping our employees and customer safe, conserving cash, adjusting our flight schedules and fleet as necessary, and leveraging our strong balance sheet and financial position to further boost our liquidity. Despite our first quarter net loss, we still generated pretax return on invested capital of 18.1% or 14.3% after tax on a trailing 12-month basis. We have a proven track record with a seasoned leadership team that has successfully managed through uncertain times. We don't know how this crisis will continue to unfold, and we don't know what the recovery will look like from air travel to the broader economy. But we came into this crisis as the best prepared U.S. airline, and we plan to emerge as the best prepared U.S. airline, both financially and operationally. With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : I hope you're well. When you contemplate the debt maturities you're facing in the coming years and the issues you've had with the MAX, how do you think about the attractiveness of hundreds of lightly used NGs coming available on a global basis over the next few years? Tammy Romo : Hunter, how are you doing? I'm doing great. Yes, we have significant flexibility with our fleet plan, Hunter. And I'll just say that our preference is to get new airplanes from Boeing. Boeing has been a great partner with us, and they have certainly been working with us to restructure our order book as we manage through the situation here. So I think we'll have plenty of opportunities to get the new airplanes that we need from Boeing.  But in any event, we will have plenty of aircraft should we have opportunities and need to tap into more airplanes. And then I'll just also point out that we also have flexibility on the other side, which is to retire. So we do have opportunities to retire our older airplanes, less fuel-efficient airplanes. And just keep in mind that even though fuel prices are at low levels, fuel price -- fuel costs, as you know, is our second largest cost component. So having a 14% savings on fuel burn relative to the next-gen aircraft is still very meaningful and very significant.  So as always, we'll continue to do our fleet planning in a way that delivers good economics on an operating basis and also delivers low ownership costs for years and years to come. Hunter Keay : Okay, Tammy thanks. And then, Gary, you mentioned, you and Tom, together working on some high-level inputs on three -- well, you talked about three basic recovery scenarios. I was wondering if you could just frame those out for me at a high level, either through capacity or revenue in terms of sort of -- I know you're not going to make any predictions here, but what are the numbers around those three basic recovery scenarios that you'd be comfortable sharing with us as you think about contingency planning? Gary Kelly : Yes. Sure, Hunter. And I think they are really themes. One would be the current trends continue. So it's an L-shaped recovery. Another one would be just a gradual increase off of an L-shaped recovery. And then, thirdly, would be a U-shaped recovery beginning, let's say, maybe in the fourth quarter, Tom.  So that work is underway. And I think, Hunter, the way that I would want you all to think about this is we've got a commitment through September 30 with the PSP of the CARES Act to not involuntarily downsize the airline. So we just -- if things don't improve, we'll have to do something after that. So we just want to be very prepared with what our options are. Tom, I would say, by mid-summer.  So we've got a pretty good line of sight to May. My hope is that the May revenue trends continue to improve from where we are in April. It does feel like we bottomed out the first week of April. We've seen very gradual improvement in weeks 2 and 3. And so I would hope that, that would continue.  We've got pretty modest expectations. I think it's fair to say for June at this point. And hopefully, we're too pessimistic there. But by -- hopefully by July, August, we're beginning to see some improvement that would encourage us in terms of which plan to lock down on. But I think the basic report is we've got to be prepared here, continue to be prepared, and we've got to be prepared for just about any negative scenario. So hopefully, that gives you some insight. As I mentioned, the net cash burn without working capital changes in April is $900 million. We just -- we can't continue on at that pace. So we would attack that with additional cost reductions and certainly cuts to the schedule would be the immediate levers that we would push.  You asked about the fleet. Mike is working on the fleet plan. And bringing in used equipment is more work, and it's -- it carries some additional risk, but we're not in a position right now where we're thinking that we want to grow the fleet anyway. I think, Mike, you probably -- and Tammy said this, but -- so just thinking about the fleet, which, again, is an element of answering your second question, our bias right now is to have fewer airplanes, not more airplanes. If we get into the welcome scenario where we need more airplanes, I think we'll have all we want in a reasonable period of time.  So we -- Tammy made the point earlier today that we've got a program to retire a fair number of airplanes in 2020 and '21, that we were holding back on because of the delays with the MAX deliveries. So I think we're looking more aggressively at that. And just finally, we're already working on offering voluntary exit packages for our employees in addition to reduced work opportunities for employees in order to cut expenses. So right now, the bias is towards shrinking the airline some, not radically. Hopefully, we won't have to face that scenario. But if we do, we'll have a plan. Operator : And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Gary, I was hoping you could speak to what you have seen coming out of prior downturns. Obviously, the situation has unique attributes. But if we think back to post 9/11 or the period immediately following 9/11, it took the industry years to recover positive traffic growth, but it was only a couple of quarters for Southwest. Why would post 9/11 be a good comparison for what is going on now? And where do you think that comparison falls short? Gary Kelly : I think at least the recessions that I experienced, Southwest was in a similar position where we were low-cost, have a strong brand. We were -- we've never been, of course, in the past, as large as we are today. So we didn't have the same kind of a footprint. But there's a lot of similarities. We had a strong balance sheet. We had plenty of cash, and we were prepared for the unexpected. So I think all those are very similar. The points that I was -- I'd be a little repetitive at arguing earlier is that this is no doubt a recession and we've seen the same pattern in the previous 3 recessions that I experienced where business travel is cut very sharply, and businesses can be very disciplined and they can issue orders. Thou shalt not travel. And of course, we're seeing that now for different reasons, but perhaps in addition to economic reasons.  But the recovery, as you pointed out, of business travel, overall, was many years. And so Southwest benefited in those recovery scenarios because of our low-cost and our low fares, and we gained share. And it was very dramatic after the first Gulf War in the early 1990s. And obviously, everything changed dramatically after 9/11, and we became, very shortly, the largest airline in the country by 2003, 2004. So 2008 is more contemporary times for people, and you know what's happened there.  So I think that was my point, is that we are fully expecting that traffic will recover. But it will recover over a long period of time. And we're sort of in the depths of this problem right now. And it's hard to see through to the other side. But this too shall pass. And I do hear and read comments about, well, New York is never going to be the same again. Well, that's just crazy. And no one knows exactly what the world is going to be like in the future. But if we can have the roaring '20s following the Spanish flu of 1918, which is far worse than what we're experiencing today, there's every reason to have hope and confidence that we can get through this.  But realistically, we just can't expect that things are going to be back to normal in 6 or 12 months. I don't believe that for a minute. So you need staying power, you need low cost, you need great people. You need resolve. And that's kind of where we are. We also need a plan. And I'm proud of our folks and how they have reacted so quickly to something that is really hard to wrap your mind around, but our folks have, and if we need to radically restructure Southwest Airlines, we will do that. I think we have a great product, and I think we have a very successful business model, and I don't feel that, that will be necessary, but we're going to be prepared for every possible scenario here. And if it's a V-shape recovery, well, we'll all high-five each other and we'll go buy some more airplanes. But I don't think that's the most likely outcome right now. Does that answer the essence of your question? Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And just for a follow-up, in light of the actions that you're taking today, can you just give us some perspective on how you're thinking about the loans portion of the CARES' stimulus package? What are the positives and negatives of the loans? And should we be thinking about the actions you're taking today as an alternative to that? Or in addition to? Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. And I know Tammy will want to speak to this too. But basically, coming into this, and again, at a pretty high level, we felt like it was important for the government, the federal government, to flood our country with liquidity so we can get through this crisis without having a depression. So that's my view, and I think that view is shared by many. And the way we tapped into that is through the CARES Act payroll support program thus far.  So you're all very familiar with that. Our share was $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion. We've gotten half of that so far. We'll get the other half over the next 90 days, May, April -- I'm sorry, May, June, July. I'll go forward with the calendar.  So the other part that you are referring to is the big loan program. There's a little loan component of the payroll support program. But the other part of the CARES Act that's available to the industry is the secured loan program. And our share of that -- our pro rata share of that is $2.8 billion. The application is due this week. We will apply. We'll reserve access to that amount. Tammy can talk to you about the cost of that. I think right now, we're not committed to taking advantage of that. We have until September 30 to do so, and that will give us time to evaluate other financing options.  Obviously, with today's news, we're putting ourselves in a really strong liquidity position that I'm very pleased with. But I think Hunter mentioned it, we're going to need to think beyond just this year and think how we're going to pay down this debt, how we're going to restructure the balance sheet over time. So Tammy and her team will continue, I think -- well, I know, to be very active in working this. The thing about the loan program is it carries, from your perspectives, it carries a lot of conditions. We can't pay dividends during the time that the loan is outstanding plus a year, can't do any share repurchases. You may not be as concerned about executive compensation, but it's just another restriction on the company's ability to manage.  So I think the cost of the debt is pretty reasonable. I'll let Tammy speak to that. But the security, the collateral required, we've been led to believe will be pretty lenient, but we don't know. So I think all of those things have to be thought through very carefully. And it could be that we want to entertain taking out that loan and then paying it off pretty quickly as long as the conditions also come off quickly as well.  So right now, it's out there as an option for us, and we're not committed to take it. Anything you want to add, Tammy? Tammy Romo : No, Gary, I think you really covered it all. Just in terms of the structure of the loan, that would be a 5-year senior secured term loan. And as Gary said, the terms are reasonable, LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and it's attractive that the loan is prepayable at any time. So it really just gives us a lot of options here, and it's certainly a wonderful backstop to have, and we're very grateful for that. Operator : The next question will come from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Gary, I was just thinking, I've known you almost 30 years, and I think this is the first time I've heard you refer to the roaring '20s. I actually like that reference a lot, just not really part of the vernacular in the past. Gary Kelly : I wasn't there. I wasn't there. Jamie Baker : Oh, yes. Not suggesting that either of us were. First question for Tammy, could you give us the composition of the $2 billion in unencumbered non-aircraft assets? Tammy Romo : So the $2 billion of non-encumbered, they're just miscellaneous assets like gates, slots, simulators, really base... Gary Kelly : Engine. Tammy Romo : Yes. Just general asset such as that. Jamie Baker : Okay. But LaGuardia and D.C. slots are in that pool. You're counting that in that? Tammy Romo : Yes. Yes. It would include all of that sort of -- those sort of assets. Gary Kelly : But no lightbulbs. There's no lightbulbs in that number. Jamie Baker : Got it. Got it. But also no loyalty assumptions, correct? Tammy Romo : No, sir. Jamie Baker : Okay. And second question, probably for Gary. You indicated this morning not fully selling the cabin going forward. I'm curious if you could expand on what sort of limits you're envisioning? And also, how this will be reflected and how you guide on capacity? I assume when you discuss capacity and when you file schedules, it's still going to be based on the entire seat complement, where in reality, flowing capacity, maybe lower by whatever seat cap you put in place. I mean, I guess that could be a difference of as much as 1/3 if we're taking out middle seats? Gary Kelly : Yes, sir. So I definitely want to speak to that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've got a series of work efforts, and this is one. So -- and I'll just, at the outset, say, this too shall pass. So this is not forevermore. Things will get back to normal. It's just a question of when and what do we need to do to get from here to there?  So in the meantime, we all know that there is a health concern. So here in Texas, Governor Abbott announced yesterday that the state is opening back up for business and they do informal polls, and it shows 3 quarters of the people think it's too soon. So we know that we have work to do to convince customers that are willing and able to travel that it is safe to come to the airport. It's safe to get on to the airplane. And we all know the techniques. We're going to -- where you've got masks. So there's PPE. We'll be doing cleaning and disinfecting and Mike went through all the things that we're doing there, which I'm very proud of, but then you've got social distancing. There was a new story just this morning of a woman who was on a flight who it was unexpectedly full and she was uncomfortable with that. So for now, we are thinking, and Tom will be working on this. We are thinking that perhaps we won't take bookings that would fill up an airplane. So it would be something less than that. Where there is nothing physical that I want us to do to an airplane, we're certainly not going to take out seats and nor would we go to the effort to block a middle seat nor would we prevent anybody from sitting in the middle seed, but we would simply manage it from a bookings standpoint.  That is an idea. We haven't announced that yet. We haven't implemented that yet, but that would be a logical way to address a concern about social distancing getting on the airplane. So the flip of that, Jamie, would be, fine, you can try to sell-out the airplane. But if people aren't willing to risk that, well, then, you're going to fail.  So all this, again, argues for low cost, really managing our expenses carefully, making sure we have plenty of cash to manage our way through this time period. We'll be thinking about mask and things like that with customers. I know that one of our competitors had an announcement on that today. We'll certainly be doing everything that we have to do to follow CDC guidelines. But in terms of mandating that customers and employees have to be doing things, just stay tuned on that part of the question. Operator : The next question will be from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Just, I guess, two here. When I look at -- and maybe this is actually a question for Mike. When I look at your capacity cuts, it does seem like that you are cutting a bit less than what you would suspect with revenues down 90% to 95%. And I'm not sure how much of that is just a function of your network, will you do a lot more point-to-point? Or the fact that it does give you the flexibility to do a lot more close-in cancellations, which, in theory, should preserve more cash. Just thoughts on that? Gary Kelly : It's really the latter. And so I think as a rule of thumb, you all should assume that we will schedule more than we'll fly. Right now, it's guesswork as to what traffic demand will be. And obviously, we -- right now, we're -- it's not such a guess to know that it will be light. But Mike's team will -- it's sort of a two-pronged effort. Tom's team will publish a reduced schedule, which, believe it or not, takes quite a bit of technological effort to accomplish. And then Mike's team, on an operating basis, days ahead of a scheduled flight, will go in and cancel aggressively. So Tom and Mike, you all may want to comment on it. Thomas Nealon : I'll jump on that one. Mike, I actually like where we are at this point with our reductions for April, May and June. If we need to take more capacity out, we can. It's just -- honestly, it's a lot easier to take capacity out than it is to put capacity back in. And I'd like to maintain as many itineraries as we possibly can. And I'll just respond accordingly. But I think at this point, if you look at where we are, take me, for example, our ASMs are down about 65%, but we're only reducing our O&D markets by 28%. So we're maintaining itineraries. Now that's quite different than the mix of our competition. So I feel really good that we are serving the markets. We have product out of the shelf, if you will. And if the product isn't selling, we'll take it out. That's what the operation is like, we'll take it and then you'll see we'll pull the capacity out. It's just very hard to put it back in. So I'd rather have it on hand and pull it out as necessary. Gary Kelly : So Mike, that's why we said that we'll be reducing our capacity at least 60%. And it could -- Mike, from the schedule, you can reduce it another 10 points, can't you? Michael Linenberg : Yes. So we've got about 1,400 flight-ish scheduled for May. And that's close -- we're operating slightly fewer than that today. So I think that we can cut that down a little bit if we need to. Gary Kelly : I think it's positioned really well. And if the traffic isn't there, we're going to -- we'll be aggressive in cutting expenses. And the other thing that we're trying to do here is reach a goal or a milestone of producing a cash profit, just looking at the flight operating costs. So bringing in a little -- while it might appear on the surface that there's too much capacity, that's still cash positive, if you will, even though it may not be enough cash to cover overhead. That's still saying that it's better to fly that flight and use that airplane as opposed to letting it just sit there on the ground. Michael Linenberg : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just, Gary, back to your -- in your opening comments, you talked about the importance of low fares. And then I think within a sentence or two, you also talked about this modification of the customer experience. And it does feel like that there will be some permanent change to how people book and fly going forward. Are those in congrues to have arguably higher costs tied to this new experience versus low fares? How do -- how are you thinking about that now? And I realize it's early. Gary Kelly : Yes, Mike, it is early. And again, I'm not willing to accept yet that the flight experience is forevermore changed. So I don't agree with that. For this year and until this pandemic is behind us, oh, yes, I think we're going to be living and operating differently. Going to a restaurant is going to be different. So -- but at some point, this will get behind us, and we will get back to normal. So in the meantime, I think that's part of the restructuring effort that Tom is working on. We need to be mindful of those things, see what kind of impact these things might have to our cost structure or our revenue opportunity. I think what -- the point I was trying to impress on is it doesn't matter, everything is relative. So it's -- this is going to apply evenly across the industry in terms of the change from here, and it just makes the low-cost position even more important than ever. It's -- because there's going to be cost pressure in addition to revenue pressure. And I think it's back to Duane's question. History shows that through recessions, it's the low cost that wins, and that's served us well and, certainly, where our focus will be more than ever here going forward. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. And we'll take our last question from Joe Caiado with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Gary, I'll ask a high-level question. The immediate focus has obviously been on doing everything you can to position Southwest to survive and to navigate the current crisis and come out the other side of this. Are you worried at all about the supply chain that sits underneath you and especially perhaps smaller vendors and suppliers and their ability to navigate the crisis and then ultimately support an industry recovery. Can you just comment on what you see in the supply chain and any concerns that you have there? Gary Kelly : Well, Joe, that's a great question. I think in this -- I mean, this is a catastrophe. So it -- there's plenty to worry about. And yes, I worry about that. I worry about our suppliers. There was an article in Aviation Daily, I guess it was this morning, about Airbus and reporting that they may not survive. So this -- yes. Now in terms of what we've seen so far, I don't think we've seen -- of course, it's only, in fairness, 7 weeks into this, and we got a long way to go. But if Tammy leads up our supply chain, I don't know of any -- we're not running into any problems that are getting in the way of us executing. I'll put it that way, that I'm aware of. Tammy Romo : I agree, Gary. I think our supply chain, our team is doing a fantastic job in what has been a really challenging situation just in terms of PPE, they've worked really hard to secure that, but they've been able to secure what we need. And at least so far, no major disruptions. Joe Caiado : I appreciate those thoughts. Stay safe. Tammy Romo : You too. Gary Kelly : Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you all for joining, and have a nice afternoon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the media portion of today's call. I'd like to introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. Hello, everyone, and welcome. And I think we'll go ahead and jump right into the Q&A portion, Chad, if you want to give them some instructions on how to queue up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg. Mary Schlangenstein : I just wanted to ask real quickly. Would some flight go to the point of requiring passengers or crew to wear facemasks during flight, or at the airport, I guess? Michael Van de Ven : Mary, this is Mike. We have been trying to follow CDC guidance as best we can. We have highly recommended that our employees and our customers wear mask while they were at work or traveling. And to date, we have seen the vast majority of our employees and our customers just naturally follow those instructions. But we are in the process of rolling out a temporary policy that, at least with respect to our employees that are on the frontline-facing customers that in the near term, they'll need to wear masks while better work in their front-line positions. And then we're also going to be in a position to have available for customers a mask if they would like to wear one and do not -- and they don't have one with them. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. But at this point, no requirement for passengers? Gary Kelly : No requirement. Yes, Mary. But I do think that it's a valid question and one that it's fair to say that we're continuing to think through ourselves. I just don't think we've gotten back to the point where the vast -- the majority of people have been confronted with this. So everybody has been sheltering at home and here in Texas, as we were talking earlier, now people can venture out starting on Friday. And I think that we're going to find that there's a strong majority of people who aren't comfortable unless everyone around them has a mask on as an example. So I think it's a little bit premature for us to make that judgment. I think we're all inclined to let people make their -- use their own good common sense, but in this particular case, we may be -- we may need to be more aggressive there, but we haven't made that decision yet. Operator : The next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : I wanted to ask about your agreement with Boeing to reduce MAX deliveries through 2021 and your order book review. Is it fair to assume that as deliveries get pushed down the line that some will ultimately be canceled? Michael Van de Ven : So yes, this is Mike again. So we have -- so the MAX is a really good airplane. We've got a great price on the airplane. It's fuel-efficient, has got great engine performance. The engine costs are really good. And just in the long-term at Southwest Airlines, it will be in our best position to bring that airplane into the fleet. So we have a lot of flexibility with the Boeing order book. And right now, we have so many airplanes sitting on the ground, it doesn't make a lot of sense to bring additional airplanes in from Boeing. So we do have a lot of flexibility to shift orders down. But as Gary said, I do think that this is going -- the industry is going to rebound, and we're ultimately going to have -- need airplanes to fly in the fleet. And so we do want to bring the MAX on to the fleet. And if we need to early retire or manage the fleet by taking older airplanes out of the fleet, I think that's the best position for us to be in. Gary Kelly : But Tammy, we haven't -- there's no cancellation of the position. They're just moving. Tammy Romo : No. Yes, I think your takeaway should be that we're still working through restructuring our order book with Boeing. And just what we announced so far is just -- is a piece of that. But it's just too early to know. And obviously, Boeing is going to be very thoughtful with the MAX return to service, so we -- and we'll work with them on that and a delivery schedule that makes sense for Southwest, but no cancellations so far. Tracy Rucinski : That's really helpful. And just one more, if you could help us understand how the new situation affects your negotiations with Boeing regarding MAX compensation? Gary Kelly : Well, I think that's all part of it. In fairness, we don't need the MAX right now. We don't need all the airplanes that we have. So it's hard for me to argue to them that we're being damaged by MAX delays here in April, to be brutally honest. So all of that, again, is -- we have a great relationship with Boeing. I think, arguably, we're their best customer around the world. And we've worked together through this MAX crisis so far, and I have every reason to believe that we'll continue to work very well together. But there's nothing there's -- we don't have an issue with the MAX as we sit here today. We're anxious to get it back in the air, and they're working hard with the FAA to get it ungrounded and recertified. So we'll be looking forward to that. Operator : And our next question will come from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : I had just a question about your conversations, if you've had any, with the Federal government, the FAA, CDC, with Trump himself about safety at airports? Are you guys talking about either testing passengers or taking temperatures or anything like that? I know Trump is speaking about that earlier today. And also, Tammy, can you just go over the numbers for the MAX deferrals? Gary Kelly : Well, the answer to your first question is yes. We are talking with the administration, members of Congress about what the protocols should be. And I think it's fair to say that the airlines for America Trade Association is leading the effort to advocate for some kind of health screening at the security checkpoint. And I know our Chief Operating Officer has, Mike Van de Ven, has argued that it is -- it's just another element of security, if you will. Just making sure that you don't have sick people on an airplane that could infect others. So absolutely, those ideas are out there. I don't have anything to report this morning other than what we agree with your thought that some kind of screening makes sense. And I think to get people flying again, they need to be comfortable. And I think that, that's one way to provide additional comfort. Leslie Josephs : But that would be in the hands of the federal government or some federal agencies doing those checks that... Gary Kelly : Well, that would be my opinion, and that's what we've advocated with our trade association, and that's what I believe they'll take forward to the administration and the members of Congress. But again, your question is being actively discussed. I don't -- I think what I'm reporting is I don't think any decisions have been made. What -- the scenario that you're asking where perhaps the federal government does not take up a role, then what would we do? I think that, that's a question we'd have to answer. I think a lot of it, again, just depends on how long this goes on. We're not prepared to be medical professionals. But we're asking all the same questions that you are. And obviously, again, speaking for Southwest, advocating that the federal government assume that role. The screening is there. So it seems very natural to be done at that point. Leslie Josephs : And is it possible for the MAX deferrals to -- is it possible, Tammy? Tammy Romo : Sure, I'd be happy to take you through that. So if you go back to last quarter, where we were sitting at that point in time is if you look at the MAX aircraft that were coming directly from Boeing, there were 107 deliveries. And then we had another 16 that we are scheduled to take delivery from third parties. So the agreement that we now have with Boeing is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft between now and the end of next year. So that's how we get the reduction of at least 59. So again, we're still working with them on the specifics and exactly how many airplanes we would want to take between now and the end of the year. So keep in mind, with respect to the MAX, if you'll recall, we -- Boeing has 27 of our MAX aircraft that have been billed and produced. And so at this point, we're not planning to -- we're planning to take less than those 27. Again, we haven't worked through those details with Boeing, so those discussions are ongoing. And as we lock that down, we'll certainly share that with you. Michael Van de Ven : Leslie, this is Mike. Also, just -- I know that you know this, but just remember, the Boeing is not producing those airplanes today either. And so they don't have a production schedule between now and the end of next year, that they can even tell you exactly how many airplanes would be available. So that's part of the discussion with them about the order book. What is their production capacity, what do we need and how does that start to play together. Operator : The next question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Just wondering if you could talk about sort of the state of, I guess, labor relations and negotiations with the various workgroups right now. It seem like there was a lot of solidarity going into the discussions with the government and wondering if that's holding up or if there's any sense that there's sort of -- that's kind of fraying a bit? Gary Kelly : Well, there's not -- just because of the severity of the crisis, there's just not a lot of -- there's not a lot of negotiations, if you will. I think what we've got to do now is what I was referring to earlier, which is come up with scenario plans and then depending on how severe they are, I think that's when we would need to engage with our labor unions. We've kept them informed about what happened to the business. We've kept them informed about the actions that we've been taking. We've all had a common concern about the health and well-being of our employees. And so I feel like that we are well aligned on that. But there -- in an environment where we would need to seek concessions, all of that -- none of those conversations have taken place.  And I don't -- I think everyone can understand that nobody wants to make concessions. I think my overarching message to our people, not labor relations, just our people, is that we're going to have to work together to get through this. And it just -- and everyone in the country, with very few exceptions, is having to make sacrifices, and in some cases, very painful sacrifices. That's nobody's fault. But that is the reality. And so I think we, at Southwest, are a family. And just want to make sure that everybody is minimally prepared for the reality of the challenge. And the fact that we may all have to bang together here and make some painful sacrifices. But that -- those conversations have not taken place other than just to try to set the expectation, just like I've shared it with you. My hope is that we get through this without a lot of pain, but we've got to be prepared for the worst. And it's pretty bad here in April.  So it's not theoretical. I mean, it's right here right now, and we've got to get passengers on the airplane in numbers that are sufficient to pay the bills or else we're going to have to take, obviously, a lot more drastic action. But when relations are no different than they were. They're very solid. And I got to believe that our people when -- if the time comes, and we need to do some things, I think we'll have a lot of very willing participants. Alison Sider : Is there any like normal ongoing work with contract negotiations like with pilots? Or is that all kind of on hold until there's a little more clarity? Gary Kelly : Yes, all of that's confidential. But I do think just -- yes, the headline is everything is in suspense when it comes to that because all of those are talking about the future. And the future is just so uncertain. It's really hard to -- it's back to Tammy and Mike's points about Boeing. It's really hard to make plans for the future with Boeing when you don't know what the future is. So I think -- and the other thing, Alison, is that everybody realizes that this is an emergency. So there -- the health analogy is apt. The Southwest is in intensive care. So there are things that must be attended to today. And there's -- just in terms of prioritizing the work efforts, there's things that can be attended to later. And clearly, that's one of the laters. What our people want is job security and pay security and benefits. And they've got that at least for now. And so we're not -- I think that's what they are most interested in, and we'll worry about what changes we can make at a later date. But right now, it's -- we're just trying to make sure that we have a plan to survive this, and then we will be working hard to make sure that we have a plan to thrive once we get through this. Operator : The next question is from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Conor Cunningham : Gary, you've covered some of this in response to Jamie Baker's question and also Mary's and here and there elsewhere. But could you kick off again the things you're likely to do to make customers more comfortable about flying again? And one example of that would be -- you discussed this, but how much less than full would you book flights? And how long do you think you will have to do that? Gary Kelly : You bet, Dave. Well, I think it's just all of the basic things that the country is going through in terms of -- we need to defeat the virus, right? So we need a vaccine. We need therapies to treat people who do get the virus. We need testing to know who's sick and who deserves. And so there are things like that to be considered. And Tom Nealon is leading up the customer effort on that. And I think you should expect some announcements from us soon on that front. Then you have -- what's left is within our environment, it's pretty much a social distancing. So we can do things within the airport to address that. We can do things to modify our boarding process to accommodate social distancing. And you're finally left in with the airplane. And if you left every middle seat open, that would be booking the airplane to 2/3. So you have a 66.66% load factor. And I view that idea as a temporary thing.  Again, I don't accept that forever more, people are going to stay 6 feet apart from each other, and we're masked for the rest of our lives. I just don't believe that. I think we'll get past this pandemic. And with a little luck, we won't have one for another century. But until we get to that point, we've got to be prepared for masks, certainly, and social distancing, certainly. And I think we've got an effective way to think about that. The other thing that I haven't -- I should have mentioned earlier, Tammy, to -- in our call and shame on me for not doing it. But we are a really high-quality, low-cost airline. And we have never gotten our cost low by jamming extra seats on airplanes. So it's a very comfortable seating environment. And I think that's going to work again in our favor here. And on the -- just circling back to the middle seat idea, Dave, finally, if I'm traveling with my 2 granddaughters, and I want one of them to sit by me in the middle seat, I want to have that option to do that. So we're not going to physically restrict this or ask our flight attendants to be policing men and women on this. We'll just -- we'll manage that. If we do this, we'll manage it in some other means by simply just taking less than 100% bookings. David Koenig : Sure. I don't want to get into a discussion to pitch in all that, but you could say that, well, people sitting in the same aisle seat, but one row back from each other. They're closer than 6 feet. So that's why I wondered if you meant take -- holding capacity at something less than 67%, but it sounds like that's kind of where you're thinking. Gary Kelly : That's my thought. Where we end up, we haven't made a final determination on that. But with 2/3 of the airplane, it, David, kind of gets back to the same point, which is we just can't burn $900 million a month forever. And so we've got to have some balance between social distancing and just the affordability for people to fly, right? Even here in April, we have tens of thousands of people flying every single week, every single day. And so I mean, that's what the government has asked us to do is keep the transportation lines open. So we're going to have to find some balance there, but we recognize that we'll need some distancing in terms of the airplane experience. Michael Van de Ven : And David, this is Mike. And the distancing is just that -- I just want you to be aware, that's just one additional form of mitigation, but there are a lot of other things that are going on in the airplane. We've got a deep clean program of the airplane with those electrostatic misters and antimicrobial. So there will be no disease floating around on that airplane. We have -- we'll have -- everybody will have access to good personal hygienes with wipes or hand sanitizers and masks on board. And then I just don't want you to forget that everybody is sitting and facing in the same direction. We have very sophisticated building systems on the airplane. So it's not like those viruses just spread around the airplane. So I think the airplane environment is set up really well to be a pretty disinfected environment for our customers. And if we can go find a way to just enhance that a little bit with some social distancing, that's just additional goodness to it. And I think you'll see the same thing as you go through the airport with respect to the cleanliness of the facilities and then the availability for our employees and our customers to have exceptional personal hygiene in place as they go through that environment. Operator : Our next question will come from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Gary, you mentioned at the top of the call, you saw -- you think things bottomed out first week of April. You saw gradual improvement in the second and third week. Can you give us any color on where you're seeing even the slightest uptick? Are they tuned from these states that are lifting restrictions or maybe never had really tight restrictions? And related to that, it may not feel like it, but a month from now, summer vacation season is set to begin. Does Southwest see any scenario where there's a summer vacation season of any significance? Gary Kelly : Yes, Dawn, to your first question, yes, that's all proprietary information. So one of the things that Tom and his team are doing is just looking to the future and seeing what route changes we can make that will really help strengthen our strong points. And if there's some temporary exits that we want to make, we'll do that. But otherwise, we'll keep that information very close to the vest. Your summer travel season question is a good one. We have decent bookings in place for July as an example. We just have no idea. We have no way to predict where cancellations will be. And obviously, they've been very vigorous for the last 7 weeks. So that's a question that we have. So it's -- we'll be watching the demand for sort of June, July, August carefully. If, in fact, the company -- the country opens up like we are reading about, hearing about, there obviously half a dozen or more states that have relaxed their stay-at-home orders. Businesses are opening back up. I think that, that will put vacationers in a position where they can be more confident that, hey, I can go somewhere fun and there will be something to do when I get there.  So I'll just use my family as an example, they are determined, even though they've all sheltered in place, and they've been very cautious. They are determined that we're going to the beach in July for vacation. And I got to believe that we're one of many. So it just remains to be seen whether or not that will materialize. But there's no evidence right now other than extrapolating the current, there's no evidence that would say that people won't be traveling for vacation. But you have to believe that things are going to open up and that the kind of steps that Mike and Tom and Tammy and I have been describing as far as cleaning and mask and social distancing, all that will be acceptable to people. Tom, any thoughts? Thomas Nealon : I guess, just 1 or 2 thoughts. In terms of any specific cities or markets where we've seen a decline, obviously, the workers have a tough time, that's -- there's hotspots like that. But I think more than that, I think that what we're seeing is the bookings are -- it's really more of a barbell kind of booking curve as opposed to 0 to 6, 7 to 13. It just kind of spreading out 0 to 6, so people that really need to travel tend to be traveling. And then 40 days and beyond, which kind of gets your summer question, that's where the other piece of the booking tends to be coming from. And Gary's point is right. Up until COVID hits, we had a pretty nice booking curve for June, July. The question is going to be what you said, which is what does the cancellation curve look like. So we have to wait and see, and that will begin to be self-evident here in not-too-distant future. But the demand right now in April, May and June, for those booking time frames is just pretty anemic, right? That's just where we are. Operator : And our last question today will come from David Slotnick with Business Insider. David Slotnick : Gary, you said earlier in the call, I think, in the very beginning that in the past recessions, you've seen corporate travel take about 5 years to return. Everything that I'm reading is agreeing that corporate travel is probably going to obviously see a slow recovery than leisure. Do you think in this case that it might be a bit of a longer return for corporate travel, or the way beginning of that return just because of company's fear in liability of having their employees travel during COVID, maybe events meetings being canceled because work-from-home has been proven to be at least relatively feasible during this? Gary Kelly : Yes. The only thing I was going to say is it's -- when we think corporate, we think the really big companies, and Tom mentioned our corporate effort earlier. So we're really referring to business travel, overall, which is rule of thumb is about 1/3 of the traffic for us and 1/3 of the traffic for the industry. I think you can argue it many, many ways. I think a lot of business travel and corporate travel for that matter is -- would be in large meetings or conventions. And I would suppose that those are going to be slow to come back on for 2021 because a lot of those things have a long lead time, and you would think that people -- I mean, I can think of our own company, with large events that we host, it's just really hard to know exactly what the world is going to be like. And therefore, that kind of slows down making plans and making commitments.  But that's sort of, again, an 18-month time horizon. I read predictions by people that in 18 months, things are going to \"be back to normal.\"And I wouldn't disclose that -- I wouldn't discount rather that possibility. I think what we're trying to do is just put ourselves in a position where we can react effectively either direction. If we need to upsize, that will be a pleasant thing, and we'll do that. If we need to downsize, it will be less pleasant, but we'll be able to do that. And I think the main thing I was trying to share with you all earlier is that based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be. This one feels like -- which I think is your point, this one feels like it could be worse. And you've got companies that are ordering their employees not to travel. Again, there's historical precedents, I think, that are examples for these kinds of scenarios. And I just don't think -- we're just not in the business of making predictions, I guess. But I don't think there's any way to know. And I know a lot of people are using Zoom and there's predictions that, that will forevermore change meetings, and I just don't believe that. I think it's just one more tool that people have. And if you're like me, I'm sick of these Zoom calls. I'm ready to go talk to people face-to-face. So I don't -- we don't know, but we're certainly prepared for a very long recovery. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. Thank you all for being with us today. As always, if you have any follow-up questions, the communications team is ready to help you out.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, managing director of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. Joining me on the call, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President of Corporate Services; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO.  So following our prepared remarks today, we will open it up for Q&A and just a few quick disclaimers before we get started. We will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ from these expectations for a variety of reasons. We also had special items in our second-quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks. And of course, we have in-depth information and reconciliations in our earnings release from this morning on both forward-looking statements and GAAP and non-GAAP results, so please be sure to check those out. And now, we'll go ahead and get started, and I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you Ryan, and good morning everybody, and thanks for joining us on our second-quarter earnings call. This is a record quarterly loss for us. And of course, that can never be something that we're pleased about. But since our last earnings call in April, we have accomplished a great deal and performed better than the goals that we laid out at the time. Most importantly, we've boosted our liquidity. We've cut operating costs. We've generated traffic momentum. We've cut our daily cash burn rate to $16 million a day in June. And importantly, our success in generating traffic was key and key to the next several quarters. We have a viable flight schedule for our customers to choose from. We're operating an extremely reliable airline. Our people are delivering exceptional hospitality. We committed to the Southwest Promise on May 1 to assure our employees and our customers that their safety comes first. And we're offering low fares with no hidden fees, and all that adds up to record high levels of customer satisfaction. And of course, that is crucial. We offered voluntary separation and extended leave program that closed on July 15, as we had planned. Almost 17,000 employees signed up. And we're working on reorganizing the company and adjusting our fourth-quarter flight schedule to roughly match our people capacity which year over year will be down roughly 25%. And the majority of the volunteers selected the extended leaves, and there'll be recalls if we need to add capacity quickly. And that gives us tremendous flexibility and significant cost savings over the next several years. Implementing this program is a major objective in the third quarter. And while we have a plan for pay cuts, benefit cuts, furloughs and layoffs, we do not intend to pursue any of those at least through the end of this year. COVID-19 cases surged unexpectedly this month, and the U.S. is an outlier, and of course, that is disappointing. And we've seen a dramatic impact to our trends as far as traffic revenue and bookings this month, and we've had to reduce what was a very credible revenue forecast for the third quarter by hundreds of millions of dollars. And we would have easily beat our second-quarter daily cash burn number but for that. We'll have to work harder now and adjust August and September capacity in order to meet our goal of continued reduction in daily cash burn. We were on a path to breakeven by the end of the year. That is still my goal, but first quarter may be more realistic. This year and probably the first half of next year will be a game of tactics and iterations. We're going to execute, we'll monitor and we'll constantly adjust. And that means the schedule, and our fares, and our spending. Overall, I'm very pleased. I'm very encouraged. We knew this would be a long sawtooth slog with a lot of unexpected twist and turns, and it's proving to be so. Our country and the world needs to beat this virus. Until then, we're going to have to be resilient. We're going to have to persevere, and we're going to have to manage. And I think everybody needs to understand that we know enough now to know that we have a long, long way to go. And we will manage to sustain the health of our company, accordingly. We were very well prepared for this. We're prepared for a prolonged war against this pandemic. Our people have literally done all they have been asked and I could not be more proud. And I have never seen anything like this in my life. But after these many months of battle, I am more confident than ever that we will not just survive, but we will thrive. So we have a lot to cover this morning before we get to your questions. So with that very quick overview, let me quickly turn the call over to Bob Jordan, our executive vice president, who, among other things, is going to talk about our voluntary separation program and extended time off. Bob? Bob Jordan : All right. Well, thank you, Gary, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you, especially on this topic. As you know, we've been in the process of offering voluntary separation and extended leave options to our employees. They are voluntary, and they're hugely important as we work to reduce our staffing our operating cost and our cash burn, and these are the most generous programs we have ever offered as a company. The response from our employees was terrific, and I just want to say a huge thank you. These are really hard decisions, and our employees took them very seriously. Each person electing to separate or take an extended leave reduces our cash burn, and that helps preserve other jobs. I just want to say thank you to everybody that considered the options and especially to those that chose to opt in and participate. First on the raw numbers, and these are still being finalized, but I don't expect that they will change materially. Approximately 16,900 employees requested either voluntary separation or an extended leave of absence, and of those, about 4,400 requested voluntary separation. And the remaining 12,500 requested an extended leave of 6, 12 or 18 months and longer. The 4,400 voluntary separations represent 7% or so of the workforce -- of the active workforce, and the nearly 17,000 total between the two programs represent about 27% of the active workforce. And of the 12,500 request for an extended leave, over 60% are for a year longer. So the way I think about that, the combination of voluntary separation and leaves of a year or longer represent 20% of the active workforce was just a huge amount of flexibility. While the response from every group was really good, I do want to call out our pilots. Because of the relative financial value, it was key to have them participate, and our pilots really came through, with over 2,300 electing one of the two programs, and that represents about 25% of all active pilots. And I'm just really proud of them, and I'm really proud of all of our employees. We will be granting all requests for separation, and the vast majority of those will be separated before September 30. Extended leave requests aren't perfectly balanced across the company as you would expect and the operation, so there's a little bit of work to do there. But our goal is to allow every employee that wants to take an extended leave to take it. And those extended leaves are effective on September 1. Should the business recover faster than expected, the program allows for employees to be recalled within a reasonable notice time. Now with a quick update on the expected financial benefits. As outlined in our earnings release this morning, we estimated around $1.7 billion of accruals in the third -- in the second and third quarter related to the two programs. In terms of cash payments, nearly half will be paid out this year for voluntary separation and the remainder over several years as it relates to benefit costs and extended leave. However, we will see a material cost savings in salaries, wages and benefits in the fourth quarter of over $400 million. Our cost savings are expected to grow substantially in 2021. The recall flexibility that I discussed with extended time off could create some variability in the financial impact. Should we see a significant rebound in our business, but we currently estimate 2021 cost savings to be more than $1 billion. Because the leaves offer varying length, the financial benefits will decrease over an extended period of time. Again, the vast majority of employees requested a leave of a year or longer, and these programs are really about solving our staffing as our capacity moves over the next 12 to 18 months. So while our capacity plans may fluctuate, I'm just super happy with the numbers and how they help better align our cost to a lower level of flying. And I'm just totally grateful to the people of Southwest Airlines for their response. Every single work group responded better than we had forecasted. So that's just really gratifying. It provides critical flexibility right when we need it. And I'm hopeful we won't need additional actions, but if demand continues to stall, we will begin to assess actions to further reduce staffing, operating costs and cash burn. And with that very brief update, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Van de Ven : Thanks Bob. In addition to all that work that Bob just covered, we made significant adjustments to our operation in this bleak COVID-19 world. We started the quarter navigating through cancellations and customer re-accommodations based on a weak demand. The lack of demand led us to implement aircraft parking and storage programs. The trip cancellations created crewing and hotel challenges. And in the midst of that, we also introduced the Southwest Promise which drove significant changes in our operational procedures. Throughout all those efforts, our people produced the best quarterly operation that I can remember. They were heroic. They were magnificent. Their teamwork was superb. So as I mentioned, the month of April, we were reducing flights and re-accommodating the few customers that flew on the other flight. We had nearly 4,000 flights a day scheduled in April, and we operate about half of those. All of those cancellations kind of begins with our on-time performance. And overall we were 98% on time on flights we did operate, our on-time performance for April was 47%. That pulled down our overall quarterly results to 71.5%. We were more than happy to make that trade-off given the cash savings of not operating those near empty flights. But from May 3 June 30, we were able to adjust our flight schedules for demand, and we operated those schedules as published. Our OTP for that period was 94.8%, and that's the best May and June performance in 25 years. Our bag handling continue to improve with the rollout of our bag scanning program last year, and we added cargo scanning here in the second quarter. We had the lowest level of mishandled bags in our history in second quarter. Our customer Net Promoter Score was also the highest that we have on record. So our network design and our decision support tools that we're using in our operations create a solid foundation for whatever the future holds. We have the ability to add or cut flights close in as desired, and that operational flexibility is just critical in this environment. So turning to the fleet. We had roughly 400 aircraft in long-term storage or temporary parking programs in April, and that included our 34 MAX aircraft. Since April, our daily scheduled trips increased throughout the quarter and into July. And then additionally, our loads were increasing on each flight. And so we added roughly 6,900 extra sections beyond those scheduled as a result. Those items required more aircraft availability. So we added 300 aircraft back into the active fleet. And at this point, we have about 100 aircraft including the MAX, and long-term storage or temporary parking programs. We remain committed to the MAX. We look forward to its return to service. It is our most cost-effective airplane, and having it back into service will give us more certainty in terms of fleet planning. Given the most recent Boeing and FAA comments, we're hopeful to begin revenue service in late December. But given the history of delays, it certainly could slide into the first quarter. It will take at least a couple of months from the date the FAA formally ungrounds the aircraft for it to fly in revenue service. And that time will be needed for manual updates coordination with our certificate management office, required maintenance on the aircraft, pilot training and then validation on readiness flights that we want to perform. So wrapping up one of the most active, action-packed quarters that we've ever had, we navigated through the activities exceptionally well, producing superb operating results and customer accolades for our service. And as I said during the last quarter call, we are at war with COVID-19, and we are blessed to have a ferocious group of warriors that are ready for the fight. And they inspire me and our customers every day. So Tom, with that, over to you. Tom Nealon : All right. Thank you, Mike. Let me jump right to it. So our second-quarter operating revenues were down right around 83% year over year, and that was on capacity that was down right at 55%. Now we did see stronger demand and sequential improvement each month throughout the quarter, and we've given you updates throughout the quarter regarding April and May. We've recapped those in months in the earnings release. So I'm just going to provide a few quick comments on June and then get right into the third quarter. So leading into June, May trends were an improvement over April with consistent net positive bookings and a steady improvement throughout the month. And that continues in June, and we saw another steady improvement in trends which was very encouraging. With June operating revenues down 73% year over year and a load factor of 50%, and that was on capacity that was down 44%. Our business travel has been much more severely impacted than leisure travel, as you'd expect, and the result was that second-quarter revenue in passengers for business travel fell roughly 90% to 95%. We've had a lot of discussions with corporate travel managers, and we have been hearing some pretty cautious optimism about travel resuming back in the third and fourth quarters, but certainly, with the recent spike in COVID cases, that is far from what's going to happen. It's going to be much lower than we thought. Back in May, Gary has alluded to this, Mike's alluded to this, we introduced the Southwest Promise. And the purpose of the promise was to do everything that we could to make sure that we're taking care of our employees and taking care of our customers and giving them the confidence and the comfort to travel with us again. And as you expect, we're doing customer research every week. And the things that are the most important to them, and there are a lot of things we're doing with the Southwest Promise. But the things that really stand out, first, is the wearing of masks by both employees and customers. The second, this is a big deal, is limiting the seats available for sale and promoting social distancing in the gate area as well as during the boarding process and during the flight. And finally, the works that our tech ops and ground ops teams are doing around enhanced cleaning of the aircraft is right at the top of the list as well. So those are the three big things. The awareness among travelers of the Southwest Promise is very high. And the feedback that we're getting from our customers after they travel with us is that their confidence in Southwest and the likelihood they fly with us again in this environment is extraordinarily high. And they attribute that specifically to what we're saying and what we're doing with the Southwest Promise. We previously announced that we'll continue to block the middle seats through at least September which caps our lids or percentage of seats sold at 65%, and we made the decision to extend this through October. As you may recall, as loads picked up back in late May and into June, we actually began to add in extra flights, as Mike alluded to, to catch the demand that we're spilling with the load factor restrictions. And for the quarter, we added roughly 6,900 flights. And the vast majority, roughly 80%, covered their flying costs which far outweighed those that didn't. The point being is, as Mike alluded to again we have the ability. We have the tools and the capability to adjust our schedule up or down as demand changes, while doing a very good job managing our overall cash burn. This week, we've also announced a change to our mask or face-covering policy. It doesn't begin next week. So beginning on July 27, we will be requiring all customers to wear face covering throughout the flight, except for the brief period where someone is taking a drink or eating a snack. The only exception of this will be for children under the age of 2, and medical exemptions will no longer be accepted as a reason not to wear mask. The reason we're doing this is we're simply seeing too many exceptions to the policy and this put our flight crews in a really tough spot and also made our customers pretty uncomfortable. So this is something that goes in effect next week. So we are continuing to get very positive feedback from both our employees and our customers in the Southwest Promise. We are very committed to it. It's a big piece of what we're doing right now. And you can see in our data travel customer and Net Promoter Scores which is, as Gary alluded to, it's a -- it's an all-time quarterly record of 79 which is pretty darn amazing, given the environment that we're in. So our customers are certainly appreciating what we're doing with the Southwest Promise. All right. Turning to Q3. With our mid-June investor update, we estimated another modest improvement for July. And at that point, we're expecting operating revenues to be down roughly 65% to 70% with capacity down 30% and a load factor in the 45% to 55% range. Obviously, as COVID cases began to spike again in late June across the country, that -- areas of the country that have been performing with relative strength, such as Texas and Florida, began to slow very dramatically. And now we're estimating July operating revenues to be down roughly 70% to 75% year over year, with a load factor in the 40% to 45% range. Over the past several weeks, we've seen our net bookings decline 10 to 15 points year over year versus what we're seeing coming to the month which is a pretty significant change, very quickly, very abrupt. The trends are similar in August. Demand is much softer than we anticipated, and we're estimating August operating revenues to be down 70% to 80% year over year with the load factor of 30% to 40% range, and that's on capacity that's currently down 20% year over year. So we clearly have more work to do to bring our August capacity down further. But we have to keep in mind, we actually have a fair number of bookings for August already. So we need be careful of making any major adjustments to the schedule. It could actually do more harm than good. But having said that, we do have opportunities to bring our capacity down for August. At this point, it's pretty challenging to give you a real clear estimate for September, but the demand environment that we're seeing in August is carrying over into September, and demand for fall travel has slowed considerably over the past several weeks as well. The September schedule was originally published with capacity down 10% to 15% year over year. We just recently republished September and brought it down an additional 11 points. So September's current public schedule is down roughly 20% to 25% year over year. But again, given the demand environment, we intend to be more aggressive in reducing the September schedule. So over Q3, capacity is currently planned, down 20% to 30%, but we know we have more work to bring it down further. And the approach that we take with capacity cuts is very specific, and we're going right down to the market and the flight level. And if we have a flight that covers variable costs and maintain strong itineraries in the market, it probably makes sense, and we're probably better off continuing to have that flight in the schedule in most cases. But at the end of the day, the demand environment has to support the capacity and vice versa. And our focus right now continues to be on achieving a sustainable level of cash breakeven or better. Very quickly, I want to give you a quick update on our Southwest business initiatives, and it's very obvious that business travel is down dramatically right now, and we think it's going to take several years for business travel to recover. But we also know that we under-indexed in a pretty significant way in the managed corporate travel business. So as business travel begins to recover, the size of the market, the size of the pie may be smaller for a period of time, but we intend to have a bigger slice of that pie. So we're continuing to make a lot of progress with our GDS deployments. We are now live in Travelport's Apollo, Worldspan and Galileo platforms, and we will be live on Amadeus before year-end. And we're taking advantage of the slowdown in business travel. We're doing a lot of work with the TMCs and corporate travel managers across the country. And we're seeing tremendous, tremendous support to have the Southwest product available to them on industry standard GDS platforms. You may have seen that earlier this week, we announced that we will be terminating our GDS relationship with Sabre at the end of the year. We have been working with Sabre for, I don't know, nearly two years, trying to get a contract in place that will allow us to have a full functionality within the Sabre platform. And we just have not been able to get there, so we are terminating our contract. We'll be sunsetting our Sabre GDS channel at the end of the year. The Sabre product that we're currently using has very limited functionality and it's part ministry standard which makes it difficult for TMCs and corporate travel managers to work with. It's also, by far -- and this is important, it's also by far the smallest by a long shot of our business channels. And most of the customers that use this channel also book on Southwest through our other channels as well. So we feel confident that we'll be able to recapture most of the revenue through our new GDS platforms. So we've announced this six months in advance, so we can begin working with our customers on a conversion process. We want to have them up and going as the business recovers, and I think we're going to be in a very strong position to grow our market share and our presence in the corporate market. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out our comments today with an overview of our cost performance, our liquidity, cash burn and fleet before we open it up for questions. Before I begin, I also want to say a big thank you to all of our incredible teams. This might be the toughest challenge we've ever faced in our history, at least during my career at Southwest. But there is a reason we refer to our employees as warriors. I just couldn't imagine a more talented and determined group of people to be working alongside as we fight to overcome this crisis to keep southwest healthy and strong for decades to come. Coming into the second quarter, our top financial priority was to boost liquidity and reduce cash burn to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our business. With our revenue production down dramatically, we took swift action to reduce spend. We essentially eliminated our capital spend, apart from key investments in important projects, such as GDS we deferred or canceled nonessential discretionary spend. And we implemented voluntary and unpaid fleet program with strong take rates, as Bob already covered. And as Mike covered, we did all of this while running a high-quality operation, and our people took great care of our customers. For our second quarter alone, our actions resulted in savings of $3.5 billion in spend versus what we were planning coming into this year. Our second-quarter cost performance and cash spending were in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of our last earnings call. And excluding several items, our second-quarter nominal expenses decreased 36% year over year and decreased nearly 40% versus our pre pandemic plan. And that was on a year-over-year capacity decline of 55%. And our average course cash spend came in around $34 million per day in second quarter. As a reminder, our original pre-pandemic outlook for second-quarter core cash spend was in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. So the swift actions taken to reduce our costs were very meaningful. In addition to the operating expense relief as a result of lower capacity, lower fuel prices continued to help. Our second-quarter fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down $0.80 or 38% year over year. And while recent fuel prices have increased from the low seen in first quarter, we're continuing to see significant year over year relief from lower energy prices. Lower market fuel prices saved us $153 million in second quarter alone compared to market price outlooks at the beginning of this year. For our third quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range with nearly $300 million in savings from the decrease in market prices since the beginning of the year and significantly lower than last year's third quarter fuel price of $2.07 per gallon. We do not have forward risk. So our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices. While we have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our second-quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year over year at $24 million, spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. This higher premium cost per gallon will continue to be higher by default as long as capacity is down. But the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged. In addition, to lower fuel prices, our fuel efficiency improved 14.5% year over year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. Lower load factors and a less congested airspace leading to less taxi and idle ground time and better on-time performance. Excluding fuel and special items, second-quarter operating costs were down 24% year over year. We saw significant relief in our variable flight driven nonfuel expenses primarily in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We have cut spending in virtually every category. Our 2020 operating expenses are now expected to be down over $2.7 billion this year compared with original plans, and this includes the benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from lower capacity. We had several special items in second quarter that we covered in this morning's press release. First, we had a fuel hedge special item that resulted in $21 million of expense that has been excluded from our second-quarter results. Second, we recognized a 225 -- $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions and other operating expenses. And as a reminder, this covered 10 737-800 aircraft and 10 737 MAX 8 aircraft. These were essentially financing transactions as part of our efforts to bolster liquidity, and the quality of the aircraft and market conditions resulted in the sizable gain. And third, we had $1.1 billion of payroll support program proceeds allocated to second quarter that were an offset to salary wages and benefits net against an accrual of $307 million related to our voluntary separation program. We've already covered the specifics on the take rates on the voluntary programs, but I want to add my thank you to the employees that elected to participate. Looking at third quarter, we expect the remaining $1.2 billion in payroll support program proceeds to be recorded as an offset to salary wages and benefits as well as an estimated charge in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion related to voluntary employee programs, as Bob covered. Nearly half of the cash payouts for the voluntary separation program will occur by year-end, and we expect overall savings of both programs to far exceed the upfront cost. Overall, we had a stellar second-quarter cost performance, and it is truly a testament to the swift actions and intense focus by the entire Southwest team. Based on current plans for third quarter 2020 capacity to decrease in the range of 20% to 30% year over year, third quarter operating expenses excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 10% to 20% year over year. This represents a sequential increase from second quarter driven primarily by higher flight-driven expenses and certainly are modest relative to the sequential increase in capacity. With regard to our capital spend forecast, we have more than offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of capex originally planned for this year. The reduction is driven by our 2020 and 2021 fleet delivery agreement with Boeing, canceling or deferring the majority of capital investment projects originally planned for this year; and supplier proceeds and sale leaseback proceeds, both of which we consider as reductions to aircraft capex. In regards to our fleet, I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years. Our latest agreement with Boeing and our current planning assumptions are that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We don't have the specifics finalized with Boeing yet, and that is by design, as the agreement gives us time and flexibility to continue monitoring demand and fleet needs for the next 18 months. There have been no formal updates to our contractual book order with Boeing yet, and the order book included in our first-quarter 10-Q is still reflective of the overall contractual agreement with orders and options for more than 330 MAX aircraft through the end of 2026, in addition to the no more than 48 we are evaluating for 2020 and 2021 combined. At some point, we'll need to adjust 2020 and 2021 deliveries down and shift delivery slots by year, but we have not canceled any of our orders or options with Boeing over the life of the agreement. We are well positioned to be nimble and rightsizing our fleet, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or to return aircraft to service and ramp up our capacity once the environment allows. Moving now to liquidity. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.5 billion, and we currently have a cash balance of $14 billion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised more than $10 billion to further bolster our cash reserves. In addition to financing and sale-leaseback transactions, we raised $2.2 billion through a common stock offering and have received $2.9 billion in payroll support program proceeds. And the remaining $326 million is expected by the end of this month. We also paid back our $1 billion revolver and paid off our $3.7 billion one year secured term loan which released $4.5 billion in aircraft collateral. We now have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program, I'll just point out. In addition, we noted in our press release this morning that we have signed a letter of intent with the U.S. treasury to apply for a $2.8 billion loan as part of the Cares Act. We are not committed to taking this loan, and we haven't decided that we will take the loan yet. Signing the letter of intent was just part of the process to keep this loan as a backstop, should we determine we need it down the road. Taking into account 2020 operating expense. Savings of over $2.7 billion, the cash saved through the suspension of dividends and share repurchases and reduce capital spending, we have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by over $7 billion versus plan. That is very meaningful, and it took the teamwork of all of our employees to make such a big and impactful shift in such a short amount of time. Of course, these changes are necessary to manage our core cash burn, and we are doing just that. To clarify, our core cash spend, I already covered for second quarter, is meant to quantify the true run rate of our ongoing cost. Our average core cash burn takes our spending and incorporates the benefit of operating revenues net of trip cancellations. For second quarter, our average core cash burn was $23 million per day with a rate of $16 million per day in June, a little ahead of the guidance due to solid cost control and revenue trends holding up well for the vast majority of the month. Our current estimate for core cash burn for July is approximately $18 million per day, with third quarter estimated to be similar to second quarter's $23 million per day. As core cash burn remains our focus, we will continue to explore opportunities to improve our burn rate as we are currently doing with our reevaluation of our August and September flight schedule. In closing, we have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies even after debt raises. We are in a net cash position of over $4 billion with a leverage of 49%, and our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We came into this crisis in a strong position and have bolstered our liquidity to put us in an even stronger competitive position to manage through this uncertain time and to thrive out on the other side of this crisis. While no one knows how the pandemic will continue to unfold in the coming months, from where we sit today, I am encouraged by the resilience and determination of our people, and we remain laser-focused on taking care of our employees customers and our shareholders. With that, Chad, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hi everybody. Thank you. Gary, do you view not taking the Cares Act loan and consequences that may come with it, whether that's brain drain or regulatory, as a potential competitive advantage for Southwest over the next two to three years? Gary Kelly : Yes, Hunter. I would say that that is one element of it. I think we're trying to rack up as many competitive advantages as we can. Fortunately, Tammy got this question earlier this morning, but we've got very high-quality financings in place. We've done two senior unsecured deals at very reasonable interest rates. So it's evidence of our ability to access the capital markets. We've got -- we've unleashed some collateral that we had to pledge early on during the crisis with a couple of different bank term loan deals that we were doing, but all that has been freed up. So at this point, we've got $12 million in collateral available, $10 million of that is in airplanes. So the -- as I'm sure you know, the terms of the government loan are pretty onerous including a significant file of warrants. So yes, I think we would much rather avoid those. And I think what's near and dear to shareholders' hearts is it puts restrictions on dividends which I object to, and share repurchases. I object to that as well. We're not paying dividends and share -- buying back shares now. But obviously, we'd like to have that flexibility in the future, and I'm sure you would too. So there's a lot of reasons why we'd like to avoid that. And if our competitors have it, absolutely, I think it puts them at a disadvantage. Hunter Keay : Thank you. And then it's interesting, the MAX problem probably made you question whether or not you should continue with the single fleet type, but now in the coronavirus, you're probably relieved that you don't have a second fleet type. So first of all, is that a fair statement? And then would love your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that going forward? Thank you. Gary Kelly : I think -- and Tom may want to chime in too, from a strategic standpoint. But if you just look at our overall business model, we looked at it again and challenged ourselves whether we needed to make fundamental changes in this environment. And we have concluded quite the opposite, that we're in a very strong position. And I would put the fleet strategy in that conceptually as well. I know that Mike believes that the MAX is the best narrow-body airplane in the world. It's frustrating that it's been on the sidelines all this time. But certainly, the lack of complexity oriented around having a single fleet type is extremely helpful. This is a low cost environment. It's another opportunity to sustain that. We'll have to continue to evaluate our fleet strategy separate from our overall business model going forward, but it's a high hurdle to overcome to commit to a second fleet type. One of these days, I assume that the company will, but it's certainly not obvious that that's anything we need to do anytime soon. So yes, short answer is I do think that that's a welcome advantage currently. Tom Nealon : It is kind of interesting when you step back going through this COVID thing, you get it -- you're pretty introspective sometimes. You have to step back and look at it. I'll tell you what I think, and this is part of the restructuring work. But I feel like our network is fundamentally very, very sound and very, very strong. I feel like our business strategy, but you have to go back and look at is you're looking at restructuring is very, very fundamentally sound and secure. And a measure of how it couldn't be is based on a very efficient operation which is where the 737 comes in. It's based on low cost which is where the 737 comes in. It's based on low fares which does drive our low cost which is where the 737 comes in. So as we go back as part of our restructuring, think about our fundamental strategy. Our core corporate strategy remains very, very sound and intact, and that's what we're going to build on in terms of the restructuring work going forward. And maybe even believe that it's more appropriate than ever for the current environment. So actually, we're very, very confident, but we've got to get more passengers. There's no getting around that. Operator : And the next question will come from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Darryl Genovesi : Hi everybody. Thanks for the time. Hey Tammy, I don't think you guys provided a reconciliation table for your cash burn number for the second quarter. Can you just help us understand exactly how you're getting to that $23 million per day because -- I mean it says in your -- it says in your footnote that you're backing out debt service obligations, but I think you also paid -- you made a few principal payments that weren't necessarily obligations. They were early payments. So can you just comment on the extent to which those are included? And generally, how you're getting to that number? Tammy Romo : Yes and no. I'd be happy to take you through that. Really, just to kind of start off with, our core cash burn, as I mentioned, is really intended to be our ongoing spend. So we include -- our operating expenses are a good proxy for our cash expenses. And then we include our kind of normal amortization of debt. So we do factor that in as well. So really, it's just, for the most part, our operating expenses, cash operating expenses less our revenue, and we adjust that for the amortization of debt and interest and so forth. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. I'm still having a little trouble getting into them. Maybe Ryan and I can talk about it. We can talk about it offline after. Tammy Romo : Yes. We'll be happy to take you through that in detail, but that's essentially it. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then I think you said that you're still working through some things with Boeing. Does that mean that that 48 delivery number for the next couple of years is still subject to meaningful downward revision? Tammy Romo : Yes. We're -- right now, based on the demand environment, we would likely shift some of those out, as I mentioned earlier. We -- of course, right now, we don't have a firm date on getting the MAX back into service. As Mike mentioned, that's probably kind of a best case maybe the end of December, that could shift into next year. We just don't know yet. So we've got some work to do with Boeing, but to really -- the point is, and we have the flexibility to shift that out. So that's -- so the quick answer to your question is yes, we have flexibility there. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Good afternoon everybody. First question, probably for Gary. So American believes that its intellectual property and its website are worth about half as much as their loyalty program which is a source of liquidity that at least we had not been contemplating. Why wouldn't your IP co similarly represent several billion dollars of potential liquidity? Gary Kelly : I suppose it is. I think again we're able to do senior unsecured, where we don't have to pledge anything and other than our good looks and our credit. So we -- I'm happy that those things are potentially available to us, but I don't think we need them. We've got $15.5 billion in liquidity. That needs to be more than enough to see us through. And we've got a pristine balance sheet, still low overall interest carrying. So that's all good, but we don't need it. Jamie Baker : All good points. Second question, a topic that came up on the Alaska call was the compstat of getting back to pre COVID ex fuel CASM, but on lower than pre-COVID capacity. And I admit it's something that I hadn't really been thinking about. Basically, the idea was that a smaller industry wouldn't face the same operational constraints as it once did. There's probably some pilot juniorization in there given early retirements. We didn't really dive into the moving pieces. I guess my question is whether your internal plan has Southwest returning to pre-COVID CASM before you get to pre-COVID capacity? And if it doesn't, why shouldn't it? Gary Kelly : Pre-COVID CASM or earlier than pre-COVID capacity? Jamie Baker : Yes. Basically, you'd get back to pre COVID ex fuel CASM before, you grew the network. You grew the area status up to the corresponding level. Yes. Gary Kelly : We -- I agree with that. The only thing that I -- because I know that we have incurred some cost -- some significant cost reductions would be point number one. What I think we would be -- to give your question serious consideration, I think what we would need to -- what I would at least need to think through is what things are timing and simply deferred as opposed to more permanent reductions. One thing that I would want to -- first of all, I think it's fair to admit, we don't have a plan per say. So this has turned the world upside down. So we're in -- we're like a patient in intensive care. And we are working to get out of intensive care, and it's a 30, 60, 90 kind of a time horizon. We're debating right now, as an example, what kind of \"plan\" that it's worth even working on for fiscal 2021. So right now, we've got a laser focus on getting the company to breakeven cash flow. So that's -- and that's going to take -- it's a volatile -- more volatility than we've ever experienced. That's going to take a lot of management. It's going to take a lot of iterations. And certainly, one way or the other, it's got to take more passengers. You just can't cut your way to breakeven. So hopefully, that's instructive. However, I like the direction that you're headed because we do -- we have discovered some efficiencies. The working from home as an example, is pretty interesting. I think that it will allow us the opportunity to consider avoiding some capex in the future, whether it's building a parking garage or expanding buildings or whatever it might be. So I think there are clear opportunities there. I think that the way that Bob Jordan has led the voluntary separation program has probably allowed us some structural cost reduction across our pay scales because they're very senior people that are electing to take that. So yes. It's probably -- again, it's a somewhat stream of consciousness to your question, but that -- I like your thought, and that ought to be an objective of ours. I just think in fairness to your question, we have not done the work to be able to prove that. But clearly, in this environment, we need to keep our cost -- we need to crush the cost down and need to be imagining and innovating like never before so that we can pull that off. One of the things I worry about, quite frankly, is that we've cut investments to the bone. And in terms of just the digital world and opportunities there which we have significant ones, we put those on hold. So at the appropriate time, we'll want to come back to that and make sure that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot on that. But that's a question that's a little too early to give you a specific answer. Jamie Baker : Sure. Sure. A lot of moving pieces, but I really, really appreciate your commentary, Gary. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Joe Caiado : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks very much. My first question is on the MAX, probably for Mike. How did the latest steps by the FAA this week in their recertification effort, based on everything that you've seen, how do the proposed changes to things like pilot training compared with your expectations relative to the rough time lines and the phases that you've described for us in the past, Mike, in terms of what you need to do once you get the green light from the FAA? And I'm really asking about changes to the proposed -- I'm not asking about sort of the delays driven by something like the addition of a public comment period or anything like that. Mike Van de Ven : So are you asking whether or not our into service plan is increased or extended because of harsher requirements? Joe Caiado : Yes, in any way or shortened. I mean... Mike Van de Ven : Or shortened. Yes, we have constant communication with the project teams over there. And what I would tell you is that there's nothing in the return-to-service work, whether it's maintenance work on the aircraft or pilot training or other things like that that are adding any significant length to our time frame. So as I said, I think it will take us a couple of months to get that airplane back into service. And the biggest thing on the time line, it really is the pilot training. We think that we can get that training event done per pilot in a day, and we have nine simulators available to go do that. So we think it will take us somewhere around nine or 10 weeks to get our pilots trained. And then after that, we can get most of the rest of the work done within that time frame. Joe Caiado : Got it. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then my second question is a GDS question. Are you walking away entirely from discussions with Sabre? Are you just saying it's not going to happen, so let's sever all ties or do you sort of continue discussions between now and the end of the year? I'm just curious, even if you can reach a new agreement with Sabre, what's the downside to leaving the old sort of BBR agreement in place? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. I think the downside to continue on BBR is just a continuation of an old platform that we want to begin to move our customers to industry standard platforms, and that's where they want to go. So that's one of it. But I think in terms of continuing on with the conversations with Sabre, I've worked with Sabre since 2001 or 2002. It's always a challenge. It's a good company, but they're challenging to work with. We've been working for two years to get a contract. And at some point, you just need to call it and move forward. And again, to move forward with platforms and to companies you can do business with. So we're still using Sabre to get their product. We are still using some data -- or some of Sabre's data translation and migration products. So Sabre is a good technology company. We've just had a really tough time cracking the nut on how we conduct business, one with the other, in this GDS world. So that's where we are. So there are no conversations going on at this point. I don't expect there to be any conversations going at this point for some period of time. But we felt we can't do it, so. Gary Kelly : And we have options. We've got lots of others. We have fantastic options. And we're going to push these new options we have really, really aggressively. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. It's interesting. Amadeus is the world's largest GDS. They have a very, very small presence in the U.S. today. They are quite hungry to build a very strong U.S. presence. Now we're going to have them up and live well before the end of the year. Travelport is resurgent, and they have three good platforms. So to Gary's point, we do have options. This -- back to Sabre is a good company. It's just not working out for us with them in this category. But I'm OK with where we are. We'll be able to hit our objectives. It may take a little bit longer, but we'll be able to hit our objectives. Operator : We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just a clarification first and then another question. On the clarification side, with the Cares loan, is this a situation where the treasury is allowing you to finalize the loan if you wanted to and then defer the draw so you don't have to issue warrants? Tammy Romo : We are in discussions with the treasury now. We have signed the term sheet, as you all know, but we're really still in discussions to finalize that. It may be that we have to take a small percentage of the loan on September 30, but we're just -- we're -- it's just a little too early to say for sure because we haven't finalized that yet with treasury. Gary Kelly : But we're not obligated too. Tammy Romo : We're not obligated. We have on September 30. There may be some small draw required on September 30, but we would have until later, close to the end of March, to draw down on that. So still working through all that. And we should obviously have that process worked through in the coming weeks. Gary Kelly : But again, our intent right now is to take zero and not have the any government loan, just to be clear. Tammy Romo : That's right. That's right. Gary Kelly : And so until September 30, that is our option. Myles Walton : Makes perfect sense. Okay. And then maybe another one on the blocked middle seats, you've extended it until October. I'm just curious, do you have a cost or lost revenue that's actually impacting over that period of time, in any way, shape or form? Gary Kelly : It's kind of interesting. The -- our intent is not to do this forever, nor do our customers expect for us to do this forever. So we're going to have play this by ear and see what sentiment looks like on that kind of thing. But honestly, at this point, if we weren't blocked in the middle seat, our load factors aren't such that we're foregoing any revenue, right? So it's not really costing us right now. What has cost us something is adding in the 6,900 additional sections or flights to cover those flights that did reach capacity, why lose the demand? So we put flights in to capture that. As I said, 80% cover their costs, so we're profitable. It was a handsome profit. 20% didn't. In that 20%, probably represented $5 million or so for the quarter, and it's probably 4% or 5% near capacity points of ASMs, if you will. So pretty modest, but net the 80% that was favorable against the 20% of the cost was $5 million, it was an easy decision. So I think we're in a good position with that. Myles Walton : That's perfect. Thanks. Ryan Martinez : All right. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the Q&A. If you guys have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me, and thank you for joining today. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad and welcome to all of our media members who are on the call today. We'll go ahead and get started with the media Q&A portion of our call today. So Chad, if you'll give them instructions on how to queue up for a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead. Leslie Josephs : Hope you are well. On the payment support, just given the number of people that are taking voluntary time off or separating from the company, do you expect to have any money left over? I'm just looking at how the labor bill or the salaries bill costs were cheaper in Q2 '20 versus 2019? I'm just not sure how you recognize that. Gary Kelly : No. No, they're -- if you're saying, will -- once we pay our salaries through to September 30, will there still be PSP money? The answer is no. I think going into this, the way the treasury department kind of sized it all up is that Tammy Romo, our CFO, and her folks, put in a grant request for an amount of money. And basically, the treasury came back and said, we'll give you 76% of what you asked for. And that was all based on again projections for what our spending would be. But the point being is the PSP, while is very welcome and very appreciated, it's far below what our actual spending for salaries, wages and benefits will turn out to be. So there's no leftover. It's the opposite. Leslie Josephs : Okay. I just wasn't sure. The way the salaries, wages benefits is lower than last year. So I wasn't sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi. I was wondering if you could -- if you could share anything about kind of where things stand with discussions with TSA about temperature checks? It seems like there's a lot of energy behind that. And then lately, it's been pretty quiet. Gary Kelly : Well, there is energy behind that, speaking for Southwest Airlines. And personally, I'm a huge advocate for it. And Linda I think just this week, if not today, we are beginning our prototype with Dallas Love Field to test that. And Alison, it is for the sole purpose of trying to demonstrate to the TSA the efficacy of the process and so forth. So the Airlines for America is unanimous in its support for the temperature checks. So we have not lost our enthusiasm. I can't speak for the administration. So I wish they would take it up and get this done. It's one more layer of safety and defense against spreading the virus. Obviously, things aren't going the way we'd like in the United States in terms of cases, so I'm anxious to get moving on this. So no lack of enthusiasm on our part. Alison Sider : Thanks. And if I could ask you one more on the MAX. Just curious, under their new CEO this year, if you've noticed any sort of improvement or change in communication or scheduling or sort of how that whole process is going? Gary Kelly : Do you want to talk about that, Mike? Mike Van de Ven : We know Mr. Calhoun well and have a long relationship with him. So our communication has been open with him. We knew Dennis well also, so we had good communications with Dennis. So I wouldn't say we've had -- Boeing has been a good partner with us through this. They've kept us informed of what's going on. They have -- the lines of communication are open. We talk to them each week about the process and have stayed pretty close with them on it, so no complaints in terms of the communication. Operator : And the next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tracy Rucinski : Aside from temperature checks, are there any other safety measures that you would like Washington to mandate? Gary Kelly : Mike, chime in. I don't -- none come to mind. We -- the only thing that I've been asked today several times is on mandating mask. And I don't agree with mandating mask for airline travel and singling it out. I think if we're going to mandate mask, we have to mandate masks everywhere. But aside from that, Mike, I don't know of anything else that we are pursuing. We're doing a lot. I mean we're doing deep cleaning. We've got the Hepa filters in the cabin. We're doing -- we're one of the few airlines in the world who is not booking airlines full for physical distancing. We've got Plexiglass shields up. We're doing physical distancing in the airport. I think that the missing piece to me is the temperature check. And you hear all these school districts and superintendents talking about going back-to-school in the fall and their list of protocols, they're following the airlines' leads, and they're all pursuing temperature checks. So I think that's the one thing that would be very sensible to add. Mike, is there anything you can point to? Mike Van de Ven : No. No. No other here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Slotnick with Business Insider. Please go ahead. David Slotnic : Hi everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. I wanted to just clarify, you said that there were 48 aircraft that you'd be taking delivery of through 2021. Is that the original plan or is that after pushing some of those back? Mike Van de Ven : We -- this is Mike. We had -- we just had an agreement with Boeing that we would take no more than 48 aircraft in 2020 and 2021. And that was back at a time where the return to service was projected to be earlier for the MAX than it is today. So those are some of the discussions that we need to have with Boeing and with the COVID-19 environment that we have and the delay of the MAX, what that looks like. So it feels to us like 48 is the maximum. And that we probably have a need for something less than that. Okay. David Slotnic : Okay. So that would have involved deferrals or anything that would carry a financial penalty Mike Van de Ven : No, it's really just -- it's just really trying to get an order book, a delivery sequence that we all agree with. Gary Kelly : Yes. I think the way to visualize the situation with Boeing is that, basically, where we go from here needs to be negotiated, period. It's almost like we don't have a firm contract for deliveries. So all of that has to be completely reset because Boeing is out of compliance with their contract. David Slotnic : Got you. Okay. That makes sense. And then just the only other thing, if looking at the numbers of people who've taken the long-term leaves and the voluntary separations, is there a scenario in which any of the major work groups would not be furloughs or layoffs starting next year? Gary Kelly : Well, let me make sure I'm understanding your question. Are you -- so first of all, we have not decided that we will furlough or lay off anyone, OK? And then if your question is, could there be furloughs among certain work groups and not others I think certainly, conceptually, anything is possible there. In other words, we could find that certain work groups are not overstaffed, other work groups are. I think anything, at least in my mind, it's contract by contract. And then we have a large population of noncontract employees also where we have more flexibility as to how we can think about these things in their favor, quite frankly. So -- but we'll have -- we have plans and ideas about what we would pursue if we're faced with that prospect. But right now obviously we're working very hard to avoid it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Edward Russell with TPG. Please go ahead. Edward Russell : Hi. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more clarity on how big you expect Southwest to be at the end of the year? I mean you talked about people being down about 25%. Does that mean capacity should be down about 25%? Just give more color to that. Gary Kelly : Yes. Yes, that's the way to think about it. And all of that is a work in progress. And as we were -- if you were listening to the analyst portion, we're -- we had, on June 30, we had a great plan for August. And now three weeks in, we're finding that August has changed significantly. And so we're just going to have to be prepared to have a lot of volatility and have to be prepared to make frequent adjustments because it's really almost impossible to plan right now. But yes, the rule of thumb that you should be using is that we'll be lowering our capacity in the fourth quarter, roughly 25%. And if demand is like it is today, that won't be enough. We'll need to be smaller than that. Tom, I don't know if -- and Mike, if we can be bigger than that. I.e., more capacity than that. I think you have some flexibility there, but we're probably capped at about 75%-ish, it seems to me, with our voluntary exit program. Edward Russell : Got it. So one quick follow-up. What about Hawaii? Do -- will Hawaii be part of -- will fly your main down or do you have any updates on your Hawaii service plan? Tom Nealon : Well, yes. Just real quick. This is Tom. We're pretty excited about getting back to Hawaii. And I think our -- I get the quarantines are moving so frequently. I'm getting them all confused. But I think Hawaii was -- were planned to having service return in September, if I'm not mistaken. And we're going to begin to restore so today, we're really kind of a final service level of service. Very -- two flights from the mainland to Hawaii and a few inner islands, that's about it. We're really excited to be in to get that back into our pre-COVID. We're going to build the Hawaii, California market and the inner island market. That's what we were slated to do. Governor Ige I think very appropriately, extended the quarantine. So we pulled that back. But we're excited to get back to Hawaii as soon as we're allowed. And I think the same thing is true with the international travel, as soon as things are good to go, we're anxious to get back in those businesses as well. But today, we're only serving I think Cancun, Montego Bay and Cabo. So we're anxious to get going, but it's just not time right now, but we will. Operator : And the next question comes from Randy Diamond with San Antonio Express News. Please go ahead. Randy Diamond : Thank you for your time. The -- originally, Southwest had said that by the end of the year, they hope to double the number of flights at San Antonio International and go back from about 20 a day to about 50. Is that now off with the demand not as great? Tom Nealon : Yes. I think what you're seeing is -- we're not picking out San Antonio. In fact, our CEO's from San Antonio... Gary Kelly : Love San Antonio and the Express-News. Tom Nealon : Yes. But we just had to pull back our network pretty significantly. So typically, we're running 4,000, 4,200 flights a day. We're somewhere around half of that. So we've had to contract. Now we've done this without closing any stations or any cities, but we've had to pull our flying in. So San Antonio is one of the markets where we're doing that. So we're anxious to get it back up to its prior capacity levels though once demand is there. Gary Kelly : And to just sort of inferring the perspective that you're coming from, well, this is one thing that we're trying to do for our customers. And I would say that we are in a stronger position than our competitors. We're trying to continue to offer your community a very good flight schedule. And that's the balance we're trying to strike here is match supply with lower demand, but not cut the supply so much where you have virtually no good flight options. So I think you'll still -- regardless. I think you'll still have a very good flight schedule in San Antonio. And I think like Tom mentioned, we haven't cut -- we haven't eliminated service to any of our domestic markets including Hawaii for that matter and don't intend to at this point. I can't promise that into perpetuity, but whether we're back to full capacity in San Antonio at year-end or not, you'll still have a good flight schedule. Randy Diamond : Well, just following up, if you have around 22 flights a day, would we see a further reduction by the end of the year or do you think it will stay steady? Tom Nealon : I'd rather not try to lead you. I think if we can get and stick with down 25%, I think you'll have a good flight schedule. Exactly how that will compare to where we are today, I don't think we know. It's just too complicated, trying to schedule an airline and optimize it as infinite solutions. And it is peculiar sometimes how things end up with some markets have more flights and less flights, and so I don't think there's any way to give you a good answer on that. I think just trying to -- like golf, just trying to get on the green here is just trying to say that you will still have a very viable flight schedule. And something that we -- again, you would be happy with and we'd be proud of. But I can't give you a specific answer. Randy Diamond : And finally, on the reservation center, we have a reservation center in San Antonio, where you employ 900 people. So the no layoffs, furloughs extends also to that reservation center? Gary Kelly : Yes, through the whole company through the end of the year. Randy Diamond : Okay. Thank you. Tom Nealon : And they are awesome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thanks Chad, and appreciate you all being with us today. If you have any other follow-up questions, please feel free to reach to our communications group, 214-792-4847 or you can visit us at www.swamedia.com. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. May name is Chad and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Chad. And I appreciate you all joining us for our third quarter call. In just a moment, we will share our remarks with you and then open it up for Q&A. So, you will hear a comprehensive update today from our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven; our President, Tom Nealon; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Just a few quick reminders. We will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. We also had several special items in our third quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks today. We have all of those spelled out in our press release from this morning regarding special items, forward-looking statements, non-GAAP reconciliations to GAAP results and other important risk factors and of course you can find our press release and other helpful resources at our Investor Relations website. And now we\u2019ll go ahead and get started and I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call for 2020. Obviously, we can't be happy or satisfied with the loss. But I'm going to tell you upfront some of the things that I'm happy and grateful for. Number one, the record loss was significantly less than I feared three months ago. We got past the July wobble in demand. Number two, our outlook for fourth quarter reflects a continuation of this improvement, better revenues, lower cost compared to the third quarter and assuming our October trends hold for November and December and that's of course also assuming that we have stable fuel prices. Number three, we have announced nine new destinations to be added over the next three quarters. I'm happy to have these opportunities. I'm happy to play offense. I'm happy to generate more revenue on minimal incremental cost, which means more cash. And I'm happy to put idle aircraft and excess staff to work. Number four I'm happy that there is still a chance that we can preserve pay, jobs and service by Congress extending the Payroll Support Program for another six months. Getting that support extended is a top priority. I\u2019m hopeful that it will happen quickly so we can terminate work on our plan B, which is to press our unions to sacrifice with concessions in order to prevent furloughs as we currently are roughly 20% over staffed. Number five, I am happy that finally we seem to be nearing the ungrounding of the MAX. Number six, I\u2019m happy that we have the scientific evidence to provide comfort and assurance that it is safe to unblock the middle seats, which will happen on December 1, and the scientific support arrives as demand continues to improve, which should absorb our 50% increase in seats offered for sale. And our models show that this will be revenue, cost and operating profit positive and that all makes me happy too. I'm happy that we have at least three years of cash and I know its borrowed money but that should see us through this crisis and if we have to, we can borrow more. Number eight, I\u2019m happy that we're uniquely prepared for this environment with our business model. We have low cost, low fares, no hidden fees and nothing to hide, no second class, the nation's best route system, the nation's largest airline, 97% domestic and better prepared than ever to serve business travelers when they return to the skies. And then, finally, I am enormously grateful for our people. They've done a phenomenal job monitoring and adjusting this airline. They've done a phenomenal job running a superb, safe, on time, high quality operation. They've done a phenomenal job serving our customers with industry-leading hospitality. And finally, I'm grateful for their resilience and their perseverance and their devotion to our cause. Our leaders are going to continue to do everything in their power to take care of all the people who have built and operate this airline and serve our customers every day. Job one is keeping our Company financially strong and healthy and with perpetual competitive advantages. Those are a sampling of my favorite things. And yes, the worst may be behind us. And I hope there are no more surprises. And yes, we have a long way to go, but we will get through this. We will survive this, and we will emerge with the best balance sheet and the best business model to compete and thrive in the post-pandemic world. And Mike, Tom and Tammy have a lot to share with you. So, I'm going to wrap up and turn it over to Mr. Mike Van de Ven. Mike Van de Ven : Well, thanks, Gary. Gary Kelly : And go ahead and gloat over the operations, Mike, because it is absolutely superb. Mike Van de Ven : Well, I hope that's one of the things that's also made you happy. So, this quarter really was the first full quarter of the year where each day our plan was to operate all the flights as scheduled. We were able to get out in front of the schedule changes that we made during the quarter, and we got our crew schedules and airport staffing adjusted. We had all of our customers re-accommodated well in advance of that actual operation. And so as a result, the operational performance was just magnificent. It was arguably the best overall performance in Southwest history note. Pre-Labor Day, we were flying roughly 2,800 trips a day, post-Labor Day, around 2,000. And we published just over 19,000 extra flight sections during the quarter. And our on-time performance for the quarter was 94.4%. That led the industry, our best performance since 1992. Our bag handling was the best in our history. We carried roughly 12.4 million bags, and we only had a bag claim for a lost or damaged bag for about 0.02% of them. So, that's two claims for every thousand bags carried, and that is superb service, and you don't have to pay extra for it. The reliability of our service and hospitality of our people resulted in a Net Promoter Score of 80.7%, and that's the highest in our history. So it's just a testament to our people. This environment was full of pandemics, politics, social issues, general anxiety, and our people, they come to work, they take care of our customers, they take care of each other, they take care of Southwest Airlines, and I'm just very, very proud of our Southwest team. So in addition to running a very reliable operation, we are equally focused on cost efficiency. We executed both voluntary separation and extended time-off programs in the third quarter. Those programs were very successful. They reduced our operational staffing just over 25%, as we begin the fourth quarter. We have roughly 730 airplanes on property. We have about 100 of those in long-term storage. That includes the 34 MAX aircraft. And those aircraft were selected based on their maintenance profiles and the near-term heavy checks. And so, the point of all that is that we can cover the variation of daily flight activity in the fourth quarter at optimal staffing and optimal aircraft maintenance profiles, while continuing to produce very high on-time performance results. We've actually been doing some extensive operations research into the cost of executing the flight schedules at varying staffing levels and aircraft productivity levels and on-time levels. And historically, we'd assume that an on-time performance in the low-80s really optimized our cost profiles. But some of the most recent research that we've been doing is indicating that our optimal cost profile may occur when our on-time performance is in the upper-80s. So, that's really an exciting opportunity that we would have that would foundationally improve both schedule reliability for our customers and our employees as well as minimizing our operational cost execution. So turning to the MAX, several major milestones have been completed. The certification flights are done. The Joint Operations Evaluation Board has met. They've given their recommendations for training. The Flight Standardization Board has considered them. They've issued their draft report for pilot training requirements. And that report is out for comment through November 2. And after that, a final report needs to be issued. There's bound to be a couple of open regulatory items that they need to be addressed, but ultimately, an airworthiness directive and instructions need to be issued that would allow for an ungrounding. As you know, there is no timeline. But we're hopeful that that happens before the end of the year, but it could be early next year. In any event, our process is the same as we've previously discussed. We have to put all these requirements into our manuals. We have to receive FAA approval. We have to schedule and complete pilot training for roughly 7,000 pilots. We have maintenance work to do to bring our own MAX aircraft out of long-term storage and into an operational status. And we'll be doing operational readiness and validation flights on the aircraft before the return to revenue service. We also have 34 undelivered aircraft from Boeing that they've currently built, and we're working with them on an updated delivery schedule. Our process is going to be deliberate, structured, and we're expecting it to take three months to four months between the ungrounding and the aircraft being in revenue service. When they are ready for revenue service, they'll replace the 700s. We've got significant operational experience with the aircraft. It is our most cost-effective aircraft. It is our most reliable aircraft. It is our most environmentally-friendly aircraft. And it's our most comfortable aircraft. So, we really look forward to flying it again. So in closing, I think we really settled into a rhythm in the third quarter with even more stability in our schedules in the fourth quarter. Our aircraft and our people resources are better aligned with our commercial needs. Our customers are getting the best value in the industry, low fares and superb reliability, and that's delivered by our kind and caring people that will treat our customers like family and keep them safe during their journey. And that's the Southwest Team, and as I said, I\u2019m just really, really proud of them. And with that, Tom, over to you. Tom Nealon : Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I'm also very proud of the Southwest team. It's a quarter like we've never had operationally. So congratulations, all you heroes. There's a lot I'm going to cover, so I'm going to get right into it. So, our third quarter revenues as you've all read were down 68% year-over-year, which is actually a pretty decent improvement versus 83% decline we experienced in the second quarter. Passengers declined 65% for the third quarter, and our fares were down roughly 20%. We do expect that yields will continue to be under pressure. But having said that, we've actually seen some pockets of close in sequential yield improvement that began in September, and that has continued into October, which is quite encouraging. In terms of our monthly performance, demand and bookings stalled hard in July with the rising COVID cases. In July, operating revenues were down 71% year-over-year, with a load factor of 43%, and that was on capacity that was down 31%. In August, we saw modest improvements in bookings and close in leisure demand, with operating revenues down 69% year-over-year, and that was on a load factor of 43% with capacity down 27%. The trend improvements continued into September, with operating revenues down 66% year-over-year with load factor of 52%. And that was on capacity that was down 41% as we reduced our schedules to right size our capacity for post-summer demand. And that's certainly helped us to get to the better-end of our guidance range. And Labor Day travel was actually pretty solid, and leisure demand held up well for the remainder of the month, which was great to see certainly relative to July. In terms of the demand environment, what we're seeing continues to be heavily leisure-oriented and bookings continue to trend closer in, mostly inside of 21 days for the third quarter. Now at this point, we're seeing a modest pickup in bookings beyond 21 days, especially for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which is great to see. And seasonality certainly continues to be a key factor for demand. Now, I think as you expect at this point, our business travel continues to be very weak, and our corporate managed travel is down 89% for the quarter, which is consistent with the second quarter, and we expect business travel to remain down significantly through the end of 2020 and well into 2021. I'll talk more about this in just a few minutes. Now in terms of our capacity planning, demand continues to be inconsistent by market, which makes it pretty challenging. Our network planning team is doing a very, very incredible job. And they have the tools, and they have the experience to make capacity and schedule adjustments quickly, and they're doing that quite routinely at this point. However, in the third quarter, we did certainly continue to see strength in areas such as Southern California, Inter-cal, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Texas and Florida. And we're also seeing more signs of life in markets like Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis as well as others. And we're also seeing demand worldwide again come back as the state relaxes its quarantine requirements for travelers that tested negative for COVID and begin to see us add back all Hawaii flying. We'll have all of our California through Hawaii routes restored in November with the exception of Oakland and San Jose to Kona. We're also adding new service to Honolulu from San Diego and for the time being our inter-island service remains status quo. We're also continuing to see relative underperformance in markets with quarantine restrictions such as New York, New England and other states. Short haul markets have also seen less strength and we\u2019ve added more connecting itineraries to compensate for this and we're still maintaining service to all of our markets. We continue to adjust our flight schedules in 30, 60, 90-day increments. At this point, we are in a very, very clean rhythm to do so effectively and efficiently. We are getting pretty good at this. In terms of the third quarter financial impact from blocked middle seats, the impact in July and August was fairly immaterial, but we estimate that September impact was roughly $20 million and that was some spilled revenue that we just weren\u2019t able to accommodate. But similar to what we did in the second quarter, we added nearly 19,000 additional flights as Mike mentioned during the third quarter to capture as much the demand that otherwise would have been spilled. The results were pretty good with over 75% of those flights covering the variable costs and helping to reduce our cash burn. So to close out the third quarter, I just want to hit on our other revenue, which was down 19% year-over-year. And as you might expect ancillary revenues trended almost right in line with the fastest decline that we've experienced, especially for products like Early Bird and Upgraded Boarding. Now, revenue from our Rapid Rewards program was down 43% year-over-year where we're actually continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit card. In fact, revenue from the card spent in the third quarter performed quite well and was down only 12% year-over-year. Obviously cardholder acquisitions were down substantially simply due to fewer customers as well as tightened credit approval rates, but we still added new shareholder cardholders and our attrition rate has held steady. So our overall credit card portfolio continues to perform very well despite some very clear and obvious challenges. Okay. So that's on Q3. Fourth quarter. I would say that we are cautiously optimistic about steady modest improvements in leisure revenue trends going into the holidays. October demand and bookings have held up well compared to September and that's despite the lack of a big holiday weekend in October. We don't have much of October left to book at this point and we expect operating revenues to be down approximately 65% to 70% year-over-year with an estimated load factor of 50% to 55% and with ASMs expected to be down approximately 45% year-over-year. At this point November and Thanksgiving travel is booking pretty nicely. November operating revenues are currently expected to be in a down 60% to 65% range year-over-year with a load factor in the 50% to 55% range and that's with capacity expected to be down roughly 35% year-over-year. So, as you all know Thanksgiving travel dates fall completely in November this year, which gives November operating revenues a three to four point head start versus last year due to the calendar shift. We have less visibility into December but at this point we're seeing a nice early trend in holiday demand. And I'd say at this point in the booking curve, our book load factor for the Christmas holiday period is roughly in line with prior years, but of course that\u2019s on much lower capacity. So we can\u2019t extrapolate that for the full month, but hopefully virus case counts will stay under control and that gives you a sense of the type of leisure demand that we're seeing for holiday peak travel periods. We also expect a more significant negative financial impact from blacked middle seats in October, November as demand continues to improve. So for October, we're estimating a $20 million impact to pre-tax results and a $40 million to $60 million impact to November. So our ability to add flights during the Thanksgiving travel period is pretty limited. So we're not able to capture the customer demand that we're seeing in our markets. So we're spilling that revenue opportunity. As you see from our most recent schedules, we\u2019ve adjusted our December schedule to better match capacity to demand and we're expecting December ASMs to decrease 40% to 45% year-over-year. So in total fourth quarter ASMs are expected to be down roughly 40% year-over-year. So we are not ready to provide a lot of color on December at this point, but we will provide an 8-K investor update sometime mid-November. I do want to share a few thoughts on corporate travel. First off, we achieved yet another milestone recently with the launch of the Amadeus GDS platform, which is the last of our four new GDS platforms. So Southwest fares are now available on Apollo, Galileo, Worldspan, and now Amadeus. And I will tell you that throughout the entire pandemic this entire experience, our corporate sales team hasn't slowed down a bit. In fact, they've been extremely active working with corporate customers and the travel management companies and without a doubt, I can tell you, there is a lot of energy and there is a lot of excitement about having Southwest fares available on the GDS channel. So as it stands today, the vast majority of our corporate accounts continue to have travel restrictions in place and they are telling us that they expect a modest return travel over the next six months. But having said that, I can't tell you that we're seeing over 90% of our large corporate accounts traveling today, although on a dramatically reduced level, but they are beginning to travel. We're also beginning to see the corporate booking curve flatten out a bit which signals to us that customers are gradually becoming more confident in booking future travel. Now we don't have a crystal ball and you have the same data that we have, but our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly. And perhaps by the end of 2021, our assessment is that domestic business could be in the range of down 50% to 60%. Now whether or not business travel returns to 2019 levels in the next two or three years is anyone's guess. And there are a lot of opinions on this. But there could very well be a 10% to 20% structural reduction in business travel coming out of COVID that could take several, several years to rebuild. But I got to tell you from a Southwest standpoint, there is still a lot of upside for us since we're competing in a channel where we've never competed before. The Southwest experience -- I'm sorry, the customer experience at Southwest is firing on all cylinders and the Southwest Promise is a very big part of that. And our customers are continuing to share very, very positive feedback about their travel experience. And Mike mentioned this, but we continue to have the highest brand Net Promoter Score in the industry. But addition to that, we are significantly outpacing the entire industry when it comes to the DOT customer satisfaction rankings. So in the last month report published by DOT, we were best in the industry with the ratio of 3.97 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded. Now just to put that into context and perspective, our closest competitor was almost twice that and the closest network carrier had a ratio of almost six times more complaints than we did. And just as it's always been that\u2019s because of our people, that's because of our hospitality, that's because of our culture, that\u2019s because of the quality of the operation, but that's who we are. So, I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the Southwest Promise because I think it's a really important and a really timely topic. So, as you know we require face coverings and a health declaration before traveling. We have extensive cleaning in airports with physical distancing at the gates, as well as a physically distance boarding process. Every aircraft is equipped with an air distribution system to introduce this fresh outdoor air and HEPA filtered air into the cabin while in flight. And what all that means that the air in the cabins being exchanged every two to three months and HEPA filters remove 99.97% of airborne particles and that's similar to what you find in hospital operating rooms. Our enhanced overnight aircraft cleaning requires six to seven hours of labor each night on every plane in our fleet. We are applying an electrostatic disinfectant and antimicrobial spray on every surface as been certified to last 90 days, but we're applying it every 30 days, or three times what's required. We clean the lavatories and tray tables of every aircraft before every flight and we are blocking middle seats through November 30. So that's the Southwest Promise. And we just know a lot more today than we did seven months ago. And now we're seeing all the medical, the scientific research and it is very clear that the aircraft environment is one of the safest indoor environments anywhere in the world. When you think about what we do every day, whether it's shopping, going on TV live sporting events, there really is no other environments we're going to find the conditions and all the precautions you're going to find out in an airplane. Gary talked about our partnerships with UT Southwestern and Stanford University School of Medicine. Both of these organizations are serving as expert resources to us to help us shape our policies so we continue to deliver our Southwest Promise going forward. The latest bolt-on by Harvard School of Public Health conclude that wearing facemasks as part of a multi-layer approach offers significant protection. We also have new research from the Department of Defense on how airflow systems combined with HIPAA filters effectively make the risk of contracting COVID-19 aircraft extremely, extremely low even if every seat is occupied. So the science on the issue is pretty clear at this point. And with the data and knowledge that we now have, we feel very confident make the decision to begin selling all available seats beginning December 1. But I do want to be really clear, we would not have made this decision, well, without the overwhelming data that makes clear that this does not put our employees or our customers at risk. We couldn't possibly do that with a clear conscience, and we wouldn't do that. But we do have confidence in our decision based on all the medical expertise, studies, research and partnerships that are in place that this is safe and this is the right approach going forward. So tomorrow we will begin communicating with every customer who has booked a flight beyond November 30. And if a customer's uncomfortable with us selling all seats and wants to cancel their flight, we will give them a full refund, no questions asked. And we'll have this option in place throughout the month. We'll also notify customers at least several days before their flight if the flight is booked beyond 65%. If they choose to change their flight, we'll do our best to re-accommodate them as well. This is what we do. So the Southwest Promise is real, and it's a commitment we made. And it's important to us. It's important to our customers, and it's important to our employees. So we're going to continue to be proactive and transparent in communicating with our customers, and we're going to keep taking great care them. So lastly, I just wanted to talk about our recent announcements of new additions to our route map. Gary alluded to them, and you've read about them. These new airports aren't recent thoughts, and they certainly aren't reactive thoughts to the current environment. In fact, they\u2019ve been on our list of commercial opportunities for years. But as you all know, with the retirement of the 737 classic fleets and the grounding of the MAX aircraft, we've been in an aircraft deficit position for the past several years now. At this point, with COVID, we're actually in an aircraft surplus position, and now we're able to put idle aircraft and our people to work, while at the same time strengthening existing markets in our network that are already very, very strong, markets like South Florida, California, Denver, Chicago and Houston. These are markets where we have a significant presence, and these are cornerstones of our network, and these additions only make them stronger still. So here's a recap of what we've announced. Year round service to Miami and Palm Springs begins November 15. These are leisure-oriented markets that strengthen our successful operations in Southern Florida and California. Seasonal service to Hayden, Colorado and Montrose, Colorado begins December 19. These are markets that expand on our successful Denver operation and provide really strong seasonal revenue opportunities when we typically have idle aircraft time. And in the first half of 2021, we'll add service to Chicago O'Hare and Bush Intercontinental. And this allows us to reinforce our commitment to these cities and markets, similar to how we operate in the LA Basin, Oakland and San Francisco, the Boston area and in DC and Baltimore. As part of our earnings release today, we've also announced our intent to begin serving Colorado Springs, Colorado, Savannah, Georgia and Jackson, Mississippi, all slated to begin service in the first half of 2021. And all these new airports are great opportunities for Southwest, and we have a long list of others that we intend to tackle as it makes sense and each of these new airports are natural extensions that plug in really well to our existing network. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the financials. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Tom, and, hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. Before I begin though, I'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of our Southwest warriors. You all are performing magnificently, despite the challenges of this pandemic. The $1.2 billion net loss we reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis this morning certainly speaks to the staggering impact the pandemic has had on air travel demand and our business. Our GAAP results included two large special items, payroll support program proceeds of $1.2 billion, which was mostly offset by $1.1 billion in charges for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off program as well as our normal fuel hedge special item. Speaking of our voluntary programs, I'd also like to thank our more than 15,200 employees who participated in these important programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. It has been emotional to see so many of our Southwest family members depart, and we are very, very grateful for their dedication and service to our incredible company. We are determined to make them proud and are focused on emerging from this pandemic as stronger than ever. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees in these two programs combined. And in addition to helping us cut our costs, the extended leave program gives us a lot of flexibility should the business recover faster and we determine we need to recall employees. We had more than 4,200 employees elect the voluntary separation program. Our September 30 headcount of nearly 58,000 full-time equivalent employees is down nearly 3,200 compared with June 30, which illustrates about 75% of voluntary leave participants left the Company during third quarter. Virtually all of the remaining employees have separation dates by year-end. The total cost of these two voluntary programs could be up to approximately $1.7 billion, if none of the pilots on extended time-off are recalled before the end of those that selected a five-year election period. The NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds to $2 billion, if there are no employees recalled early from the extended emergency time-off program. In terms of the accounting, we have now accrued approximately $1.4 billion in 2020 of the $1.7 billion potential cost of these programs, which includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off, at least through February of 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. We accrued approximately $300 million in second quarter and $1.1 billion in third quarter, which are reflected as special items in our non-GAAP results in both quarters. The remaining $300 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time-off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time-off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will closely monitor the demand environment and record further accruals, if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $195 million in third quarter, leaving our accrued program costs at about $1.2 billion. We expect our cash payments to be approximately $300 million in fourth quarter, about $500 million in 2021, and up to approximately $700 million in 2022 and beyond. In terms of the cost savings from these programs, we expect salaries, wages and benefit cost savings of approximately $550 million in second half 2020, $143 million realized in the third quarter, and over $400 million in fourth quarter. For 2021, we expect a $500 million in incremental savings over 2020 for approximately $1.1 billion in total savings next year or over $90 million per month. We expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. And savings for the voluntary extended emergency time-off program could be up to almost $600 million in total for 2022 through 2025, if no employees are recalled from the extended emergency time-off program. So, the savings opportunity and flexibility the programs provide are substantial. We also recently shared that we are seeking the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction across all work groups in 2021, which would represent cost savings of at least $500 million beginning next year. These cost savings are crucial, especially in our largest cost category as we aim to preserve jobs, while achieving necessary and meaningful cost efficiencies in this suppressed capacity environment, so that we are better positioned for a healthy and faster recovery. For third quarter, our overall cost performance was strong, as we remain laser focused on managing our cost. Excluding special items, our operating costs decreased 30.1% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and increased only 4.1% year-over-year on a unit basis. Our third quarter capacity was down 33% year-over-year, which resulted in approximately $330 million in reduced cost for our variable, flight-driven, non-fuel expenses and that's primarily in salary, wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We realized further cost savings driven by the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. I already covered the cost savings from our voluntary leave program, which was $143 million in third quarter. By parking aircraft we were able to defer flight hours and maintenance activities and further reduced our maintenance expense, which was included in the $330 million I mentioned previously. We also reduced our third quarter other operating expenses by more than $100 million by cutting advertising spend, technology projects and discretionary spending. Our cost performance continues to benefit from significantly lower energy prices which saved us $257 million in third quarter alone, compared with our expectations for third quarter fuel costs at the beginning of this year. Our third quarter fuel price was $1.23 per gallon, down $0.84 or 41% year-over-year and based on our current fuel hedge and fourth quarter market prices we estimate continued and welcomed fuel price relief year-over-year with that estimated fourth quarter fuel price in $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range compared with $2.09 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year. Our fuel hedging portfolio continues to provide insurance against spikes in jet fuel prices with material upside protection, no floor risk and very manageable fuel hedging premium expense. We have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio and our premium cost per gallon has increased this year simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our third quarter premium expense of $24 million equates to $0.08 per gallon and full year 2020 premium cost remains at $97 million also $0.08 per gallon. For 2021, we expect premium expense to be similar to 2020 based on our current portfolio. Our hedging protection for 2021 is solid with hedging gains that we began at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost relief from lower market fuel prices, our third-quarter fuel efficiency improved 10% year-over-year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. We are also benefiting from lower load factors and better on-time performance and we expect for this trend to continue in fourth quarter and currently estimate our fuel efficiency to be similar to what we realized in third quarter year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items, and prior-year profit sharing, third quarter operating costs were down 17% year-over-year, which was towards the better end of our guidance range and increased 23.4% year-over-year on a unit basis driven primarily by the significant reduction in capacity. Based on current plans for fourth quarter 2020 capacity to decrease approximately 40% year-over-year, fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 20% to 25% year-over-year. This represents a sequential improvement from the third quarter, driven primarily by lower capacity and additional cost savings from our voluntary leave programs. Our swift self-help actions have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with our original plan. Our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing are expected to be down $2.8 billion this year compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity has driven fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We have reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received and the remaining savings are driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these self-help actions, we benefited from the significant drop in fuel prices this year, which we estimate will save us another $1 billion in fuel cost compared with our expectations at the beginning of the year. That brings our total fuel savings compared with plan to more than $2.5 billion and our total cash outlay savings to approximately $9 billion compared with original plans. I am very proud of the Southwest team and their diligence to realize these meaningful cash savings. Our effective tax rate for third quarter was 25%. The CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be carried back five years for a refund of taxes paid beginning in 2015. And as a full cash tax payer for the past five years, we will be able to take advantage of this CARES Act provision without projected 2020 net losses. Further as our corporate tax rate was 35% part of the passage of tax reform in 2017, our 2020 tax rate is trending higher than our year ago rate. This was due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher prior year tax rate that drives the larger tax refund. We currently estimate our annual 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to fleet and CapEx. We continue to be well-positioned with our fleet flexibility over the next several years whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity if the environment supports growth. As a reminder, our interim agreement with Boeing from earlier this year is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. The environment has not improved since then and is certainly safe to say that we do not need 48 aircraft next year at least for growth. We are in the process of restructuring our order book with Boeing and do not have a revised delivery schedule to share with you today. But we do hope to now down the specifics soon. Our 2020 capital spending forecast remains unchanged. We have more than offset the $1.4 to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for this year. We have been successful and aggressively managing our capital spending throughout this pandemic and our goal is to do the same in 2021. While we are not prepared to provide 2021 CapEx guidance today, it's our full intention to keep 2020 CapEx to a minimum and low level, including any revision to our order book. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.6 billion and including our fully available $1 billion revolver, liquidity of $15.6 billion. Since our last earnings call, we issued an additional $1 billion of unsecured debt, raised $121 million through an aircraft secured financing and received our full allocation of Payroll Support Program proceeds. We ended the quarter with a total of $10.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet, leaving us in a net cash position of $3.7 billion with leverage of 54%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And this doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. We remain laser-focused on reducing our core cash burn. And for third quarter, our average core cash burn was $16 million per day, which was a sequential improvement from our rate of $23 million per day in the second quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by strengthening close-in leisure demand and booking trends. And based on the strengthening of our fourth quarter revenue trends thus far, coupled with cost savings from our voluntary employee leave programs, we currently estimate core cash burn for October to be approximately $12 million per day and fourth quarter to be approximately $11 million per day. And remember that our core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. During fourth quarter, we expect the most notable working capital change not included in our average daily core cash burn of $11 million to be driven by payments made for our voluntary employee leave program, which will be nearly $300 million. We also anticipate normal seasonal swings in our air traffic liability balance, with an expected seasonal drop-off in bookings later in the quarter due to the post-holiday slower time period, which could cause our cash burn including working capital to be higher than our core cash burn estimate of $11 million per day. Our current cash balance is $13.7 billion, which factors in a $500 million bullet maturity debt payment that we repaid earlier this month. Factoring in all the moving parts I just mentioned, we currently estimate our cash balance to be roughly $13 billion at the end of this year. And finally, we expect to have about 590 million weighted average shares outstanding in fourth quarter, which is an increase of 27 million shares from second quarter due to the May 1 issuance of 80.5 million shares, which was included in the weighted average calculation for only two months in the second quarter. So in closing, we are proud to still have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all three rating agencies. And our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We must see a significant rebound in revenues as we cover today, but our efforts to boost liquidity, add new low-risk pools of revenue and ongoing focus to reduce cost and cash burn provide a solid foundation when they do allow us to rebuild our predominantly domestic network. While we've got ways to go, our people have the grit, resolve and determination to carry us through this pandemic. And with any luck, the worst is hopefully behind us. So with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Operator : Certainly, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. The question \u2013 I'm curious, could you comment on the moves, Houston and O\u2019Hare in the context of the aspirations of the corporate travel, and how much those two are interconnected? I understand what you said about having the capacity of planes that you didn\u2019t used to have and now you have a surplus and you put them there. But it does seem like the two are probably more connected than not. Could you just elaborate? Gary Kelly : Yes, I\u2019ll try, and then Tom will chime in. We've been thinking about Houston for quite some time. Houston is sort of a sprawling Metroplex. And Hobby serves Houston well, but it doesn't serve the North part of Houston which is where the growth has been over a long period of time, so I made the decision in 2005 to pull out of Bush. We had other priorities at the time and we debated at the time whether or not we were going to be giving up access to a growth region. So, the Company's come a long way in 15 years. We've had a lot of opportunities, done a lot of good things. But I just felt like at some point, we wanted to get back into Houston and rather Bush. And it's our third time. I don\u2019t know if you know our history there, but it was actually the original Houston Airport when the Company started funny enough back in 1971. But it was in our plan for 2021. And it forecast very well. We're going to have a great schedule out of there. Houston, the City of Houston and the airport system are very supportive of Southwest, and they're a delight to work with. So, we\u2019ve got the real estate access. I would contrast that -- so again, it\u2019s a great opportunity. If it\u2019s a leisure oriented world for a while, there\u2019ll be plenty of leisure customers that we'll be able to take to and from and through Houston Intercontinental. O'Hare is different in the sense that we're going to continue to grow back to the Houston example out of Houston Hobby. We'll continue to invest and grow, not right now because of the pandemic, but this will pass. Chicago is very different. We are not able to continue to grow, once the pandemic has passed at Midway. And I'm sure you're familiar with the constraints there. So, I just can't fathom that it's a good strategy for our Company to sit here and say for the next generation we cannot grow in Chicago. So you can kind of go through the mental list of what the options are. And I can assure you that trying to expand Midway is not an option. It is just literally not a feasible option. Certainly, it's nothing that could happen in a short period of time, and it would cost a bloody fortune. So that leaves O'Hare. And O'Hare was real estate restricted, and now it's not. And so, we're there. And I'm very much looking forward to that opportunity. Like Houston, it will also offer access to a section of the metro area that we probably don't serve very well in the north. But I think we'll likely have a similar route system to begin to plug into our strengths, and I think we'll do very well there and it will complement Midway very well. And then, finally, I guess, yes, they're not leisure destinations per se, but there are plenty of consumers that we're getting on our airplanes all over our system. And again, I think pretty much explains why the timing is what it is with O'Hare. If we don't move now, we risk never getting in there. So, we're moving now. Myles Walton : Thanks for the color. Gary Kelly : Yes, sure. Operator : And the next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Just on your views on corporate, of course, nobody knows exactly how this is going to play out. But I think I heard you say you\u2019re planning for it still to be down 50% to 60% by the end of next year. And if that's the case, what are the implications for Southwest restoring profitability? And certainly, appreciate you've managed through long periods of impaired corporate where your earnings snapped back and your revenue snapped back a lot more fast, a lot more quickly than the industry broadly. So just from a Southwest perspective, what are the implications for profitability if that view plays out? Gary Kelly : Well, I didn't give Tom a chance to answer on the last. So I will this time. I'd -- I'll just make one point, Tom, which is we are positioned now in the corporate market to be a real player. And I think as that corporate market begins to recover, we will capture a larger share of that recovering market than our handful of competitors, number one. But number two is what I covered in my overall remarks which is we are low cost, we\u2019re low fare. We are very well suited to serve the consumer. And I have been delighted to see how our yields have been improving here without the business customer. So I wouldn't at all assume that we can\u2019t be successful with a smaller mix of business travelers and the implication on the fares there at all. I think we're perfectly suited to operate in this environment and have -- we've operated in recessionary environments before where business travel was depressed and recovering and performed very nicely. But Tom would -- Tom Nealon : I think you kind of characterized it pretty well. I think that we\u2019ve got a -- I really do feel like we have a great opportunity in the large corporate and managed travel business. I just feel like we\u2019ve been so underindexed there. We're going to get more than our fair share. So I think that\u2019s a big deal, but I think this is part of the reason we're going to have to live longer if you will off of leisure travel. And that's part of the reason we\u2019re looking forward to new revenue pools. That's part of the very strategy we have. And we have some pretty clear criteria for the markets that have been on the whiteboard for a while and that we've chosen Huawei. We\u2019ve already vetted these things financially and operationally. But what they\u2019ve got to do for us is to deliver quickly. So first, they need contribute quickly to reduce cash burn versus longer startup markets, two to three year startup markets. These got to be low startup up costs with quick payback. And they got to strengthen the existing network and got to have more connectivity coming from these other new stations. So, we're trying to find ways to fill in the capacity gaps, if you will. But I think that the corporate market will come back, and we're going to be stronger than you might have seen in the past, but that's why we're doing in the new markets as well I think. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And then, if I could sneak in a follow-up. Can you just remind us on the 48 MAX you were slotted to take and understand that number may change? How many of those 48 are built today? Thanks for taking the questions. Tammy Romo : Yes. There's 34 that are currently built that have not been delivered to Southwest. Operator : The next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator, and thanks very much everybody for taking the time. Just on a follow-up question on the business traffic. What milestones do you think we should watch to see how you're doing in that new segment? I don't mean it from a recovery perspective as much as I mean it for increasing share and seeing what we should look at, so that we know that your -- what you're doing is working I guess. Tom Nealon : Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I'm looking at and what our team is looking at is, we're looking at contracts. We\u2019re looking at contract compliance. So, we're looking at just the sheer number of new business travelers that we're getting. We're looking at the relationships and interactions with our corporate travel partners. And so externally, I'm not sure exactly what you should be looking at, but I know how we're going to run the business. And it is really -- it's a pretty tight way to run the business, but we are really looking at number of engagements, number of interactions, new contracts signed, contract compliance and just year-over-year revenue growth. And by the way, what are we doing to make sure the customer\u2019s really satisfied, so it means any one-off kind of things we need to be doing to satisfy that customer. We're going to do it satisfy them because we intend to take market share. So I'm not sure exactly how I\u2019d look at it if I were you. Certainly, we\u2019ll report on that for you in terms of our business performance versus leisure. But internally, we\u2019ve got a pretty myopic and pretty -- very narrow set of things we're looking at that we're executing against. Gary Kelly : Yes, Helane. I don't know I'm really adding anything. I think we will manage that like you would expect, and then I'll defer to Tammy and Ryan to decide how they want to share the information. But we would want to measure our growth, and we would expect that growth rate to be easily double digit. So we'll set high -- high goals for ourselves, but -- we're \u2013 we are -- the other nice thing about this is these are discrete customers. We know them, and we can monitor the traffic. So it's unlike the so-called business travel segment. We don\u2019t know what people are traveling for unless we ask them. So this is different. This is a subset of corporate travelers. We know them. We know the travel managers, and it's something that is very, very measurable. I don't think we have enough experience right now to set a meaningful goal for a year other than a target. So as we gain some experience here, I think we'll know better whether or how effective our approach is and be able to make adjustments. But the pandemic has messed all that up as we all know. So we'll get our feet under us here, and I think be able to set some realistic goals. And Tammy and Ryan will decide how they want to share all that. Tom Nealon : I do think that just as we do, you will be looking at -- this is GDS data, this is GDS. When you look at [indiscernible] data is like we look at the [indiscernible] and see how we're doing -- picking up share, not picking up share. But Gary's right, it\u2019s growth and we intend to grow. Helane Becker : Okay. That's really helpful. Would you look at signing up or partnering with an international airline at some point as a predominantly domestic airline? Do you think your business travelers would want that or are your business travelers and corporate customers predominantly domestic U.S.? Gary Kelly : Well, I think that at some point, I think we\u2019ve talked about this several times, I think -- I'm sorry, many times. Yes. We think that codeshare partners, airline partners would be a good thing for us both inbound and outbound. Certainly as we start to work with the more international corporate customers, they do a lot of international travel which is really unaddressable by us today. So having a good code share partner would be a good thing. It's not our priority right now, given what's going on with international and given what we\u2019re trying to do with some other priorities. But yes, we would absolutely be a nice thing for us to have in our back pocket if you will. Operator : Next question will be from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hi, everybody. I'd like to continue to steam off the corporate stuff, and Tom and Gary; I want to push you a little bit on a couple of things. Tom, last year I asked you about agency commissions and their roles, and you implied to me that you weren't really interested in paying a lot of commissions to them. But history would suggest that you're going to have an uphill battle with those people unless they're really incentivized to participate. Do you still feel the same way about that knowing now what you know? That's part one. Tom Nealon : Yes, I think, once you get into the GDS world, you're going to be working with TMCs and that's part of what we do. We do want to make sure that we protect our core business and our core channel, which is southwest.com. So you're going to see us be very restrictive in terms of white label agencies that will be allowed to work with us in GDS. But I think if you want to be in that world, Hunter, I think that\u2019s part of the deals. We want to make sure that we're working with the right ones and we're working with the right clients. But, yes, that's not something we intend to turn on to our leisure traveler, if you will. Gary Kelly : And Hunter, it's a very fair question. I think the other thing that we would argue is we've got a great route network, we have great service. We have great policies. There is just more to it, and we have traditionally been as you well know very successful by the customer driving the demand and not the intermediary. So it's a classic, now near 50-year-old Southwest Airlines play. So, we feel like we're in a stronger position than ever to be able to execute well on this, but that\u2019s fair question, and we're kind of just getting started at this. But I agree with Tom, I think that's the right way to do this, and I think we\u2019re going to be very successful. Hunter Keay : And then as a follow-up, I get your point about the customer driving it. But when you think about the ease of use for the TMCs right, if you're not giving these TMCs the ability to know that they've got full content and to know that they're seeing the lowest fare every time, how are you making their life easier if they're still -- during the booking process, they still have to go to your website and check that they're getting the lowest fare. Is there a scenario where TMCs because of partial content are not going to be able to see the full spectrum of fares that are available to them through that GDS channel? Andrew Watterson : Hi, Hunter. It's Andrew. Right now, zero to 13 days, all of our content is in the GDS. The TMCs can access our content through the GDS through our direct connect as well as through [indiscernible] and our competitors also have content which is not in the corporate travel environment. They find them in GDS, but they're blocked in corporate travel. So if the corporate travel wants to access their lowest fare, they also have to go outside the GDS environment to find those basic economy fares, which usually line up with the fares that we don't have in the corporate environment. So I think our content is like for like overall and within zero to 13, it\u2019s 100%. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Gary Kelly : Another good question, Hunter. We had to call in a lifeline on that one. So, thank you. Hunter Keay : I appreciate all the color. Sorry for the -- it's a little out of field. But I appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you. Gary Kelly : No, not all, very good question. Operator : And the next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, you spoke pre-COVID about the desire to have a more economical smaller gauge airplane and talked a little bit about the 220. I'm wondering if the opportunities to gain share as a result of COVID, whether that makes the case for the 220 more compelling. When you think about playing offense and gaining share, how much more of an opportunity would there be, if you had a plane like the 220? Gary Kelly : Well, I'm just reflecting on your pre and post the nature of your question. I don't -- Mike, I don't know that the pandemic in and of itself changes things, except that -- I mean --let's just -- we've shrunk the airline. So -- and Tammy was referring earlier to our Boeing commitment. And we don't know when we're going to grow, and we have a surplus of aircraft. So the only thing that I would willingly admit is that if there were ever a scenario for us to consider making a change in aircraft type, it would be now because we are not desperate to grow the airline and may not be for a long time. That doesn't really address the essence of your question. I think what Mike and Tammy are working on is to make sure that we're comfortable that we're going to have the best 150-ish seed narrow-body airplane in the world in terms of performance, in terms of economics, in terms of fit into our system. And it just makes -- if we have to make a change, it just -- again, I'm just admitting that the environment lends itself to the time that would be required for us to make that kind of an investment. Absent that, Mike, I don't know -- or Tammy, I don't know that there\u2019s anything that\u2019s really different in addressing that question. We've been very forthcoming that we are talking about to Boeing about a variety of things. And obviously, we're talking to them about the 737 MAX 7. That's a component of these -- a major component of these conversations. But Tammy, Mike anything you all would add to that. Mike Van de Ven : Yes, the only thing I would add, Joseph, is in our network, there is definitely a need for what I would say 140, 150-seat airplane versus 175-seat airplane. Today -- at the present time, we're mostly focused on the MAX 8, the 175-seat airplane. And the A220 and the MAX 7, they're the two players in the marketplace. And both of those airplanes have their strengths and their disadvantages. And we're -- we made no -- we've been looking at both airplanes. We will continue that evaluation. We're just not at a point in our network; we don't really need to make those decisions until probably 2025 and beyond time frame. So today, we're just really focused on the MAX, getting the MAX back into service, making sure that we have the right delivery schedule with Boeing. Gary Kelly : Yes, I\u2019ll just emphasize the point that Mike made, which is and this maybe in the essence of your question. We absolutely still need the smaller airplane prospectively. We have a ton of 737-700s that are coming up for retirement over the next five to 10 years. And we will absolutely want to replace them, but we're certainly not thinking that we want all 175 seaters. What I want -- and I hesitate to guess today, but I mean, if you assumed it's half and half, that\u2019s probably as good a guess as anybody's right now about what the future is there, but we'll need a large number of the smaller gauge. Tammy Romo : And the only thing I would just chime in on is, yes, the MAX 7 and the 220 are both fine airplanes. I think both of them certainly serve the mission. And obviously, as always, just the economics of course come into play, and we have long been an all-Boeing carrier. And there are certainly -- there are certainly efficiencies that come with that and -- but all that gets factored into our valuation. But agree that a smaller gauge aircraft like the 220 or MAX 7 certainly are aircraft that we will need to fly those shorter to medium haul markets. But my only point there is, obviously, the economics are a piece of this. And we'll make sure that we have economics that will serve us well and where we can maintain our long low cost position. Joseph DeNardi : That's all very helpful. And then, Gary, you talked about obviously the capacity you have to play offense along with your expectation for a structural reduction in demand over a period of time. I'm wondering if that makes the case for M&A more compelling, all else equal, whether M&A is a means for you all to restore earnings power, restore employment to pre-COVID levels and whether you think the DOJ should change the way they consider further consolidation in the industry. Thank you. Gary Kelly : Well, I think M&A is always on the table. We've participated every 10 years roughly in M&A. And so, I think there's a time and a place for that. Literally today, I think it's a non-starter personally. I mean, all you would do is take on massive losses. And the only restructuring that could be done profitably is to buy and shutdown. And that -- I don't think that that\u2019s feasible or palatable. But -- and I realize we're all -- with your question you\u2019re assuming about well, we're all assuming we\u2019re going to get back to normal here at some point. So I do think it's a very fair question. As to whether or not -- for us as it has been for quite some time, we're not dependent upon an acquisition to grow at all. And I think the number of new markets that we'll be deploying here are evidence of that. And that doesn't even hit the large number of beyond 48 state markets that we were interested in as priorities to these. And we were behind before the pandemic in investing in a lot of our domestic markets quite frankly that we were complaining to each other about. So I think we have ample opportunities for growth under the assumption that things begin to get back to normal. If they don't, then I think your question is much more relevant. But only when you can be comfortable that you are not just buying losses that would sink the Company. So we're just in this uncertain time period where there is just a lot of question marks. On the DOJ aspect of this, there is a failing carrier doctrine that we're all very familiar with, and every airline right now is failing in that sense. So, they're not insolvent because of the massive amounts of debt that's been taken on by the industry, but who knows how all this will play out. Right now, you have far too many seats that are available chasing far too few customers. So all of this has to get corrected. And I don't know, our General Counsel is sitting here, so I don\u2019t -- Mark Shaw, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment. But it seems to me you\u2019ve got all the mechanisms you need to be able to entertain M&A in this environment as it exists today because everybody is in distress. Mark Shaw : I agree, I think it is a matter of getting back to a post-COVID world, seeing where things are. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. And we\u2019ll take our question from Jamie Baker with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey, good afternoon to the team. Gary, if we think about the industry, excluding Southwest post-pandemic cost structures are expected to improve given some level of labor juniorization, fewer aircraft families and so forth. In Southwest's case, you may experience some juniorization yourself, but you obviously won't participate in any fleet rationalization. So the question is, if your ex-fuel CASM advantage relative to your competitors narrows, what sort of influence does that have on how you operate the airline, or are you just completely agnostic about what competitor CASM looks like? Gary Kelly : That's a great question. I don\u2019t think that we -- no, we are not agnostic, absolutely not. We want to use this as an opportunity to widen our cost advantage. And I think it's a little too early to intelligently argue the prospects for that because, as usual, Jamie, you make excellent points. But as we think about late 2021 once capacity -- under an assumption that capacity begins to get back to absorbing our overhead, we're very enthused about the cost environment that we'll find ourselves in at that point. The other thing that I just don't mind sharing is that as we've said several times, we are negotiating with Boeing. And what we want is to have the lowest cost narrow-body operation in the world when it comes to an airplane. So, the other thing that I know you know very well is that all of our, again, you talked about an industry except Southwest. Well, the whole industry has made investments to match a certain size, and that size is now much lower. So by definition, the cost pressure is going to be there. And I think it just remains to be seen whether what you were describing actually turns out to be true, because that's going to be a difficult challenge to have a built an airline for 100, and then to operate at 80 [Phonetic] and to think that you\u2019re going to have a lower cost structure. So we'll just have to see. I think one of the opportunities that -- again, we'll just be blatant about this. This is an opportunity for us to gain share to get back quicker than our competitors to where we were in terms of our operation. And we're, as I said in my opening remarks, we are the best suited for the current environment which is more heavily weighted towards the consumer and leisure travel. We've got tremendous opportunities to add new pools of revenue, which we were not able to attend to before because we didn't have enough airplanes. So now we find ourselves in this opposite position. So yes, the -- well no, we are not agnostic. And hopefully, you can see that we\u2019re behaving in a way that we're trying to make sure that we not just maintain our cost advantage, but we're going to be looking for ways where we can extend it. And the utilization and all of that is key when you have a high fixed cost business as I know you know well. Jamie Baker : And again -- and thank you for that, Gary. And as a quick follow-up, I was just reading something from scoffed before that referred to the proposed 10% pay cut as being arbitrary, and that's fine. I mean they're entitled to the use of that word, but it did make me curious what sort of calculus went into the decision to seek 10% as opposed to some other number and why it's not progressive across the various working groups, not asking you to negotiate in public. Just kind of curious about the genesis behind the 10% ask. Gary Kelly : Well, it is progressive in the sense that we're not asking everyone to contribute the same flat dollar amount. So I think percentages by definition make it progressive in that sense. I know what progressive means, so I get that. But no, it's not arbitrary as Tammy pegged the number at $0.5 billion or more. So it's a meaningful amount of money. Right now, in just very raw numbers, we're roughly 20% over-staffed. Mike, I think that -- or Tammy, I think that number equates to roughly $1 billion a year carrying cost. So I want us to be in a position where we -- back to your previous question, where we can grow or at least grow from here when the time is right. If we downsize the airline, it's much more cumbersome to try to react to that and certainly much less humane to put a bunch of people on the street. So that is the last thing that I want to do, especially at a -- with a legacy that we have in Southwest Airlines that we all care about. But if you -- if you -- there's a cost. First of all, you can't implement a furlough effectively on January 1. So you get some slippage in 2021 in terms of getting a full-year benefit of that. The other thing is there is a cost to implement a furlough both with severance, moving cost, training, all of that is not free. So you kind of do the arithmetic, and if we said, look we need some relief in 2021, we don't need this for two years is the best judgment we've come up with. You can kind of get back to -- I'd take $0.5 billion because you're not going to get $1 billion in 2021 in the first place. So number one. But number two, the logic just says, look, hey we just lost -- we had a record loss. We just lost $1.2 billion. So, the logic that I don't understand which is to say, well if you can only do $0.5 billion, why do it? Well, then you wouldn't do anything with that logic, number one. And then, number two, is well, if you come in and ask for 25% concession or a 50% concession. So you get the point. I think a lot of our logic was, let's try to be reasonable and still empathetic that 10% is a lot to ask for. But it is a lot less than what airlines have traditionally done in terms of the sacrifice that they've asked of their employees. So it's a meaningful amount of money I feel in terms of talking to our investors and our Board of Directors. I feel like it is an effective way to address our overstaffing. And it provides us some optionality to be able to respond when demand comes back. And I think morally, I feel most strongly about this, that every one of the Southwest employees that are here has worked hard to build this Company. They worked hard to serve our customers. And they -- the junior people are our future. And we owe it to them to do everything that we can with the rest of our Company to share this sacrifice and not put the burden on just a few. And I feel very strongly about that. All that has to be negotiated with the union representatives and then -- because these are contract changes, and in fact they have to be ratified by our employees. So we have a long way to go before we can arrive at that. Now that's an explanation on what we've asked for. My focus is on getting the payroll support extended. That is Plan A. And that solves all these issues. And I'm optimistic that still could happen. And if it does, we will terminate all of these requests. And I think it puts us in a very good position where we don't have to ask any of our people for a pay cut much less seek a furlough. Jamie Baker : Gary, thank you very much for these answers. I appreciate it. Take care and good luck. Gary Kelly : Okay. Well, thank you for all the great questions. I appreciate everybody joining us today. That's the end of the analyst portion of our call and have a nice afternoon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda? Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. I'd like to welcome the members of the media to our call today. And I think we can go ahead and get started. So Chad, would you give them the instructions on how to queue up? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Kyle Arnold : Hey, Gary. Hey, guys. I appreciate the time. I'm going to kind of start where you left off a little bit. Both the flight attendants and the pilots unions have been skeptical and bristled a little bit at the idea of pay cuts. How likely do you think you are to get a deal before your deadline? And are there other options that could be on the table outside of that 10% reduction in pay? Gary Kelly : Well, yes, Kyle, I wouldn't want to speculate on odds here. Obviously, I'm hopeful that we can get what we need to protect our people's jobs. This is an overstaffing challenge. It is huge. We have locations that have twice as many people as they need as an example. So -- and this is a problem that could persist for a long period of time, and it just carries a high cost. Our union reps have a duty to represent. The Company has a duty here to, first of all, maintain the financial health of Southwest Airlines or it puts every job in peril. So we've got a long way to go. I'm obviously hopeful that we can arrive at something quickly, and the speed is necessary because we're losing money every day. And there's just no time to waste here. What would be best, of course, is for Congress to act, and that way we could stop all of this and focus on operating a great airline here. But in any event, we're going to continue to -- we've had great dialog with our Unions, and they're almost all engaged. I\u2019m very grateful for that, and hopefully we can arrive at what I've asked. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will be from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : I want to talk about the role that testing could play in creating international travel corridors, and just curious kind of how you're seeing testing -- how that might affect domestic travel and state level quarantine requirements, if there's a role for testing in eliminating some of those? And also kind of whether you're expecting any big changes, if we have a new administration come in? Gary Kelly : I do worry about all of that. I think that has very much -- has a dampening effect on air travel, which is probably stating the obvious. Tom or Mike, you guys want a -- I'm a huge proponent of the testing, and it's something that we're very engaged with. Tom Nealon : Yes. Sure. I think at this point, I think it's a smaller issue for us today than it is for the international network carriers. But having said that, I think that it can become an issue for Southwest as well as domestic travel and travel restrictions could in fact become a bigger deal. In fact today, there is already -- I'm not sure, eight, nine states and cities that have restrictions. So, it's becoming a bigger deal for us as well. Hawaii by far is the most prolific of those. We have a testing and solution in place to handle our customers there. But I think what we really need is a more consistent less patch-worky kind of solution. It's really hard for us to be dealing with Massachusetts and New York and Rhode Island and Connecticut, then drop down New Mexico and Illinois. So you got to have some sort of consistency in terms of a testing regimen and protocol. I think that's important. And I think that honestly -- people -- I think customers need to know what they're expected to do, what test they need to take, where are they going it done, how early before they travel, and all that kind of stuff. So there's a whole lot that we need to inform customers who want to make it something achievable. But I think that\u2019s where we are. So this is something that I know that is important for us. I think it's important for the industry. I think that's how I\u2019d answer your question, Alison. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tracy Rucinski : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to -- I'm going to follow up on Alison\u2019s question on testing. Beyond the use of testing as a way to help ease travel restrictions or quarantine. Given reports yesterday about a woman who died on the Spirit flight from Las Vegas to Dallas, who later turned out to have COVID, can testing ensure that people are not getting on airplanes with COVID and how important is that? Gary Kelly : Well, I think it's a layered approach to begin with. And it's a pretty good step forward in determining who is positive and who is not. So -- and I think the only other thing I would throw in to Alison's or just an answer to Alison's question is it's going to take some time to roll out a testing protocol, let's say, but I think it's well worth it. We were not prepared for this pandemic in this country or in the world, and we need to learn from this and be prepared for the next one even if we don't find that we need these testing protocols for this pandemic. But I think there's a risk of another one. So it just defies logic to suggest that it's not a worthwhile effort to identify those people who are sick, so they don't infect others. So I think we definitely need to press forward on this. Tom and Mike are leading the efforts to do this. And it will help with our Hawaii traffic. And as recent as today, I'm having conversations with acquaintances talking about well I'm ready to travel but where I want to go I'd have to quarantine. And Alison also asked about the change in administration. If that happens, we know what the current administration's view is on imposing quarantines. What we wouldn't know is what would a new -- if we have a new administration, what would they require, we just don't know. And so, that would be a concern. And it would certainly blunt the air travel recovery, if you have to contend with quarantines, no question about it. And Tom mentioned the word \"patchwork\", which is the exact image that makes it really difficult as someone in the travel and tourism industry, much less for being a traveler. You just, if you're not really on top of this, you don't know what you\u2019re going to find. So all that needs to be addressed absolutely. Operator : And the next question is from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi, thanks. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions. Tom, I want to ask you first, you mentioned about testing on the routes to Hawaii. Is that something that's in place for Southwest or you're working on to have the testing done at the airports prior to that? And then my second question is a follow-up. I'm sorry, go ahead. Tom Nealon : No, I'm sorry, Mary. Go ahead, finish your question. Mary Schlangenstein : So I was just going to say my second question is to Mike. On the discussion of the A220s, you've talked a lot in the past about that, but you said a decision wouldn't have to be made until 2025. And I'm wondering, did you mean a decision not till 2025 or that 2025 would be when you would like to start getting some of the smaller aircraft? Tom Nealon : So let me jump into the first one, which is how we're handling Hawaii and the at-home that kind of stuff. So the approach we're taking is kind of the three pieces. One is the at-home tests. The second is we are making people aware of what pharmacies from Hawaii are approved. They are approved providers, if you will. And then, the airport in Oakland is actually doing free drive through testing, which is done day before two days before travel kind of thing. This kind of gets back to -- it's going to be interesting to see how many airports do it the same way. And how do people know what's going on? So the first thing that Southwest needs to do is make sure we have all the most current information out on southwest.com that is very clear for travel from U.S. -- from Mainland to Hawaii what you guys do. Our intent is not to get into the testing business. Our intent is to make customers very aware of what the three paths are, whether it's at home. CVS Pharmacy, just as an example, is our partner of record right now with Hawaii. I think Oakland's working with a provider called Color. Is that correct, Andrew? Well, they're working with a provider to provide the on-airport testing. So I think -- I'm kind of forgetting exactly what your question was, but there are three paths for us to be executing our testing with our customers. The big thing is just to make them aware. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. Yes. That answers it. Mike Van de Ven : So, hey, Mary. This is Mike. It's good to talk to you. Yes. So when I was talking about -- we need the airplane on property coming in around that 2025 period. So, obviously, we'd have to make a decision before that. So within the next year or so, we're going to have to narrow in on what we're going to go do there and weigh all the pros and cons. As you know, introducing a second fleet type to Southwest Airlines, if we decided to introduce an A220, it's a big undertaking for us. Not only with pilot training, but with our systems and our maintenance programs. So, yes, so we need to spend the next year or so, really getting into a deep dive on all of those kinds of things and then coming up with the decision. Operator : And the next question comes from David Koenig of The Associated Press. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Okay. I think my question was asked and answered, but I have one other. And I'm a little bit curious; we're seeing a higher number of cases of the virus now in many states. And I wonder whether your fourth quarter planning, how much that takes into account the possibility of rise in cases? Would another surge this fall or winter? Do you have any idea what that might do to your Thanksgiving or Christmas bookings and your fourth quarter plans? Gary Kelly : David, as I said, the bookings so far -- here we are still ways -- still pretty far ways out from Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving and December bookings are actually looking, as I said, modestly optimistic. Things are getting a little better, and that's in spite of the rising cases right now. Every day you're seeing it. What we aren't seeing and Andrew and our revenue management team are looking every day, going back to what did the trend look like in July as an example, when bookings -- prior to this spike, bookings were trending really nicely, cancellations were coming down. And we are going back and looking at what happened in terms of the early warning system if you will, in terms of when we began to see a change, a demand signal change. And we've identified that. We kind of understand what that is. We are not seeing that right now at all with the spike in cases, we are not seeing the same kind of dynamic that we saw back in July and prior to July. And perhaps that's because this is start getting into the mindset of a consumer, perhaps people just aren't as concerned about it at this point, perhaps because you're not seeing as many hospitalizations and deaths, although both are rising right now. I get that. But perhaps people haven't been as concerned about it as they were in the past. Whatever the reason is, what we're seeing in terms of our demand and cancellations is not reflective of an increase in cases that we might have seen in July, as an example. Operator : Okay. The next question is from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. Dave just asked my first question about the link between coronavirus cases. So my other question is, is there -- regarding your switch in your selling middle seats beginning December 1, do you see any scenario under which you guys would reverse that decision, and also did you do any kind of consumer research or surveys before making this decision? Thank you. Tom Nealon : Hey, Dawn, this is Tom. Well, I guess the first thing is I would never say never. Certainly, our intent is not to reverse the policy decision. And there's a lot of ample evidence for that, good scientific data for that. So I don't think we certainly don't intend to do that. I guess, just give me the rest of your question again; I had a -- customer -- Gary Kelly : Customer research. Tom Nealon : Customer research. Yes. So we do customer research I'd say every week, whether it's online or chats and that kind of thing. And our customers totally get the fact that you guys are a business and you cannot survive and make money if you're only selling two-thirds of your inventory. So they don't expect us to do this forever. What they want to understand is our rationale for making the change. And the rationale is the data. And so, we have to communicate that. We're not going to be marketing all of this, but we need to communicate the rationalization for why we are doing this to our customers, and our customers tend to get it. I mean they really do. But I guess -- the answer to your question is, I can't imagine us reversing course based on everything we know, and we have talked to our customers. And we're trying to be as generous as possible in terms of extending, you want a refund, you get a refund. So, we're being very generous there. So we\u2019re going to manage our way through it, and we'll begin communicating pretty aggressively tomorrow with our passengers. Gary Kelly : I can't -- like Tom, I can't see a scenario where we\u2019re going to change our mind. And Dawn, I mean we're one of five -- I thought it was four, but I was corrected earlier today. We're one of five airlines in the world who are doing this. So there is more than ample evidence that a change is the right thing to do based on all the science that we've got available to us now. And the Department of Defense is very compelling, and they are not biased. They're not -- there is nothing self-serving about it. They want to make sure it was safe for them to move their troops around. And their conclusions I felt were very, very compelling, in addition to all the work that we've had that we've been engaged with -- with various -- Tom Nealon : Just to be clear the middle seat -- the open middle seat, it was really not one of our safety components or safety elements of the Southwest Promise. It was all about customer confidence and comfort. The safety piece of the Southwest Promise was the cleaning and all of the masking, all the things we just talked about. So this was really about customer confidence and getting them comfortable traveling again. Honestly, if you were to ask my family, you want us to pull middle seat back, they'd say, I like having it open because I get more room. But we understand that you can't do that. And I think that if you're just waiting for customer sentiment to be positive, it's going to be hard to get that because people actually like it, so -- Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for just one more question. And that question comes from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Please go ahead. Robert Silk : Thank you. Thank you all for taking my call. You announced a couple of new ski routes -- ski destination routes. I'm wondering, overall, how does your total number of routes to ski towns and ski destinations this winter back up against last and also just capacity to those areas? And what is the outlook you're seeing on bookings for these ski areas considering that the ski resorts themselves are going to have some -- they're making changes and have their own challenges? Gary Kelly : Well, I know we're up at least two. They're brand new for us. Off the top of my head, I don't know what the industry capacity is there. I got to believe that it's probably down, but it's all about snow and sun right now is what I learned from our marketers. Mike Van de Ven : And I think we have a good bit of ski business in Boise and Reno as well as Salt Lake City and Denver. So these two new ski destinations complement a substantial amount of ski business we had in Denver where people were then driving in the mountains. So those are our kind of big ski destinations. Robert Silk : Okay. I guess your move -- so, these are your first two real small-town ski routes, and you\u2019re moving in there as Gary said just because that's snow and sun. Mike Van de Ven : Snow and sun. Robert, years ago we had -- I think we had charter only scenarios to Steamboat out of Dallas I believe. Gary Kelly : I think we had Steamboat, maybe Jackson Hole, and -- but it's been decades since we've done that in a sort of a scheduled chartered basis. But there is enough traffic. It will support a few flights, and we've got a huge presence in Denver, you got it tied into Texas. So, it's all about giving our current customers new options and also all about trying to win some new customers on these routes. And all the research we've done will support this. And right now, the hurdle is not real high because we already have the airplanes, we already have the people. So, we're already paying for that. If we can just get enough customers on board to pay for gas, for the few extra costs, we're ahead of the game. And that's not a long-term viable business strategy, I will add tongue in cheek, but for the time being, it will work really well, and we are planning to have these in our system for many, many, many, many years. So -- Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thanks, Chad, and thank you all for being with us today. If you have any follow-up questions, our Communications Group is standing by (214) 792-4847 or online at swamedia.com. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. The conference is now included. Thanks for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Annual 2020 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Chad and I appreciate everyone joining us for our call today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. First, you will hear a comprehensive update from our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven; our President, Tom Nealon; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. A few reminders. We will make forward-looking statements today which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And we also had several special items in our fourth quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks. And we have more information in our press release this morning regarding forward-looking statements, non-GAAP reconciliations to GAAP results, and other important risk factors. You can find our release and other helpful resources on our Investor Relations website. So, let's get started and I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 call. We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19 and we recognized our first annual loss since 1972. It was a big one and with non-GAAP losses coming in at $3.5 billion. But having said that, we were and remain very well-prepared to weather this continuing storm and especially, important is that we want to emerge on top in the airline industry. We have the strongest liquidity. We have $14.3 billion including $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include our frequent flyer program. We have the strongest balance sheet and pre-pandemic debt to total capital was a company record low at 24%. We have investment-grade credit ratings, and we have cash well in excess of our outstanding debt. Third, we have the best business model. We have an unprecedented run of 47 years of profitability and that was built on low cost and low fares and coupled with great service. And that in turn has resulted in unprecedented job security especially unprecedented for an airline going on 50 years without a furlough, without a pay cut, and the only major airline to avoid all of that during this pandemic. And I'm very, very proud of that. We have the best operation. And as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of airline performances it was released this week was Southwest as number one. And finally, we have the best customer service and I base that on numerous brand surveys and my expectation that once again we will be at the top of the industry in terms of the United States DOT Customer Satisfaction Index of Fewest Customer Complaints. Now, no one can deny that that is a powerhouse combination of attributes for any company. And it just reminded me as I was recapping that I was listening to Herb, many years ago he pointed out that most companies never achieve the best designation in a single category much less five. And I mentioned these things really not to brag, but just to put things in perspective. And that is to say that yes, these are bad times. Yes, we had our first loss since our start-up year. But we have much to be grateful for and we have every reason to be hopeful that this too shall pass and when it does we will be ready. And speaking of being ready, I mean a surge -- a resurgence in traffic and revenues. So we want to be ready for that. And we have to have that to achieve breakeven and then beyond that prosperity. So, there's a balancing act here and we're balancing a desire to conserve cash and minimize our losses, which requires that we operate at a reduced schedule as compared to the need and the ability to achieve breakeven by generating more traffic and we can only do that by offering more flights. So getting that balance is key and we're intensely focused on that.  And I'll just add that we've got the talent, we've got the experience and we have the tools that we need to execute and execute that well. Once we get past this January, February winter doldrum, we'll see what happens and we'll respond accordingly. So we've got excellent updates prepared this morning for you from Mike Van de Ven, our COO; Tom Nealon our President; and Tammy Romo, our CFO. So I don't want to steal any of their thunder except to say one more thing. I mentioned before that we have a lot to be grateful for. And we do and especially at Southwest. And I mentioned gratitude last time in our third quarter call, but I think it's important to repeat it again. I am especially grateful for our people, their resolve, their resilience, their civility and their love. They've gotten us to this point. They will get us through this. They have performed superbly. And I know that everybody in this room with me could -- would join me and say how proud we are of them and we all just want to thank them profusely. They are heroes. So some of these heroes are sitting here with me.  And Mike, I want to congratulate you on a magnificent operational performance. So why don't you kick us off this morning, Mr. Mike Van de Ven, COO. Mike Van de Ven : Well, thanks, Gary and I'd be happy to. As Gary was mentioning in terms of our operation, the fourth quarter was exceptional. We built significant momentum throughout the quarter. The MAX was approved to return to service. We received much needed government support and that allowed us to pivot away from those time-consuming discussions about furloughs and concessions and job security. We were able to grow our city portfolio and the vaccines rollout began. And beneath all of those things, Southwest produced our overall best quarterly operational performance in our history.  And as Gary mentioned, I too have just -- I'm very proud and very grateful to our people. There's tremendous activity associated with all those items I just mentioned. And in addition to those things though our people still go to work every day and they deal with day-to-day issues of a pandemic environment and yet they never lose their focus on our customers, on our company or each other. And they are just a great team.  So for the fourth quarter, our on-time performance of 93% was industry-leading and the best in our history. We finished the year at 86% and that was the best since 2003. Our baggage handling was equally as impressive with just over two bags per 1000 carried being damaged or mishandled. So if you flip that around that's about a 99.8% accuracy rate. And again, the best in our history and in the top tier in the industry. That reliability coupled with our hospitality produced Net Promoter Scores in the mid-70s for the fourth quarter and for the year. So again, the best performance in our history.  And we do expect to lead the industry once more with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio when those are published. So to cap it all off, we finished 2020 with the best overall operational performance of any U.S. airline as measured by the Wall Street Journal's Middle Seat Scorecard. So as I've said before just a great team.  Our fleet has been a particular focus as of late. We now have a combination of additional aircraft available to us from the MAX return to service as well as a lower demand environment from this pandemic. And that gives our tech, ops department several options to optimize our maintenance costs by storing some of our older aircraft and replacing any necessary flying with our most efficient aircraft the MAX. The MAX is more reliable. It has a lower fuel burn. It's quieter. It's less expensive to maintain and it's our most comfortable aircraft from a customer perspective. And it is a key component of our future. So we took delivery of seven leased MAX from Boeing in December. And if you combine that with the 34 MAX we had in storage in Victorville that brought our MAX fleet to 41 aircraft by year-end.  We also identified 20 of our older 737-700s that had an expensive near-term maintenance profile and we accelerated their retirement at the year-end and that brought our fleet total down to 718 aircraft for use in the operation as we go into 2021.  There are 60 NGs included in that year-end fleet count in a long-term storage program. And so the rest of the airplanes, they rotate through our operation and our short-term parking program or they're in heavy maintenance visits. And that approach gives us tremendous near-term flexibility to either slow down or accelerate flight activity as demand dictates. So March 11 is when the MAX returns to revenue flying. All of our pilots will have been trained. We will have had over 200 validation or readiness flight tests completed. And we'll be starting out in a very small and focused manner for the first month with just 10 lines of flying. They'll be isolated to all MAX lines. We will not co-mingle the NG and the MAX fleet for that first month of service. After that we'll have roughly 65 MAX aircraft available for service and we expect to be in normal operational mode by mid-April. We'll end 2021 with 69 MAX aircraft. In closing with the fleet, we plan on running similar retirement analysis to optimize maintenance costs in 2021 just like we did in 2020. And we don't expect our fleet to grow in 2021 as compared to the 747 aircraft at year-end 2019. We do continue to evaluate our longer-term fleet needs and we are in discussions with Boeing as to our order book beyond 2021. As we do start this New Year, we do have our eye on a couple of other critical operational areas. First, we are initiating operations in eight new locations by June 6. There's quite a bit of coordination and facility build-out staffing equipage and security-related actions that go into opening up a new location. And Gary I think eight between now and early June is another all-time Southwest record. And that is a very impressive team. Second, we are in a very reactive environment with respect to COVID restrictions. There are new international requirements with testing and attestation protocols. They are evolving domestic requirements and there are various mask-related challenges that our teams are reacting to every day. So it does take a special team to be able to deliver record-breaking operating results, managing a complicated fleet environment, bringing the MAX back into service and optimizing retirements of older airplanes to open up eight new locations in four months and just to adjust on the fly to constantly changing COVID requirements. And I think about our people and they make all of that look so easy and they do it every day. And as I said they're just a special team and I'm really proud to be a part of it. And I think with that Tom, I'll turn it over to you. Tom Nealon : Okay. Very good, Mike. Thank you. Well, good morning, everybody. And I also really want to start by thanking all of our frontline employees. What a year, what a result and really proud of what we've accomplished with the team. In prior calls, I've always made a point of recognizing our commercial teams our network planning, revenue management, the marketing folks, Southwest business, the customer relations team and they deserve that again. I mean what they're doing is absolutely incredible. But I also do want to recognize a few teams. They are always in that ground that if they aren't there nothing else happens. Our technology teams, our finance teams, our strategy teams and so many others. So they've done incredible work over the past year, honestly that I cannot even imagine or envision. So thanks so much for what you're doing. So I do want to provide a quick recap of our fourth quarter revenue performance. And then I'll cover our near-term trends and guidance for the first quarter. So our fourth quarter operating revenue was down 65% year-over-year, which is a modest sequential improvement compared with the 68% decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Fourth quarter passengers declined 64% year-over-year and our average fares were down 14%, which is a favorable comp to fares being down 20% in the third quarter. We did see some pockets of sequential yield in premium which was encouraging. Our fourth quarter load factor was 54%, which was up from 45% in the third quarter. And this was driven, primarily by a boost in the December load factor at 60%. And as you all know you look at our CCAP on December 1. And this is all on fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year. Just a few monthly performance highlights if you will. October leisure demand and bookings held up well compared to September and that's despite September benefiting from Labor Day holiday travel. October operating revenues were down 64% with a load factor of 55%, capacity down 44%, as all on a year-over-year basis. So given the environment that was a pretty encouraging result for October. November though, we did begin to see a slowing of revenue trends. We expected to see that that will coincide with the presidential elections, but we never got back on to our pre-election trends, which in hindsight I suppose is surprising given that COVID cases and hospitalizations are on the rise, along with new quarantine requirements, travel restrictions, government orders, et cetera, et cetera, and all these are the primary drivers of the softness in demand. And coincidentally, we also saw an increase in trip cancellations in the weeks we have for Thanksgiving. Relative to the rest of the month, leisure demand was more resilient to the Thanksgiving travel period even with the worsening pandemic background. The November operating revenues benefited one to two points year-over-year due to the holiday timing shift from 2019. So November finished with operating revenues down 63%, with a load factor of 48% and capacity down 35%. Again, all on a year-over-year comp basis. December had many of the same challenges we saw in November, with a continued surge in COVID cases, a softness in leisure passenger demand and bookings and elevated trip cancellations. And similar to Thanksgiving, leisure demand for December holiday travel outpaced non-holiday time periods. In December, leisure revenue trends were supported by some pockets of strength. Operating revenues for December were down 67% year-over-year with a load factor of 60%, both of which were in line with our guidance and that was on capacity that was down 43% year-over-year. And just as a reminder, the holiday shift in 2019 had a negative impact of six to seven points year-over-year for December. Let's see regarding middle seats, we estimate an operating income penalty of $30 million in October and a $10 million penalty in November. So, really no surprise there. And as you know and as referenced, we opened up all seats for availability beginning December 1. So for December, we estimate a revenue boost of around $80 million as a result of selling all seats. Our December load factor was up 12 points versus November, and our yields were down month-over-month. But if you adjust for the year-over-year calendar impact of holidays December's year-over-year revenues improved four points sequentially as compared to November. And again, this was very much in line with what we were expecting. In terms of the demand environment, it clearly continues to be heavily leisure oriented. Business demand continues to be very weak and our corporate managed travel was down 87% in the fourth quarter, which was actually a slight improvement in the third quarter, but we have no real movement to speak of. And we expect business travel to be down -- to remain down significantly this year. I don't think that's surprising to anybody. As you know, January and February are typically heavy business travel months, but the absence of business travel is making a weaker leisure travel period even more challenging, and I'll talk about that in just a few minutes here. I do want to hit on very quickly a few highlights of our other revenue, which was down 18% year-over-year, which is obviously much less than the decline we experienced in passenger revenues. And as you expect for products like early bird and upgraded boarding revenue has trended almost right in line with the passenger decline that we're seeing. However, we've seen a much stronger revenue performance for our Rapid Rewards program. Revenue from our Rapid Rewards program is down 38% year-over-year, which again is a solid improvement from the decrease of 43% in the third quarter. And aside from that for card redemptions rather for travel, our loyalty program continues to perform very, very well. Our credit card portfolio is a real point of strength for us, I think, a differentiator and we're continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit cards, which reinforces what I've said many times, which is that our cards really are top of the wallet for customers for everyday purchases as well as for air travel. In fact revenue from card spend in the fourth quarter performed well, and was down only 11% year-over-year. We're also continuing to acquire new Rapid Rewards members and new cardholders, although at a slower rate simply because there are fewer people traveling. So in spite of the environment the size of our program is essentially unchanged, which I think is a pretty powerful statement given the environment. You may have seen we recently provided all Rapid Rewards members with a boost. They're qualifying points towards A-List to A-List Preferred and Companion Pass status. And these as you know are very -- most valued customers and we value them tremendously and they value us, and they certainly value their tier status. So to close out Q4, I just -- I do want to hit a few things that Gary and Mike referenced and that's our brand NPS score as well as our DOT customer sat rankings. Both were the best scores in the industry and we are very proud of that. But I will tell you that we don't take it for granted. We worked really hard to get those results, and our people worked really hard to get those results. Specifically to the DOT customer sat score, we had a ratio of 2.91 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded, which is far, far ahead of our competition. And it's just an incredible result. And again it comes down to our people to our hospitality and to our customer service to our culture and what we believe in. So I just want to say thanks to our folks for that. So that's it for the fourth quarter. We'll move into the Q1. Well, at this point we are nearly done with January and demand has remained as you keep seeing stalled. We expect January operating revenues to decrease 65% to 70% with a load factor of 50% to 55% with ASMs being down 41%. And again that's all on a year-over-year basis. And this compares slightly favourably to our mid-December guidance ranges for both revenue and load factor. And January demand has held pretty steady over the past month or so. And I think in this environment steady honestly isn't so bad. So I'll take that right now. In February, we expect a fairly similar revenue performance in January, but January did benefit from stronger holiday return travel during the first week of the month. We really don't see a real catalyst for February demand at this point. And as you know this is historically a low month for leisure travel. And the business travel that normally filled the demand simply isn't showing up. We currently expect February operating revenues to decrease 65% to 75% year-over-year with a load factor of 50% to 55% and capacity at 46% year-over-year -- down 46% year-over-year. And at this point we aren't providing March revenue guidance, but we'll be certainly providing an 8-K in mid-February and we'll cover all that. But I did think it's worth sharing a few thoughts about what we're seeing beyond February at this point in time. So it is still pretty early in our booking curve for March and April, but relative to January and February we are seeing a slight uptick in bookings for both months. We're behind in the booking curve. We've said that previously versus where we'd normally be. But given the situation, I don't think that's a surprise. I think that's to be expected. You likely saw that we've had more promotional activity than usual including a recent air sale that included the March and April travel period. That's unusual for us. In fact we're talking about this the other day and I don't think any of us could recall doing a wild sale in January. But that's where we are and the goal is simple, we need to stimulate travel. We need to get more bookings in place. And I'd say the sales performed pretty much in line with our expectations. But for now we're not seeing a material boost in bookings for March. But having said that, we are continuing to build load factors every week and the booking curve continues to be skewed close in, so we do expect bookings to continue to fill in. What's not clear though is to what degree. We could be surprised to the upside but at this point there's no real clear revenues on that quite yet. We've shared this with you all before, but once we get back to operating revenues they're roughly 60% to 70% of what they were in 2019, we should be at cash breakeven. But until we get to that point, we'll continue focusing on managing our capacity, our inventory, our pricing, our costs, our operations. Those things that we control we will manage and control well. In terms of regional trends, beach and nature inspired destinations continue to outperform. We're seeing strength in Florida throughout Texas, Colorado, Arizona. California and Hawaii both began the fourth quarter with encouraging momentum. The quarantine and stay-at-home orders will reverse some of that. Some of our larger markets in the Northeast, Midwest like New York and Chicago are underperforming. So I'm not trying to give you an exhaustive list but it does give you some perspective of what we're seeing. As you know the international testing requirements Mike alluded to this took effect on Tuesday. Our teams are ready to go and we really have very few if any operational issues. We did see international cancellations increase a bit just prior to the new requirements go into effect. But we're actually continuing to slowly build load factors for March and beyond. So we're keeping a close eye on all of that but the loads keep managing accordingly. In terms of our flight schedules, we're in the process of making more scheduled adjustments to March to better match capacity to current booking trends. Our outlook for Q1 capacity, I characterize as remaining cautious and we're expecting first quarter ASM to decrease around 35% year-over-year. Just real quick, I do want to give a quick update on our new markets. As you know over the past several months we've announced 12 new airports with four of these airports up and running and eight more coming online over the coming months. We've outlined all this in the earnings release, so I'm not going to repeat it all here. But I will say that I think this is the bread and butter of Southwest Group. The question of why now is very, very easy to answer. First, we have the aircraft we have the people that do it. And second, we're going after new revenue pools. And the airports that we're adding fit into our network very cleanly and they leverage our strong Southwest customer base in very strong Southwest markets. When you think about the new markets such as Bush Intercontinental in Houston Chicago O'Hare, Miami these are also very important for business travel, which is very relevant. The response to our new service so far has been very good. Performance Miami, Palm Springs, Montrose, Yampa Valley was strong in the fourth quarter. So we're quite pleased with what we're seeing. Our start-up costs were very modest and new revenue from these airports, even this early on more than cover the incremental cost of bringing airports online and the cost of operating the flights. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to strengthen and mature these new stations and we see the long-term outlook as being very, very strong very positive. In the near term though just like the rest of the system there's always demand risk. But again, we're very pleased with early signs to these new markets and cities. One last thing. I just want to quickly cover where we are with our corporate travel work, as I reported last quarter. Right now, we are live with four GDS platforms Amadeus and Travelport's Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan platforms. I'm also very pleased and happy that we're able to reach an agreement with Sabre at the end of last year. Our new agreement with Sabre is similar to those with Amadeus and Travelport full participation and industry-standard capabilities that will allow teams using their full GDS function. Now only four weeks into this and we're working through our implementation plan where our target is to go live in the second half of 2021, which I think will coincide with return to business travel. In terms of content, we'll certainly have more than 90% of our content available through Sabre. And again, this is consistent with what we're currently doing with booked travel for in Amadeus. And we'll always have 100% of our content available through our SWABIZ and API business channels. And I said this before, I think it is worth repeating. 90% of domestic business travel being booked is coach. And I really think we have the best coach product in the industry. We have a great point-to-point network and that's strengthening with our new cities. We have low fares with incredible flexibility. We have industry-leading customer service and hospitality. You've heard about that today. We have a great loyalty program and we deployed our Southwest sales teams to our key markets. Our challenge in the past is that we weren't in the GDS channel, which is where most business travel is booked and that gap is closed. We intend to compete aggressively and that's what you expect of us and that's what we expect of ourselves. Based on what we're seeing and learning from our customers and also from outside research, our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly and by the end of 2021 perhaps, it could still be in the range of down 50% to 60%. But again, from our perspective, even if business revenue is smaller, post pandemic, there's still a lot of upside for Southwest. So these two commercial focus areas : first adding new markets to our network; and second our entry into GDS, ultimately means that more itinerary combinations exist with our network. We have more passengers, more revenue opportunities and very simply more opportunities to grow Southwest Airlines. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you Tammy. Tammy Romo : All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A. Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful team of Southwest warriors for their incredible efforts over the past year as we all dealt with the unimaginable impacts of this pandemic. The effects of the pandemic resulted in our first annual loss since 1972, ending our streak of 47 consecutive years of profitability, a record unmatched in aviation history. Our 2020 net loss was $3.1 billion. Excluding special items, our annual net loss was $3.5 billion or a $6.22 loss per diluted share. The biggest drivers of 2020 special items were payroll support proceeds of $2.3 billion that were an offset to salary wages and benefits which was offset by $1.4 billion in accruals for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs as well as $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions. While our bottom line results were disheartening, we made great progress last year in reacting to the pandemic and cutting costs, reducing capacity and significantly bolstering our liquidity. For fourth quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we continued to meticulously manage spending. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 37% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and increased 7% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel expense was the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease, down 67% with gallon consumption down 45% and price per gallon down 40%. Our fourth quarter fuel price was at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.25 per gallon, down $0.84 year-over-year. Following three quarters of lower fuel prices, energy market prices have increased recently. We currently expect a sequential increase of roughly $100 million in our first quarter economic fuel cost compared with fourth quarter, despite slightly lower gallon consumption estimates in first quarter. We estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $1.60 to $1.70 per gallon range. Our 2020 fuel hedging portfolio remained materially unchanged throughout the year and our premium cost per gallon increased in 2020 simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons consumed. Our fourth quarter premium expense of $24 million equated to $0.08 per gallon and our full year premium expense was $98 million, also $0.08 per gallon. Our 2020 portfolio outlook is similar to 2020 with estimated first quarter premium expense of $25 million and full year estimated premium expense of $100 million. Our hedging protection for 2021 currently reflects hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost tailwind from lower market fuel prices, our fourth quarter fuel efficiency improved 8% year-over-year, driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked and out of service, given our capacity cuts. Fuel efficiency is also being helped by lower load factors, as well as strong on-time performance. We expect this trend to continue in first quarter and currently estimate fuel efficiency to improve by 5% to 6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items and prior year profit sharing, fourth quarter operating costs were down 23% year-over-year, which was right in line with our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by the significant reduction in year-over-year capacity. Our fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 300 -- of $340 million of variable flight-driven costs, excluding fuel, primarily related to flights driven maintenance expense, the landing fees and revenue-related and personnel costs. We also realized cost savings from the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. We saved $425 million in salary wages and benefits in fourth quarter, driven by our employee voluntary leave programs; and we have reduced advertising expense and cut or deferred most of our projects and investments, as well as discretionary spending. We did have a few areas of increases in inflationary pressure, such as contractual pay rate increases, increases in airport rates and a greater pro rata share of airport expenses and higher aircraft rents from the sale leaseback transactions that we completed in 2020. In total, I am very pleased with our cost performance and continued cost control in fourth quarter. I'll spend a few minutes recapping our employee voluntary leave programs, since they are such a key component in managing our near-term cost. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees and that is 7% in the voluntary leave program, with 18% participating in extended time off. I would also like to thank our 15,000 employees who participated in these very crucial programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. The total cost of these two voluntary programs is approximately $1.8 billion, if none of the pilots on an extended leave are recalled before the end of 2025, for those that selected a five-year time horizon. In that case, the NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion. In terms of the accounting, we accrued approximately $1.4 billion of the total cost of the programs in 2020, and that covered the time period from second quarter 2020 through the end of 2021. The $1.4 billion accrual is reflected as a special item in our annual 2020 non-GAAP results, and includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program, and an assumption, that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off at least through February 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. The remaining $400 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will continue to closely monitor the demand environment, and of course record further accruals if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $450 million in 2020, pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarters. We expect 2021 cash payments for the program to be about $500 million, $175 million of that in first quarter. So, those are the basics of the accounting for the program. And in terms of cost savings from these programs, we recognized lower salaries, wages and benefits of approximately $425 million in fourth quarter 2020, and $565 million for full year 2020. For 2021, we expect $600 million in incremental savings over and above 2020 for an estimated $1.2 billion in total savings from these programs this year or roughly $100 million per month. We continue to expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million, beginning in 2022 and beyond. We are very happy with the success of these programs, which provide significant savings. In addition, the extended lead programs give us a lot of flexibility, should the business recover fast and we determine, we need to recall employees. Our swift self-help actions reduced our 2020 cash spending and outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with original plans. Breaking that down, our 2020 operating expenses excluding fuel special items and profit sharing were down $2.8 billion compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity drove fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received. The remaining cash savings were driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. This is a tremendous testament to our people, for their swift action and laser focused on strict cost control. Based on our current cost trends and capacity plans for first quarter 2021, we expect first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items to decrease in the range of 15% to 20% year-over-year. On a nominal basis, our estimated first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items are relatively in line with our fourth quarter results, as capacity remains down and we continue to benefit from savings, driven by reduced capacity levels as well as similar quarterly cost savings from our employee voluntary leave programs. While we are not providing full year 2021 cost guidance as long as capacity remains muted, we expect continued savings in variable flight driven expenses, such as salary wages and benefits, fuel consumption, flight-driven maintenance, expense and landing fees. We expect $600 million of incremental cost savings from our voluntary leave and extended time-off programs this year. And in terms of areas of pressure, we will have contractual pay rate increases. We anticipate rate inflation and airport costs. We expect an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as aircraft rentals as we resume a mix of owned and leased MAX deliveries and as we continue crucial technology and facility investments. We will also have more heavy maintenance checks in particular for our -800 fleet. Overall, changes in our non-fuel spending relative to 2020 will be mainly dependent on how our capacity plan evolves. To the extent, costs are rising as a function of more flight activity, it will need to be supported by a recovery in revenue and the focus will be on operating margin and cash burn improvements. On a fuel constant CASM basis, we continue to believe it is reasonable that we could get back to 2019 levels even with less capacity by the end of 2021. We had some cost inefficiencies this year from carrying excess staffing, which will impact our cost although we are economically covered with the PSP extension. There have been significant cost reductions across the industry. And I would just caution that many of them are temporary during this depressed environment. For Southwest, we are a growth airline with the cost structure to support growth and we don't believe we need to make structural changes to our strategy, business model, fleet and product offering. We are very well positioned for a recovery in travel demand and our focus on our long-term health and position within the industry rather than managing to a particular point in time during this pandemic. Our annual 2020 effective tax rate was 27.8% and being higher than the federal statutory tax rate. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be applied to prior tax years beginning with 2015. As a full cash taxpayer for the past five years, we are able to take full advantage of this CARES Act provision and currently estimate a tax refund from our annual 2020 net loss carryback of approximately $470 million, which we expect to receive later this year. The higher tax rate is due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher corporate tax rate of 35% in 2015 and 2016, until the passage of tax reform in 2017. For first quarter 2021, we expect our tax rate to subside back to normal levels and be in the range of 21% to 22% as the NOL carryback provisions available in the CARES Act are not applicable to years beyond 2020. Turning to fleet and CapEx. I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity, when the environment supports growth. As Mike covered, we are focused on returning the MAX to revenue service on March 11. During fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with Boeing to take delivery of 35 MAX eight aircraft through the end of 2021, including 16 leased aircraft. In December, we received seven of those which were leased aircraft and we expect the remaining 28 aircraft in 2021. Our current plan is to return 17 leased aircraft that expired this year, which would bring us to 729 aircraft at the end of this year well below our fleet of 747 aircraft at the end of 2019. We do not have an updated order book to provide beyond 2021 as we are still in discussions with Boeing to restructure our longer-term order book. During 2020 we returned 12 leased -700 aircraft and retired 24 owned -700s including the accelerated retirement of 20 owned -700s. Our decision to early retire these 20 aircraft resulted in an impairment charge of $32 million during fourth quarter treat it as a special item and we estimate that the operating savings will exceed this charge. And they will be replaced with new more fuel-efficient MAX 8 aircraft. We ended 2020 with 718 aircraft in our fleet. Our annual 2020 capital spending totaled $515 million which was more than offset by cash proceeds of $815 million from sale-leaseback transactions and $428 million in supplier proceeds received during 2020. When also factoring in minimal aircraft deliveries and the cancellation or deferral of the majority of our originally planned capital investment project for 2020, we significantly offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for the year. We were successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout the pandemic in 2020 and we will continue to do the same in 2021. Our recent agreement with Boeing included the settlement of 2020 damages related to the MAX grounding. And as a result of delivery credits provided in the agreement, as well as progress payments made to date on undelivered delayed aircraft, we estimate an immaterial amount of aircraft capital spend in 2021 and we currently estimate our annual 2021 capital spending to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology facilities and operational investments. Compared with our original planning projections prior to the pandemic we have reduced our combined 2020 and 2021 capital spending by approximately $5.5 billion. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We ended fourth quarter with liquidity of $14.3 billion including cash and short-term investments of $13.3 billion and our fully available $1 billion revolver. Since the onset of the pandemic, we were quick to reduce spend and bolster our cash position. We raised approximately $18.9 billion through debt issuances sale-leaseback transaction a common stock offering and payroll support program proceeds. Net of repayments we ended the year with $10.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet and we were in a net cash position of $3 billion and have leverage of 56%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets and that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards program. I am very pleased with our significant liquidity and substantial dry powder should we need it as the pandemic persist here in 2021. We are grateful for the recent PSP extension of the PSP funding. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for at least $1.7 billion of which $864 million has been received thus far in January. The remaining proceeds of $864 million are expected to be funded here in first quarter. The total proceeds will be funded as $1.2 billion in cash and $488 million in the form of a loan. We will also issue warrants to purchase nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock. And including the PSP funds received thus far our cash balance as of yesterday was $13.9 billion. Turning to cash burn, our fourth quarter average core cash burn was $12 million per day as expected. And this was a sequential improvement from our rate of $16 million per day in third quarter and a continuation of the sequential improvement seen through 2020, despite the deceleration in revenue trends in November and December. Given current revenue trends, coupled with a seasonally weaker travel period in January and February and rising fuel prices, we currently estimate average core cash burn for first quarter to be approximately $17 million per day. The $5 million per day sequential increase from fourth quarter is mostly driven by lower revenue and higher fuel prices. And keep in mind that our average core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. Including changes in working capital, as we defined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter 2020 cash burn was $15 million per day, $3 million per day higher than our primary core cash burn, driven almost entirely by fourth quarter payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs. We currently estimate our first quarter cash burn, including working capital, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per day, with the improvement driven primarily by changes in our ATL balance as bookings begin to build again, albeit not building at historical rates. One of our key goals is to achieve a cash burn breakeven in 2021. However, the timing of the necessary rebound in travel demand to meet this goal remains unpredictable. In closing, while 2020 was unpredictable and unprecedented to say the least, we are prepared for the current environment. And I am immensely proud of how our entire Southwest team is managing through it all. Coming into 2020, we had the strongest balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry and we maintain that position today. As we navigate through the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength and substantial liquidity. With encouraging news on the vaccine front, we are hopeful that demand will rebound at some point this year. But until that occurs, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to adjust capacity to varying demand levels and we will continue the momentum from 2020, in terms of our cost control and focus on efficiency. We are managing our cash burn and have made good progress despite the revenue environment. We are pursuing new revenue pools through network expansion in GDS and have continued to make prudent investments for future growth. We are preparing for the return of the MAX in March. And with the much-needed PSP extension, we have another year of job security for our people. As our people have demonstrated again and again, they have what it takes to carry us through this pandemic and we'll continue to be nimble as we manage through the uncertainties. We are blessed with many strengths, the greatest of which are our people. And I believe we will emerge from this environment, with even more competitive advantages and opportunities for growth over the next decade. As our founder Herb Kelleher would say, \"We will not sit on our laurels.\" And our track record speaks for itself. Our people are fighters and we are all up for the challenges ahead. With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey. Good afternoon. Tammy, this might be for you. As we get back to a bit more of a sustained demand recovery, what are your targets for liquidity levels, debt, CapEx? As you think about the priorities for cash as we get to more of a stable path to a recovery? Tammy Romo : Yes. Hey, Savi, how are you? I'll start with liquidity, because, obviously, as we manage through this pandemic, I think that's goal number one. So, of course, our goal there is to maintain sufficient liquidity. And it's tough to predict as we've been saying exactly when we'll hit an inflection point, but we intend to maintain a high level of cash until we are comfortably past the pandemic. In the current environment, we have agreed with our Board that a cash target for now of at least $10 billion is reasonable. And we can go down from there post pandemic as we return to profitability and repay debt. One thing for sure, this crisis has certainly reinforced our long-term imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage our debt. And, of course, we'll want to satisfy the adequate reserves for investments as we prepare for the recovery and our future growth. As always, we'll want to maintain adequate liquidity to weather a crisis, which seems to happen once a decade. As we set our targets here post pandemic, we'll want to be mindful that a large portion of our working capital is advance ticket purchases, which may not serve as a definite source of liquidity when we're in a crisis. So there are a lot of factors to consider with regard to liquidity and we'll continue to be thoughtful as we work together to maintain the financial health of Southwest. And as we manage through that on the CapEx side, I think, we've done an incredible job so far, but we want to be well positioned for the recovery and that we'll have some level of CapEx that we'll need to spend to continue to be prepared for the future. As I've already stated, we have very minimal requirements this year. And we'll want to manage that into next year, while at the same time, we'll want to continue to invest in projects that are important for our future, such as our GDS capabilities that Tom took you through. So, we're going to continue to manage that, but as our profitability returns to normal levels, I would expect our CapEx to return more to normal levels. And we're just going to have to manage that here as we go. Savi Syth : Helpful. And if I might just have a quick follow-up on the comment on ATL. Just kind of curious your current sales, how much of that is coming from credits versus kind of new cash and how that compares to a more of a normal environment? Tammy Romo : Yes. So just to give you just a little insight of what --- where our ATL balance is to help there, at the end of -- at the end of 2020, our ATL balance was about $7 billion. And the current -- we had a current liability of $3.8 billion and a non-current liability of $3.3 billion, about $4 billion of that was from our loyalty program or a little more. And about $2 billion represented travel credits that we've already issued. And then we had about $522 million that consisted of tickets, and with the remainder being things like gift cards and our early bird revenues, et cetera. So that hopefully, Savi will give you a little bit of help as you're thinking about what the breakdown might be ahead. Savi Syth : I guess, in terms of usage though, are you seeing a lot heavier -- I'm guessing you're seeing a lot heavier use of credits in current purchases? That's what I was kind of curious. Tammy Romo : Yes. During the fourth quarter, we had the credit redemptions, that was about 18% of our non-loyalty sales during the fourth quarter. And our hope, Savi, is that that would return to something more normal like 5%. Savi Syth : Perfect. All right. Great. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : And the next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Tammy, can you elaborate a little bit on the CapEx plans. You said -- I think you said $5.5 billion out. Can you bracket in the CapEx high and low possibilities for 2022, 2023? And also if you would how that ties to your fleet count outlook both high and low? Tammy Romo : Yes. Sure. As I said earlier, as we return to profitability, I would expect our CapEx to return to more normal levels. And if you go back historically, I'm going to call that about $2 billion. And I'm not saying today that's our guidance yet. We're still, as I said earlier, working with Boeing to restructure our order book. So, we haven't really locked that down yet. Obviously, we want to see how the demand environment evolves. And then also we do -- we will be focused on renewing our fleet and we'll want to pick up with our fleet modernization efforts. So, as Gary said at the beginning, it's all a balancing act. So, -- but I would expect our CapEx levels to pick up as we get past the pandemic to more normal levels that you've seen in the past. But right now I'm just not prepared to give you exact guidance because we haven't locked down our delivery book with Boeing. And as you know our largest -- the largest portion of our CapEx goes to aircraft. And -- but we'll want to continue to invest in technologies and our facilities and so forth. And as I've said already, in total, we're below $500 million. So, we may need to pick that up here at some point because we certainly want to be prepared and ready when we see that rebound in demand. Gary Kelly : And Hunter I'll just pile on here very quickly. I think that's a very fair question. And we -- I'm just not comfortable that we have an answer to that yet. So, it's -- nobody likes the answer it depends. Obviously, you already acknowledge that there's a high-low kind of a scenario. So, we owe you that bracketing. One of the things that I want us to do this year is to not think that we're starting over as a company, but there are some start-up-like aspects to this environment. And we're well-funded. We've got a lot of -- we've got a lot of institutional capabilities. We've got a lot of opportunities. We just don't have a lot of current demand. So, we don't want to behave as if we're going out of business and there are things that we would definitely like to invest in outside of the fleet which Tammy was referring to. So, all that, I want us to relook at, re-baseline our capital plan, and it really applies to both. It's not just aircraft, but it will also be the non-aircraft category. What we've been focused on so far obviously is survival and making sure that we screw down the spending that we're taking care of the health and welfare of our people and our customers. And those very appropriate questions you have aren't -- they're not pressing for 2020 and 2021, but soon they'll be important. I think the most pressing thing just to reiterate what Tammy said is that we are in a retirement phase. So, we will need to make some judgments about whether we want to keep airplanes longer, whether we want to stick with our pre-pandemic plan about retirements, whether we need to follow through with replacing. There is great opportunity with fleet modernization. So, those are all good questions. And then finally, Mike and Tammy are working with Boeing as you all know and we're right in the middle of that negotiation. That obviously factors in to answering your question. So, that's not complete yet either. So, there's work to be done there and we owe you an answer. We're just not quite ready to offer it up yet. Hunter Keay : Yes. No understood. Thank you. And then as you think about re-baselining things the operation and even for -- it's a fleet question too. How do you think about Hawaii now in light of what's happening with COVID and with the MAX? What does the MAX give you in Hawaii that the NGs don't? Gary Kelly : I think we're more enthused about a lot of things as we emerge from this and Hawaii is certainly one of those. But I don't know, if I'm exactly on point but -- with the way you're thinking about it, but we -- and maybe that's all you were looking for. I mean, we're -- we think the MAX will be better to serve the market and then the MAX seven is also a factor in the way we're thinking about Hawaii. So, I think we're going to do -- we're off to a great start there. Yes, I think we're going to do extraordinarily well. Tom, I don't know, if you or Mike want to -- Tom Nealon : Actually, Andrew and I were just talking about this before we came in. I just want to -- Andrew Watterson : Yes. Certainly, the MAX gives us certainly a better cost performance. So, immediately, the contribution of that sector of our network improves with the improved aircraft. Also, the NGs have payload restrictions going westbound and the high wind time of the year which is actually right now. So demand -- so the aircraft right now, so we're not really having to restrict the payloads. But normally, we would have to restrict the payloads this time of the year with the NG. The MAX with the greater range will be able to go full year-round to all the airfields we service. So that will also be an increment to our business gates in Hawaii. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Gary Kelly : Actually, just back to demand for a second, we haven't really talked about demand. The whole story is demand in my mind. We can talk about lots of stuff that's all demand and the Hawaii demand is actually pretty darn strong. And what we've seen is Hawaii, they've gone through I'm not sure how many executive orders we've actually had out of Hawaii. I think 12, 13 something like that, a lot of executive orders with different ways of managing through the quarantines and such. The pre-cleared program that they've put in place now that several carriers are leveraging it really does make the experience pretty straightforward. And the demand for Hawaii is actually very, very solid. So we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We're excited about Long Beach, what we're doing there. We're excited about opening up the San Diego service that was delayed. I guess, it was initially last fall Andrew, we just started that up. So I think the upside for us in Hawaii continues to be really significant. So, excited about that and the MAX eight as makes it even better. So, it actually expands the territory we can cover as well. So, new cities with that so. Hunter Keay : Thanks. Gary Kelly : Good to hear from you, Hunter. Operator : And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, I wanted to ask you about your recent leadership role at A4A. How does your involvement potentially change the posture at A4A? And how might priorities change given you're coming from a position of strength? Gary Kelly : Duane, we're -- we have one boat. And obviously, I never take my Southwest hat off, but this is my second stint as chair. So I think, we all understand how this works. It's a relatively small association. We have some new members. So, there's some administrative things to be addressed and some team building, if there's such a thing among competitors to do. But basically, we need to arrive at a strategy that we can all agree to. And then logic would tell you then there's things that we can't agree to. And then therefore that falls outside of the scope of what the association would work for -- or work on. So I don't know that it's so much driven by Southwest business, or our strength, or weaknesses so much as it is just what I'll try to do to lead the organization in a fair-handed way to be as productive as we can. I think the A4A is a very talented organization. We've been members since I think 1990. There was a time -- therefore there was a time that we were not members. So it's a long horizon. We think it's better to be -- have a seat at the table and be a part of that as opposed to not. And I thought the association did a great job in 2020 in particular. You got a new administration, which is a task in and of itself, as well as another stimulus that's being bandied about. So there's plenty of work to be done, and I'm looking forward -- I was honored to be asked to do it, and happy to volunteer, and I'll be spending more time in Washington as a consequence of that. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate you biting on that and the thoughts. Just for my follow-up and maybe you covered it and obviously everybody is trying to ask the same flavor question in 20 different ways. But given the cost savings that you have locked in and the fleet mix benefits when you get back to 2019 capacity levels how much better do you think your CASM profile will be? Thanks for taking the question. Gary Kelly : Yes. I'll let Tammy give you -- she is working on that and she no doubt can give you a more thoughtful answer. But I -- the way you asked the question is a good way to do it. I was really very pleased with the operational performance in 2020. And we got a bounce - the ball bounced our way in some ways because we were underutilizing the fleet. We had longer turn times. You had lower load factors and some things like that.  But it doesn't really reveal all the work that Mike and Andrew and the rest of the organization has been working on to improve our operational performance. What was intended to be addressed in 2020 and 2021 is further efficiency efforts with the schedule. And that's the real magic here in terms of being able to improve our cost effectiveness. And so I think we're all curious -- I'm just not ready to -- I don't really know what 2019 capacity looks like. We are horribly inefficient right now and still doing a pretty good job relative to our peers. So what we've got to do is get back to some kind of aircraft productivity and efficiency and then layer on top of that our initiatives that we had planned to see where we get. I'm very enthused about the progress we've made with the cost so far. I think you got this from Tammy's update. But basically if you strip out fuel the costs are -- they don't vary much from fourth quarter to first quarter which is pretty darn encouraging. So we've definitely stripped out a lot of costs. I think in terms of a lot of the more discretionary investment like programs and projects especially that were technology driven. We feel like we've gained significant efficiencies there post pandemic compared to where we were before. So good for us. And so I think a lot of those things should stick. Then you just get down to, are you going to have 85% load factors again? Are we going to have a dense scheduling opportunity again? Can we improve the turn and the ground time and continue on with some of the block time efficiencies that we were realizing? And if we can do all that I think we'll beat 2019 costs handily quite frankly. But that's in fairness I think that's speculative right now. I think we have a long way to go. Right now it's taking more people and more airplanes to produce an ASM than any of us like and far more than what it was in 2019. So I'm more determined to get us back there than I am so worried about what all the arithmetic adds up to. So that's -- Tammy, I don't know how you would answer that question. Tammy Romo : Yes. I don't know that I have really a whole lot more to add to that. But in addition to the opportunities to improve our efficiency as Gary took you through we have delivered some permanent cost takeouts such as our voluntary separation program. And we have accelerated the retirement of some aircraft here in 2019. And I think we have a proven track record on just the overall cost management side. So we'll continue to work hard there through the recovery. I did just want to note fuel because obviously part of that is dependent on fuel which has spiked recently. So we'll just continue to manage costs at a pace that I think makes sense relative to the capacity that we're adding back. The MAX return to surface will also be a factor. But as you all know, there's a lot of efficiencies that we're going to gain, as we start bringing the MAX back and replacing our older aircraft, given the significant efficiency of the MAX. And so we -- again, it's hard to commit to a specific CASM at a specific ASM level. That is time-based. So we're not going to give guidance there. But we do believe, we could hit 2019 CASM levels as Gary said, even while our ASMs are down. So, again just, as I said in my remarks, very proud of what everybody has done. Everybody's just rallied together here to reduce our costs and we're going to carry that on here, until we get to the other side of this pandemic. Gary Kelly : And I know you -- I'm sure you didn't take it this way Duane, but I wasn't criticizing what we're doing or complaining about our efficiency right now. It is what it is. So we have very thin demand. And we've done an outstanding job of sustaining a viable network, but it is not nearly as -- what we're forced to do is, far less efficient than what we know we can do. And I'm a little afraid that some of our -- well, I think trying to make a commitment on cost right now is getting the cost before the horse. So we need to know what demand is. We need to schedule to that. We need to make it as efficient as we can and then strive to get back to the level of efficiency that we had with our schedule back in 2019 and then add some. As Tammy said, there's some overhead and things we've taken out, but it's going to be all about the schedule. I think we're set up beautifully, to be able to execute better in the future on cost. And I think, we're all anxious to get there. When we'll hit that? Don't know. But I think we're set up as well as any of our competitors. In fact, I would argue we're set up better. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate the thoughtful response. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hi, good afternoon everybody. Gary, Duane's question is actually a good segue into mine. The good news obviously is that Southwest entered the crisis with an outstanding cost structure and your competitors didn't for the most part. The bad news and I guess, that's my question, is it bad news in your mind that some of your competitors are at least targeting pretty significant cost reductions, in their cases getting back to 2019 CASM but on significantly less capacity. So, if your cost advantage narrows, what do you think this actually means for Southwest? I know, Tammy sort of deflected the question in her remarks. And if memory serves, I did ask you a variant of this back in the 2007 time frame during the bankruptcy era. So, I'd love to hear your updated thoughts. Gary Kelly : Well -- and of course, relative to the last 13 to 20 years, our cost to manage has narrowed. And so I think your question then and my concerns then proved to be valid. I don't know what they're going to be able to do. I think, at least in terms of what I'm seeing right now, our costs are stickier as we shrink. We don't outsource a lot of stuff as you know, which is much easier to shed, and so we are more fixed and sticky on the way down. I think, several of you all have noted that as we grow back that will be to our advantage. So we'll see margin expansion because, we won't have the variable cost to attach to that as the revenue volumes come back. That's one of the reasons I wanted to point out the operational performance for 2020. As we -- it's all about the operation, when you get right down to it when it comes to cost. And we had tremendous learnings from 2020, just the fact that, I mean we could quantify the value of an on-time performance point, much more scientifically than what we've been able to do in the past. And it's things that we've all learned, if not in school then in our early years that when you have poor quality or you have waste, it is very expensive. So we've got a lot of wonderful learnings from that and a lot of good tools and techniques to apply with a lot of good initiatives coming forward. I know I'm being a little bit redundant. So those are things that I know. If our cost advantage narrows, I think I could point to the last 10 to 20 years and say, we're still really good. And it's more than just that. It's the five things that I mentioned that Herb was so proud of 25 years ago. It's the strong balance sheet. It's the strong liquidity. It's the great culture that we have, the excellent customer service coupled with having a low-cost structure and a low fare brand. It's all those things combined. So I don't see us losing that. We certainly won't lose it in the near-term. And the advantage is narrowed. My theory -- and you and I have talked about this. My theory is that those are going to ebb and flow and there may be a point in time where it will widen again. So it's kind of incumbent upon us to continue to innovate and look for those opportunities where we can beat the rest of the crowd. Jamie Baker : Gary, I promise not to ask the question for the next 13 years. Thanks. And that's my only question for today. Take care. Gary Kelly : Well, we'll see how this looks in 2034. Jamie Baker : Statute of limitations. All right. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : So, Gary, I guess I just want -- it's been a great discussion thus far. What is the focus for you looking forward? Is it getting back to full employment, getting back to the full schedule? Obviously, reaching cash breakeven is important but what about reaching prior profitability levels because you guys did drop to 60% to 70% of man hours to get to breakeven? What about returning back to margins and return on invested capital are those still important as well? Gary Kelly : Oh, yes, absolutely. And I think we'll just need to -- right now it's all theory right? It's just so theoretical because we're mired in this pandemic. So I hope you'll forgive me, skirting the question a bit here because what we really urge our leaders to do is focus on the next 30, 60, 90 days. It's just like having a patient in intensive care. So to be fair to your question, again, it links back to some of the earlier questions I was trying to answer from Hunter and Duane. If we get to the point, where our demand is roughly what it was in 2019, I think there's an easier way to formulate answers to your questions. If we've got a new normal that is significantly less than that, maybe we're breaking even and making a profit, but our traffic levels are 70% of what they used to be there's not a lot we can do in the near-term to honestly commit to you that, yes, we'll get back to the same return on capital there. I don't think it's possible at 70%. If we get back to 100% of customer volumes then it is a matter of where fares at that point, what's the mix of business and leisure. We can get wonky on all those things but it's just so far -- it's so theoretical from where we are today. My -- so I will answer your question. My focus is real simple and that's why I crafted my opening remarks the way I did. We need to strike the right balance here and we need to be realistic. We know that we can't generate the traffic we need unless we boost our flying. There is no reason to boost our flying if the traffic isn't going to be there. All we will do is waste money. So we have to be very focused on getting that balance right and reacting as quickly as we can. What we've tried to do is maintain optionality, so we don't prolong that recovery period. And I think that that's worked out beautifully for us, better than -- it can't be any worse than any of our other competitors. So I think we're in a prime position to do that and that is my focus. Now once we get to that point I think we need to work on resetting what our near-term targets need to be what kind of profits -- there was a question about capital spending. I think the capital spending depends on what is our profitability and what can we afford to do and still maintain a strong balance sheet. All that we'll need to iterate and I will welcome getting to the point where those are the kinds of things that we can then focus on. But our rally cry for our people this year is really simple. It is win more customers and stop the bleeding. That's what we've got to do. And that will put us on a platform where we can then get to the next thing, which will be let's pay down this debt and let's make sure that we are at a sustainable level of profitability that will then lead to what can we afford from a capital program for the next five years. So it's just an uncertain time like none of us have ever seen in our lives. And anybody that tries to give you a real specific answer to those kinds of questions, they're just -- they're not telling you the truth. And that's -- and that's the god's honest truth. We just -- we don't know, but we are prepared to manage and respond and we're determined to do it better than anybody else. Brandon Oglenski : Well thank you for speaking the truth Gary. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Well that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I know we shared a lot of information. Thank you all for the great questions. And if you have any others, feel free to give me a call. Thank you all for joining and have a great day. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Well thank you, Chad. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. And I think we can get right to the Q&A portion. So Chad, if you would give them inspections on how to queue up for a question we'll get started. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to see what you're hearing or if you're picking up anything about sort of additional requests for government aid, when the existing PSP expires at the end of March. You've said that you won't -- you don't plan to furlough any employees through the end of this year, regardless and just curious, if you see the industry kind of maintaining the same united front on the federal aid question, if not every airline equally needs the aid? Gary Kelly : Yes. Great question, Alison. So I'll just speak for Southwest at this point, because I don't have input from all of the member airlines within Airlines for America. But at this point, we would like to have a seat at the table. I know that unions have reached out like they did last year, urging leaders in the administration and Congress to provide more relief. We -- I will just -- I know you know this, but I'll just acknowledge that the theory with the second payroll support program was to simply extend what was done the first time, which was through September for another 6 months. And the payroll support program in rough dollars was $25 billion the first time around. Well it was far less than that here the second time around. And we're staring down another -- in terms of cash flow $1 billion losing quarter here in the first quarter, just like we had in the fourth quarter with higher fuel prices. So this has certainly not ended and it's anybody's guess what the second quarter will be. So this is all about protecting jobs. And we're the only airline to promise no job losses or pay cuts in 2020. We lived up to that. We promised the same thing again here in 2021. That doesn't mean that we won't have risk and concerns beyond this. So we're not promising this indefinitely. And all airlines are alike. So I think the short answer is it's too early to give you a specific answer, but it's definitely something that I'm glad the administration is looking at. I'm glad that Congress is looking at it. And I'm glad that we'll have a seat at the table here. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tracy Rucinski : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. The CDC said this week that it is actively looking at mandating COVID-19 test for domestic travel. Has it approached Southwest or A4A about this possibility? Mike Van de Ven : I'll speak for Gary. But Tom do you -- go ahead. Tom Nealon : Well I mean just to give you a few thoughts. I mean certainly the international stuff kicked in this past Tuesday the requirements there. And it was actually -- I wouldn't say it was a nonevent for us. We have your fairly underweight there if you will compared to OAs but that wasn't a problem for us. With respect to coming into the U.S. it's not clear -- first of all it's not clear if when, what, how we'd be asked to do that. But it's certainly something that we're thinking about. If it were something similar to what's being required internationally how would we do that domestically? And right now the international is -- it's a pretty manual process because it's sprung upon all of us so quickly so you got to get the technology and to scale that domestically. Well I will say what I think if that's -- if you don't mind. I think if we're ultimately going to be doing a domestic testing type of -- or type of protocol or regimen. I really don't think you want this being done by airport, by airline, by city, by state. I think as we say in Texas, that could be a real go rodeo. I mean it's going to be a real challenging thing for customers to navigate all of that if it's not consistent across the country. So I think that if we are going to do something, which by the way I don't think our government affairs team, our operations team or our customer experience team have really been given any indications coming. We're reading the same things you're reading the CDC. And we're anticipating hearing something from somebody but we're thinking about it. They want to figure it out fairly quickly. So our technology teams and CX teams customer experience is what CX is are thinking through how might we do that if it did in fact come to fruition but nothing known at this point. Gary Kelly : Yes. And I'm -- so specific to your question I'm not aware that the CDC has reached out to us. By extension I'm not aware that they've reached out to the Airlines for America. But yes, I think it would be a mistake. It's very costly. As Tammy was pointing out in an earlier interview to administer the test, we don't have adequate testing capacity for the country in the first place. Where our emphasis needs to be is on the two vaccines that are available and getting them rolled out and getting the country vaccinated. And I would hate for us to take our eye off of that ball. But I would just make the argument that why pick on air travel? If you want to test people test them but test them before they go to the grocery store. Test them before they go to a restaurant. Test them before they go to a sporting event. I think it's been well recognized that the air cabin is extremely clean and healthy and safe. And with the new administration mandating mask in the transportation sector, that's what we need the most which is hygiene, wearing mask, social distancing, which should now better extend in the airport and beyond. That's the right approach here. And I just think with the millions of customers who fly or ride buses or trains or whatever, it's just unrealistic to expect that we can efficiently and effectively do testing on a large scale. Tracy Rucinski : Well if I could just follow up. I think that part of the concern may be the spread of the new variants which are now in this country and there have been really strong messages from leaders in Europe for example discouraging travel. Do you see any kind of messaging like that coming either from the government or the industry out of concern that the progress that we have made so far could really just be -- could go out the window if these new strains go -- like today there was a case discovered in South Carolina. So if it's contained in South Carolina that's better than if it reaches California, for example. Gary Kelly : Well, no, that's a different question and a fair question. So and the answer is, no. No one has reached out to us about what we might need to do in that kind of a scenario. It's something that needs to be discussed quite frankly. But to your point, I don't know that testing would be an effective means to try to address that. I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience in trying to get access to test through friends and family is extremely difficult.  And that's before now you would mandate that you want more test administered. I just think it's wholly impractical. And obviously we -- selfishly we hope that we don't get to a point where we're prohibited from flying, but that's a different question and something obviously that needs to be addressed. But fortunately at this point, we're not dealing with a significant threat from these different strains. Tracy Rucinski : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question and that question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my call. Switching gears for a second. You guys now that you're filling your planes, just seeing a lot of chatter about when are you going to bring back regular food and drink service. Could someone walk me through the thought process there and any kind of timetable especially including the sale of alcohol? Thank you very much. Tom Nealon : Well, we're -- at this point, we went back to selling the full middle seat to the full plane. We thought at that point with the surge it probably made sense for us not to be having a lot of interactions between the flight attendants and the passengers which is what's required for the alcohol which by the way is what people care about more than anything else is selling alcohol, which is not a huge surprise.  So we're working through that at this point with our customer experience team and our provisioning team and operations and in-flight team are working through when does it make sense for us to do it? It very well can be sometime in the first quarter. I think a lot of it really does have to do though with what we're seeing in terms of case counts. And I just looked at the case counts before coming into the call and every state pretty much, I shouldn't say every I think there were one or two that were still going up. Case counts are down, hospitalizations are down and so on and so forth. And that certainly has a bearing on how we think about it. And so I'd say it's still a work in process. Our intent is to bring it back. We'd love to have it back in time for spring break. That is to be decided to be chosen and determined. But Mike, do you have anything you want to add on that? Mike Van de Ven : No, Dawn. It really is just a -- it's just an opportunity for us to limit face-to-face conversations with flight attendants and customers and people mingling throughout the cabin. And I think that does help reduce the risk and help us distance people more. At some point in time, as Tom mentioned, it's going to be the right time to start bringing that back. Hopefully, that's sometime toward the middle of the year. The other thing though that we've been very accommodating with for customers if they want to bring food or colas from the airports onto the airplane, we're very accommodating with that. Gary Kelly : But Tom and Mike have both covered it, but it's just to reemphasize. It is all about the health. I mean that's the only reason that we discontinued the service is to limit the face-to-face interaction. And obviously, we're encouraging people to keep their mask on. So those are the only reasons. Tom Nealon : The only thing I'd add, Dawn, is it's kind of interesting. Our customers miss their drinks and our flight attendants actually miss the engagement with our customers. That's the fun part of the job and that's where the person kind of sparkles through and they really miss it. So when we think it's time and it's safe. We can't wait to do it. Gary Kelly : We're coming into the winter with the discounts coming up. I think our folks made exactly the right choice, which is to not do it right now. And you can tell by all three of our answers that we're continuing to talk about it, but it's not a high priority for us to get it back and in service here until we're comfortable. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad and thank you for joining us today. If you all have any other questions you can certainly follow up with our communications group at 214-792-4847 or using our online newsroom at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. My name is Keith and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Keith and I appreciate everyone joining today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on today\u2019s call, we have our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven; our President, Tom Nealon; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. We have also have other senior executives with us for Q&A including Andrew Watterson, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President of Corporate Services. So a few quick reminders and then we\u2019ll jump in. We will make forward-looking statements today, those are based on our current expectations of future performance and that our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. We also had several special items in our fourth quarter -- excuse me in our first quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks as well. We have more information on both of these in our press release from this morning. So please make sure you check that out as well as our Investor Relations website. So with that, we\u2019ll get started and I will turn over the call to Gary. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 call. The first quarter results are notable, first of all, because they are a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement, we still lost $1 billion and it was worst than our fourth quarter results due to the weaker seasonality of January and February travel. And clearly that\u2019s not sustainable. But fortunately, we\u2019re here to report that we believe the worst is now finally behind us. We have a much better outlook and report for second quarter. And we\u2019ll give you a full brief on the first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. But here are a few topside highlights before I pass the call over to Mike. Number one, thankfully, we received a second round of payroll support or PSP from the federal government and effectively covering the first quarter. It was much needed. We\u2019re very grateful. We\u2019re the only airline who has avoided pay cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like, and I\u2019m very, very gratified that our 50 year record remains intact on that front. Not counting working capital, changes in cash flow, our cash losses of $1.3 billion were more than offset by the PSP. Number two, beginning with a mid-March inflection point, we finally began to see bookings improve from the nine month down 65% flat line that we had been experiencing. So vaccines, vaccinations, case counts and spring break, all converged in the right way. And sensing this, we boosted our capacity by 50% overnight or 1,000 daily departures in the middle of March. Number three, taking into account our voluntary separation program and attrition since June, our staffing currently is at 92% of our June 2019 levels. And in addition, we\u2019ve had thousands of people on leave. And now that we\u2019re adding flights, we\u2019re smoothly recalling those that are needed on voluntary leaves and having avoided the mess associated with furloughs. And as a result, we plan to apply 96% of our June 2019 ASMs, albeit with a different route network. The point being is that we\u2019re very well prepared to flex up our capacity. And even having said that, I think that we\u2019re very well aware of it, it will still be messy. And we\u2019ll have to carefully manage. Number four, now please understand that the path back to breakeven and beyond is dependent upon two things. Number one, we have to have sufficient flight and seat activity and you need to read into that, that means more than what we\u2019ve been doing prior to March. And number two, we\u2019ve got to have more customers to fill those flights, and obviously read into that revenue. So we have too much fixed cost for us to be profitable below roughly 3,000 to 3,300 flights a day. At least now it\u2019s realistic for us to project breakeven cash flow scenarios, which are possible here in the second quarter. So in summary, a lot of things here this morning. I\u2019m relieved, I\u2019m optimistic, I\u2019m enthused, I\u2019m grateful and I\u2019m especially thankful to our tens of thousands of employees who have fought their way through this pandemic and gotten us at least to this point. We\u2019ve got a long way to go. But I\u2019m very, very confident that we could all depend upon our selfless warriors, they\u2019re very resilient. And then finally, I\u2019m pleased with the performances. The operation has been superb. The new cities are meeting or exceeding our expectations. I\u2019m glad to have all of them as permanent additions to our route network. The addition -- our global distribution system capabilities could not have been a more timely add to our capabilities, as we\u2019re pushing aggressively into the huge managed travel business market. And we\u2019ve got a great domestic network, we\u2019ve got great service. And finally, they\u2019re going to have access to low fares. The cost and the spinning performance has also been excellent and we\u2019re making great progress towards restoring our historic productivity and efficiency. And then, I\u2019m absolutely delighted with the deal that we reached with Boeing last month that strategically secures our position as an all 737 operator with all the attendant competitive benefits that enables.  And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to our COO, Mike Van de Ven, who I know will elaborate more on that. But among other things, Mike great job, great performance. So take it away. Mike Van de Ven : Thanks a lot, Gary. And -- well, we really had an action packed start to the year, and I\u2019m very proud of our people and how they just continue to rise to the occasion. They\u2019ve opened up four new stations in the first quarter and two more in April, implemented a federal mask mandate, returned the MAX to service, secured a new long-term Boeing order book of MAX 7 and the MAX 8 and reached service agreements with GE and CFM International for the LEAP-1B engines and all of that while running an exceptional operation. So we ended the quarter with an on-time performance of 86.2%. And that was a good for third in the industry, and that included a reduction of roughly 4.4 points due to weather. As you know, we\u2019ve got large operations in Texas and the entire state froze for several days in mid-February, and that impacted our network; as well as a winter storm, Xylia, which impacted Denver as we launched into our March base schedule. So speaking of our March schedule, we returned the MAX to revenue service on March 11. Once we completed all of the maintenance requirements, the pilot training and we had a self-imposed set of 200-plus readiness flights on the airplane. The launch was limited to 10 lines of flying and the airplanes were separated from the rest of the fleet for the first month of service. On April 12, we increased the lines of flying to 55 lines. And the aircraft are now fully interchangeable across the network. We currently have 64 MAX aircraft in the fleet, and we have 32 of those aircraft currently out of service, awaiting FAA approval of repair instructions from Boeing. The repairs will ensure that a sufficient ground path exists for certain components of the electrical power systems. These aircraft were identified by Boeing as part of the specific production runs and the impact of MAX lines of flying are being covered by spare aircraft in our next-generation fleet. We\u2019re not experiencing any significant operational impact. And once we receive FAA approval, it will take 2 to 3 days per aircraft to make the repairs and then with all the aircraft work expected to be complete in roughly 3 weeks. So turning back to the first quarter performance, our bag handling continues to produce all-time best company results. We delivered 99.7% of all bags in plane without a mishandled claim. And as you know, we do that carrying more free bags than anyone in the industry. And we continue to lead all marketing carriers with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT.  Perhaps the highlight of the first quarter was securing a new long-term order book with Boeing for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 as well as our agreement with GE and CFM International to maintain the LEAP-1B engines. So we announced our order book on March 29, and there are just a couple of items that I\u2019d like to highlight. First, we added 100 firm orders for the MAX 7, which will be the replacement aircraft for our 737-700s. We also converted 70 MAX 8 firm orders to MAX 7 firm orders, and that brings our firm order book for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 to 200 and 149 aircraft, respectively. We also added 155 options for either MAX 7 or MAX 8 aircraft, and that brings our total number of options to 270 aircraft. And the interchangeability of the options of -- between aircraft types, that just gives us tremendous flexibility.  So when you put all of that together, we are maintaining a substantial operational and economic efficiency as a result of a single fleet type and the LEAP-1B engine provides at least a 14% better fuel efficiency, quieter engines and it has excellent dispatch reliability to support our on-time operation. We intend to retire a significant number of our roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and the MAX 7 is best-in-class aircraft for us in that 150-seat category. Just like the MAX 8 is the best-in-class for us in the 175-seat category. The acceleration of our fleet modernization I think makes great economic sense. It also reduces carbon emissions and noise levels, which, of course, is better for the environment. And it also provides a superb cabin experience for our customers and our employees. Looking forward into the second quarter, we have a couple of important capabilities that we\u2019re going to add to the operation. First, we\u2019re in the final stages of obtaining ETOPS certification for our MAX 8 fleet. So the MAX and its fuel burn advantages roll out is not only to reduce our operating cost to Hawaii but it\u2019s also going to allow us to fill all 175 seats in winter wind conditions. And that\u2019s something that we can\u2019t always accomplish with the next-gen fleet. And that was our plan all along, but of course, the efforts were delayed as a result of the MAX grounding. Second, we\u2019re going to begin a fleet transition to an all-new maintenance recordkeeping system beginning with our 737-700s later this month. And this system replaces our [Wizard] system, and that system is nearly 30 years old. This new system provides us a foundation for real-time maintenance recordkeeping, paperless records, improved planning, better analytics and automated controls to enhance regulatory compliance. Once we complete the transition of the -700 fleet, then the -800s and the MAX will follow later this year. So just in closing, I can certainly feel the operational momentum building, and I have to tell you, it feels good. We are in the process of bringing our entire fleet back into an operational status. We\u2019re coordinating our staffing to ensure that we\u2019re resourced to fly at whatever our desired levels are. And we\u2019re introducing new capabilities and navigating through an environment that continues to be impacted by COVID. And our people are just magnificent. I can\u2019t say enough about them. They do all of these things. They still run a great operation, and it\u2019s amongst the best we\u2019ve ever delivered. And they\u2019re just the best team that I\u2019ve ever been associated with and my deepest thanks to each and every one of them. And so with that, President Nealon, over to you. Tom Nealon : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I\u2019m going to try not to repeat what you\u2019ve already heard. But I do want to provide some color regarding first quarter\u2019s revenue performance as well as some perspective on near-term trends and our outlook for the second quarter. So as you know, the first quarter, operating revenues decreased 52% year-over-year or down 60% compared with the first quarter of 2019, and this is better than we were expecting 3 months ago when we last spoke with you during the January call. February operating revenues ended up about 5 points better, in March about 15 points better than our estimates in that same time. And that has really been the story over the past few months. We have seen steady and very encouraging improvements in leisure travel demand and bookings week after week, really since about mid-February. We saw a very nice improvement in March with operating revenues down 10% year-over-year and down 54% compared with March of 2019, which again was better than our guidance range of down 55% to 60%.  March load factor was 73%, also better than guidance, and passenger yield was down 34% year-over-year. Yields were down quite a bit for the months -- for the month once we got into March. But once we got into March, rather, fares improved each week as we saw demand steadily increase. Close-in bookings held up well. We also began to see the booking curve extend further out. Keeping in mind that business travel remained fairly stagnant, which I\u2019ll hit on in just a few minutes, I\u2019d say that we were really very pleased with March\u2019s overall performance. We were able to get a very good base of bookings in place for March early in the booking curve, and we did this through very targeted promotions that we ran back in December, January and February time frames. And once we got into March, our revenue management team was able to do a really nice job of managing our inventory close rate of managing yields. And as expected, spring break performed really nicely, very well. It\u2019s bigger than just the spring break story. The entire month of March really saw a steady build in passenger traffic. And just to give some perspective, March\u2019s load factor was 20 points higher than what we experienced in January, and that was actually on higher capacity as well, which I think really highlights the pent-up demand for leisure travel that we\u2019re seeing. And what\u2019s encouraging is that this momentum continues into April and in our last investor update that was in mid-March, we estimated April operating revenues to decline 45% to 55% versus 2019. But since that update, we\u2019ve experienced steady improving passenger volumes and fares. So we\u2019re now estimating April operating revenues to decline in the 40% to 45% range versus 2019, and that\u2019s with a load factor between 75% and 80%. Now the Easter Holiday weekend at the beginning of the month performed very well as we expected, and leisure traffic and bookings for the remainder of April hasn\u2019t slowed down a bit. In our earnings release, we gave our first estimate for May revenues, which shows further improvement in comparison with April\u2019s outlook. We estimate May operating revenues to decline in the 35% to 40% range versus 2019, with a load factor in the 75% to 80% range. And as we experienced in April, May holiday and non-holiday time periods are both looking very well in terms of our leisure demand. And with these improving demand trends holding their patterns since mid-February, it really has provided us a much better opportunity to manage the booking curve for April, May and beyond. Our revenue guidance for April and May includes the expectation of sequentially improving load factors and also improving passenger yields when compared with March. We expect the yields will still be down compared to 2019 levels, but that should be fairly intuitive, given that we are almost solely reliant on leisure travelers at this point in the recovery. Now that being said, though, we have been pleased how well close to demand performed in March and is trending so far for April. At this point, we aren\u2019t quite ready to provide an outlook for June, but I will say that we\u2019re seeing bookings increase further out in the booking curve and they\u2019re building faster. Now it\u2019s still pretty early in the curve for June and July, but I will tell you that bookings are building nicely at this point and shaping up seasonally as you expect for leisure travel. So in a normal year, at this point, we would expect to be around 60% booked for May; roughly 35% or so booked for June; and around 20% booked for July, and we are currently in the hunt with those levels of bookings. Now with June being one of our highest demand summer months, our current expectation would be for June\u2019s revenue performance to be better than May relative to 2019, but we\u2019ll provide you with the June revenue outlook as part of our investor update in mid-May.  Now as vaccination counts rise, the travel restrictions ease and leisure demand increases, we are obviously pretty encouraged. It feels good, and there\u2019s a feeling of optimism. But as you know, the improvements rather skewed heavily towards leisure demand now into the summer and simply too early to make much of a prediction on travel demand for the fall and we are very mindful of the fact that the demand recovery may not be a strength and quick path back to pre-pandemic levels. Which brings us to business travel. Our corporate managed travel revenues were down 88% in the first quarter versus Q1 of \u201819, which is consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 results. However, we did see some modest improvement later in the quarter, in particular in March, where corporate revenues were down 85% versus March 2019. And based on what we\u2019re seeing and hearing from our corporate customers, it continues to be very clear that domestic business travel will certainly continue to significantly lag leisure recovery. And for now, we are planning for a scenario where business travel will still be down 50% to 60% by the end of this year. Now having said that, we are, in fact, seeing more and more of our customers beginning to allow their employees to get off the bench and fly and travel and they\u2019re beginning to unfreeze or relax their travel policies. But although that\u2019s happening, we just aren\u2019t seeing the volumes come back at this point. Now if you buy into surveys -- and I guess I\u2019d use the word buy into surveys, the most recent GBTA business travel survey suggested that roughly 60% of respondents expect to resume domestic business travel in the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I guess we\u2019ll see. Time will tell in terms of the pace of business travel recovery. And it\u2019s also not clear, to be honest with you, what percent of traditional business travel ultimately returns. Our view is that there could be a 10% to 20% reduction in business travel either permanently or at least for some extended period of time. But having said all that, however, the business demand curve shapes back up, I can tell you, as Gary alluded to just a moment ago, that we are really well positioned. In fact, this is the best positioning we\u2019ve already had in terms of going after corporate business travel. You\u2019re all very aware of the GDS initiatives. I\u2019m not going to go on about that, but it closes a huge gap in our corporate travel capabilities. As you guys know, we are live on Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo and World span today. And we are very far down the path to implement the Sabre GDS platform in the coming months, and we have a targeted go-live date that we will implement prior to Labor Day. So really good progress on this front, and the teams are doing an incredible job. So we\u2019re feeling very good about where we are. Our sales teams are out in the market. We are engaging with our customers at a very high level and very frequent level. And the response has been incredible. So I think we are really well positioned to gain some revenue and perhaps will gain share. Shifting gears to regional demand, I just want to give you a little bit of color on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the different parts of the network. In general, our leisure markets where restrictions have remained low continue to outperform the rest of the system very nicely. Beaches, mountains, sun and ski are all performing very well, which is totally consistent with what you\u2019re hearing from the other carriers as well.  A little more specifically to our network, we are seeing strength in our Texas markets, Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. We\u2019re also seeing strength in really all of Florida, but in particular, on the Gulf Coast of Florida, which includes Panama City, Pensacola, Fort Myers, Tampa. The Desert Mountain region is performing really nicely, which includes Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise. Denver is also performing very well. So there\u2019s a lot of strength within the network. Demand continues to lag in areas such as the Northeast. Chicago is lagging a bit. California is lagging a bit, although it\u2019s really improving since the restrictions are being lifted. So we are seeing improvements across the system, which is encouraging. And honestly, whether cities have been lagging or outperforming, what we are seeing is that all markets have improved fairly significantly recently compared to where they were in January and February. So as a result of what you just heard, we are comfortable adding back flights to capture additional demand, including Hawaii. And it\u2019s great to see demand from California to Hawaii as well as between the islands ramp back up. And we\u2019re finally at a point where we can get to our Hawaii flight schedules up to where we hope we\u2019d be a year ago before the pandemic. As you know, international testing remains in place. Overall, I\u2019d say our international demand is performing just fine, not a lot to report. At this point, we are only serving 8 of our 14 international stations, and we\u2019ll intend to bring the remaining 6 back online as it makes sense and as restrictions ease. A little color and perspective on new stations. At this point, we have opened 10 or announced 17 new airports and all of them are performing terrific. In fact, there\u2019s not a clump in the bunch. All of them are generating new customers, additional revenue and collectively are contributing positively to our cash performance. We feel really good about what we are seeing in our first 10. And more to come. So we\u2019ll begin service in Fresno on April 25; Destin/Fort Walton Beach on May 6; Myrtle Beach on the 23rd of May; Bozeman, Montana on the 27th; Jackson, Mississippi on June 6. And we also just announced last week Eugene, Oregon will begin service at August 29, and we will begin service in Bellingham, Washington later this year. So all the new stations that are operating today are meeting or exceeding our expectations. They\u2019ve been on our radar for years, and it\u2019s great to see them open operational. And honestly, it\u2019s kind of -- it\u2019s pretty interesting. I think our network planning team is batting 1,000%. So this is really something and the operations are starting up really cleanly. In terms of our capacity, for the first quarter, capacity decreased 35% year-over-year. It was down 39% compared with first quarter of 2019 whichwas consistent with our expectations. And as planned, we added -- as Gary alluded to, we add additional capacity in March, which equated to roughly 1,000 flights each day beginning mid-month. And that really paid off as demand improved. And these incremental flights improved our March performance by roughly $150 million -- that\u2019s revenue performance by $150 million. Our April capacity is expected to decline 24% and May capacity is expected to decline 18% relative to 2019 levels. Now this includes a modest increase in flying in April and about 3 points of incremental capacity in May compared with our previous guidance, which is really just the result of a stronger demand outlook. At this point, we are in the process of adjusting our June flight schedules. And once the revisions are complete, we expect June ASMs to decline 4% versus 2019. And as you\u2019ve seen throughout the pandemic, actually, we\u2019ve cut more business-oriented short-haul flying and added more leisure-oriented longer-haul flying as well as [work linking] itineraries. which is driving higher capacity with newer aircraft, and this makes up roughly 4 to 5 points of the 14-point sequential capacity increase from May to June. And assuming the current trends continue, our preliminary plans for July call for similar levels of capacity as June relative to 2019 levels, and we\u2019ll be finalizing our July plans here very shortly. So in terms of passenger revenue and capacity, our focus remains on managing the next few months with as much precision as possible, which is what we\u2019ve been doing throughout the year and improving our revenue performance as well as improving our cash burn performance toward breakeven or better with an emphasis on or better. That\u2019s our goal. In terms of other revenues, our other revenues performed better than passenger revenue in the first quarter and was down 15% year-over-year. For March, though, our other revenue was actually up 3% year-over-year, our ancillary products, specifically commissions from car, hotel and vacation bookings performed about in line with passenger revenue, no surprise there. But the biggest contributor to our other revenue performance was our Rapid Rewards program. In the first quarter total revenue from our loyalty program was down 19% year-over-year or 22% versus 2019. When you look at it, at just the royalty revenue that flows through other revenue, revenue was down 12% versus 2019. This is a very strong performance, especially relative to passenger revenues. And I think it just speaks very clearly to the strength of the program as a whole and the high level of engagement that we have with our customers and they, with us.  The sequential improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by increases in retail sales and commissions on new card acquisitions. Total co-brand card spend in March was only down 1% versus March of 2019.And for the first time since the pandemic began, our credit card portfolio size grew in the first quarter, again relative to 2019. So we\u2019re thrilled to see that. So our credit card portfolio remains very strong. We\u2019re seeing the average spend per cardholder continue to improve. Our attrition continues to be very, very low, and we are really very pleased with the performance of our program. And I think you can see in our results that we have more Rapid Rewards members, more credit card holders and more engagement from our customers. And now we have more places for them to go, with a lot more leisure destinations. And building on that, our brand remains very strong. Our brand NPS scores continue to rank at the very top of the industry, which is something that we focus on and watch a lot, we watch very closely. Our trip NPS, which measures individual flight experiences, is trending even higher right now as well, which speaks to our people\u2019s focus on hospitality and producing great on-time performance. So as Mike said, and I am so grateful with our frontline employees, they execute every day with precision and grace and I\u2019m thankful for that. And finally, I do want to share a few comments and our perspective regarding our focus on the environment, which seems appropriate since today is Earth Day. Now Gary has already shared our long-term goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050, which is aligned with A4A\u2019s goal as an industry. And this isn\u2019t a new topic for us. Though this is something that we\u2019ve been focused on for a long time, our focus has certainly intensified over the past year. But just for perspective, since 2002, we\u2019ve invested more than $620 million in fuel efficiency initiatives and that\u2019s independent of new aircraft. And in 2019, we saved more than 7 million gallons of fuel through flight planning initiatives. So this is something that, again, is not new to us.  And as Mike discussed earlier, we plan retiring a significant number about roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and we\u2019ll be investing billions of dollars on new aircraft that are 14% more fuel efficient. And as it stands today, the carbon emissions that we generate on a per ASM basis is among the very best in the industry, and our fleet modernization program gives us a massive opportunity to continue to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions over the next 10 to 15 years. So that\u2019s all great. We also know that fleet by alone isn\u2019t nearly enough to get us to our goal of carbon neutral by 2050. In our views, the most promising path over the next 10 to 15 years is a combination of fleet modernization, operational fuel efficiency initiatives, air traffic control modernization and the introduction of economically viable, sustainable aviation fuels or SAF at scale. Today, we have a SAF offtake agreement in place with Red Rocks Biofuels, and our teams continue to work with the National Renewable Energy Lab, or NREL on the development of new SAF feedstocks and pathways. We\u2019ve also recently signed MOUs with both Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 to accelerate the production of SAF, with the objective of achieving affordable SAF with low carbon intensity scores at scale. And the crux of the agreement is to work together toward the production of 300 million gallons of SAF in the 2025 time frame. This is a very ambitious target, and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of work to be done, but it\u2019s also a really important step forward. And we intend to work very closely with both Marathon and Phillips 66 throughout the process, with the intent to secure large offtake agreements that represent a significant share of the SAF that\u2019s produced. But to be honest, this effort is not just about Southwest securing more SAF for Southwest, it\u2019s also about getting large energy producers into the market, getting production to scale at affordable prices.  We also believe that the use of carbon offsets can be appropriate and helpful, but we see this as a bridging technique. Our use of offset so far has been focused on renewable energy credits, which are natural gas offsets to complete our headquartered campus 100% renewable energy plan. And up to this point, we have not been using carbon offsets. But if used appropriately, again, they can be helpful, where it\u2019s making offsets available to customers or corporations who are looking to offset their travel emissions. So more to come on this, but again, we see offsets as a bridging solution. Direct air capture, new airframe and engine technologies and new energy sources such as hydrogen, power liquid or PTL also have tremendous promise, but we see these things as being much further out, call it, 2035 and beyond. And our objective is to focus on things that we feel like we can have a real impact on over the next 10 to 15 years. So this is something that we are absolutely committed to achieving. But to be really clear, the industry is going to have to work together, no single airline can do it well, it\u2019s just impossible. So it\u2019s going to take a lot of work with a variety of organizations, including the private sector and nonprofits as well as strong support and policies from the federal government and state governments. And we\u2019ll need innovation and scale in the energy industry. And will also need continued advancements in the aerospace industry to become carbon neutral by 2050. Now Gary has asked me to be the executive sponsor for our environmental efforts, and I\u2019ve asked Stacy Malphurs, our Vice President of Supply Chain, who is extremely knowledgeable at SAF and in end-to-end fuel supply chain to take this on with me as well.  So to wrap it up, we\u2019ll be providing a comprehensive report of what we are doing and the progress we\u2019re making in our Annual Sustainability Report, which we call the Southwest One Report, and we\u2019ll be publishing this online to our Investor site in the coming weeks. So with that, Tammy, I\u2019m going to hand it over to you. Tammy Romo : Alright. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll round out today\u2019s comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $116 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which included $1.2 billion in payroll support. Excluding this benefit and other special items detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, our first quarter net loss was $1 billion or a $1.72 loss per diluted share. While our losses persisted in first quarter, I feel good about the progress we are making, in particular, as we move through second quarter here. I want to commend our people on another solid cost performance as we have to remain extra diligent with our spending.  Excluding special items, our first quarter total operating cost decreased 24% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and increased 17% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel represented about 35% of that decrease. Our first quarter economic fuel price of $1.70 per gallon was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and our fuel expense declined 44% year-over-year. Reduced capacity levels resulted in gallon consumption down 37%, the largest driver of our year-over-year decline and economic price per gallon down 11%. We realized a modest hedging gain of approximately $1 million or $0.01 per gallon, and our hedging program premium costs were $25 million or $0.09 per gallon. While fuel price was still below year ago levels, energy prices have been creeping up over the past few quarters, which only serves as a reminder of the importance of having a consistent and meaningful fuel hedging program. We have great hedging protection in place, with hedging gains beginning at Brent prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range, and more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel and higher. Based on market prices as of April 15, we expect our second quarter fuel price to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, including another modest hedging gain of $0.01 per gallon. Looking at 2022, we also have a high-quality fuel place -- fuel hedge in place with a similar level of protection. But we would start recognizing hedging gains around the $60 per barrel Brent range with more meaningful hedging gains beginning at $70 per barrel and higher. Last year, we took the opportunity to add our 2022 hedge position while prices were lower. Our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parts. Some of the current fuel efficiency gains are temporary as we\u2019ll see some sequential pressure as we return more of our older 737-700 aircraft to service this summer. However, we currently estimate our second quarter fuel efficiency to be sequentially in line with first quarter\u2019s ASMs per gallon, partially due to returning the MAX to service last month. The MAX is our most fuel-efficient aircraft, and we have a line of sight to more significant improvements over many years as we plan to retire a significant amount of our 737-700 aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years. We get at least a 14% fuel efficiency improvement on a per aircraft basis, each time we replace an end-of-life 737-700 aircraft with a new MAX. This will be a big driver of progress towards our long-term environmental goals.  Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, first quarter operating cost decreased 19% year-over-year on the better end of our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by the 35% reduction in capacity. We continue to realize cost savings from our actions taken in response to the pandemic, including $412 million of savings and first quarter salaries, wages and benefits driven by the benefits of our employee voluntary lead programs implemented last year. We had pay rate increases for our people that are flowing through this year, but the voluntary program savings far offset that rate inflation. Outside of salary wages and benefits, we had year-over-year decreases in most other categories due to reduced capacity and the related cost relief, primarily in the areas of maintenance, landing fees and employee customer and revenue-driven costs. In terms of a few other notable items in first quarter, aircraft rental expense was $52 million, down 9% year-over-year, driven by the return of leased 737-700 aircraft. Advertising spend has increased sequentially from fourth quarter as we ramp up the marketing, but our first quarter advertising spend was down 8% year-over-year. And we realized onetime favorable settlements in first quarter, primarily property taxes, and those are reflected in our other operating expenses. Again, our first quarter cost performance was solid, and I appreciate all the work our teams are doing to manage costs in this unprecedented environment. Turning to second quarter, we currently expect operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year and also to increase sequentially compared with first quarter. We estimate that 60% to 70% of the expected sequential increase is due to variable flight driven expenses as we plan to increase capacity to near 2019 levels by June. To support the increased flight activity, we are recalling a portion of our employees who had elected our voluntary Extended Emergency Time Off program. In terms of salaries, wages and benefits expense. Sequential cost increases from a few items account for about 1/3 of the total sequential increase. We have increases driven by a higher number of active employees in second quarter, including the impact of recalled employees. Roughly half of our recalled employees will return in second quarter and some training will be required for those employees that we recalled as we prepare for them to go back to work.  Partially offsetting our second quarter cost pressure from these recalls is an estimated $325 million in cost savings from our voluntary separation and extended leave programs for those employees that took a voluntary separation last year and those employees that remain on extended time off. With some early recalls, we now estimate annual 2021 cost savings from our employee voluntary program to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from our previous estimate of $1.2 billion. Outside of salary wages and benefits, the largest drivers of our sequential cost pressure are flight-driven cost increases and landing fees, employee, customer and revenue-related costs, and maintenance expense as we prepare aircraft that have been parked for a return to revenue service as well as higher flight driven maintenance expenses as flights resume. These ramp-up costs combined represent the other 2/3 of our capacity-driven sequential cost increase. Outside of capacity-driven cost increases, we expect sequential cost pressure driven by airport cost inflation and higher aircraft ownership costs due to the MAX deliveries. And this rounds out the majority of the remaining cost increases. While we are facing expected sequential cost increases that naturally come with increased flight activity, we expect our second quarter operating cost to remain below second quarter 2019 levels. And we expect that our ramp-up cost pressures will vary and persist until we get capacity back to 2019 levels. That said, we remain laser-focused on cost control as we navigate through this recovery. Our first quarter interest expense was $114 million, in line with fourth quarter and assuming our current momentum continues, we don\u2019t currently anticipate raising additional debt. And based on current levels of debt outstanding and current interest rates, we expect second quarter interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was in line with our expectations. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Mike covered the highlights of our Boeing agreement. I just want to add my thanks to the teams at Southwest Boeing and GE and CFM International for their tireless work to develop agreements that extend and support our long-term relationships and that supports all our Boeing 737 -- our all Boeing 737 business model. Based on the refreshed order book and our retirement plans over the next 10 to 15 years, I feel very comfortable with our ability to manage the size of our fleet, support fleet modernization and pursue growth opportunities as they arise. And we can do this in a cost-effective manner, in particular, with manageable CapEx. We ended first quarter with 730 aircraft, including 61 MAX 8. For second quarter, we expect to receive 7 MAX 8 deliveries and retire 3 737-700s. And we will have 1 more MAX 8 delivery in third quarter and retire up to 6 more -700s by the end of the year. Beyond 2021, we are going to wait a bit longer before we make a decision about 2022 fleet plans and 2022 CapEx. That said, we are well positioned to begin retiring roughly 30 to 35 737-700s a year, beginning next year. Our firm orders should cover a majority of our fleet modernization plan, and we will make decisions on exercising options based on the economic and demand environment and based on growth opportunities and capacity plans. As Mike mentioned, our options provide us tremendous flexibility. As expected, our first quarter capital spending was $95 million, and we currently expect our full year 2021 capital spending to be roughly $500 million, with an immaterial amount of aircraft CapEx and driven mostly by technology, facilities and operational investments. We have plenty of flexibility to manage CapEx with our order book, with aircraft CapEx on firm orders of $700 million next year. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We currently have approximately $14.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, in line with where we ended first quarter. We are thankful to our federal government for providing continued economic relief to protect jobs as the pandemic persists. We received $1.7 billion in payroll support program proceeds during first quarter and expect to receive an additional $259 million as our final distribution of the second round of PSP support or $2 billion total from the PSP extension. We are currently working to finalize our agreement with the Treasury on the third round of PSP support and expect to receive an additional $1.9 billion. Our liquidity position provides a solid foundation as we operate in the wake of 2020 substantial losses and on the heels of another substantial non-GAAP loss in the first quarter. Our first quarter average core cash burn was $13 million per day, a $1 million sequential increase from fourth quarter with rising fuel prices offsetting improving revenue trends. The material improvement in revenue began substantially in March, resulting in an $8 million improvement from our February cash burn of $17 million per day to a March cash burn of $9 million per day. When you include the benefits from future cash bookings and other changes in working capital, as we define for you in our earnings release, we flipped positive in March and produced cash flows of $4 million per day. Assuming the continuation of positive revenue trends, we expect our average core cash burn in second quarter to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. And we continue to expect to achieve cash burn breakeven with roughly -- with revenue of roughly 60% to 70% of 2019 levels. Barring any unforeseen changes in current demand trends, our cost trends and assuming revenue and booking trends continue to build throughout second quarter, we are hopeful that we can achieve core cash breakeven results or better by June. In closing, while the effects of the pandemics persist, our Southwest team continues to conquer both the familiar and unfamiliar challenges of the day. While we aren\u2019t out of the woods yet, we are encouraged by the rise in vaccinations that seem to be unlocking the pent-up leisure demand that we all believed was there. We are optimistic and hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we are mindful that business travel continues to significantly lag leisure. We will continue to manage our business closer in to focus on what we can control, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, reducing our cash burn as we work towards breakeven and managing tight cost control and seeking efficiencies, especially as we began to revamp capacity levels. I am immensely proud of how our people continue to persevere and show up for our company, our customers and each other. Working together, I am confident that our best is yet to come.  With that, Keith, we are ready to take analyst questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is with Stephen Trent with Citi. Stephen Trent : Just one quick one for you. Tammy, I was intrigued by what you mentioned about your hedging policy. And you guys also mentioned the approach to climate change with renewable energy credits. Are you thinking about the energy credits and lower emissions, and your fuel hedging policy going forward, are you thinking about them in conjunction with one another is, let\u2019s say, a holistic approach to these topics? Tammy Romo : Yes, absolutely. Well, they\u2019re kind of really two different topics in mind, but we are certainly thinking about them all holistically. Our fuel hedging program, as you know, we\u2019ve had that in place for many years to provide us protection about against rising fuel prices. And looking forward, a component of that will be sustainable aviation fuels. We\u2019re just not at a point today where we\u2019re at significant volumes there with sustainable aviation fuel. So I see that being more relevant with time. But as we look here this year, over the next several years with the hedging position that we have in place, the purpose of that is really to protect against conventional fuel, which is obviously going to be what we\u2019re heavily reliant on. Stephen Trent : Appreciate that. Tom Nealon : Yes. Steve, I think that to get SAF up to where it needs to be, there\u2019s going to have to be some sort of market making going on. And there\u2019s going to be some level of incentive, tax credits for the producers or the blenders or the consumers. So I\u2019m not sure -- I think Tammy and I are both kind of early in exactly what the tax benefits are for all these various ESG-oriented elements we\u2019re going to be investing in. But I think that that\u2019s part of we have to create in order to make SAF really viable and economically viable, if you will, going forward. So, I think it\u2019s kind of an open question, to be honest with you, at this point. Operator : And the next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : So, Gary, as you -- Southwest has a long track record of looking out for your shareholders. Obviously, you and others diluted a lot during COVID. So, what do you think is the best way to sort of repay your shareholders? Is it through buying back that stock? Is it through special dividends, or is it really just sort of just taking the money, investing it back in the business and just trying to grow the stock price through earnings? Gary Kelly : I think it\u2019s really a ways away before it\u2019s a real question for us obviously, because we\u2019ve got CARES Act limitations that, Tammy, go, what? Through... Tammy Romo : September of \u201823. Gary Kelly : \u201823? 2023. As you\u2019re well aware. So, it\u2019s opposed that environment. So, I do think we\u2019ve tried to be clear that our priorities would be pay down the debt, number one; and then number two, grow the business. And obviously, we think that that\u2019s the best way to maintain the health of the enterprise, but also the best way to take care of all of our stakeholders, certainly our shareholders. And I\u2019ll let Tammy add if she wants to. I just think it\u2019s premature to telegraph what our thoughts might be ultimately in terms of shareholder returns. I\u2019m not a fan of special dividends. I don\u2019t mind sharing that. So, I also don\u2019t mind sharing that I haven\u2019t had that thought that we would be doing a special dividend, and we couldn\u2019t do it until post September 23rd -- or 2023 anyway. But it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got four phases, however, that we\u2019re thinking of. One is survival; second is stabilized; third would be repair; and then fourthly would be back to prosperity. So, we\u2019ve sort of declared that until we stop losing money, we\u2019re still in the survival mode. So, that\u2019s a rule out there for what we\u2019re thinking. Once we get to prosperity, I\u2019d love for us to get back to handsome shareholder returns, and I just feel like we need to prepare the balance sheet first. I got the question this morning on CNBC, and I thought it was a good one. We view share repurchases as you well know. We had a healthy dividend going into pandemic, as you well know. We also had the strongest balance sheet and the lowest leverage in our history coming into 2020, and all of that is key in terms of thinking in the future about what we would do with shareholder return. So, we\u2019ve got to get our balance sheet back in order. It\u2019s not broken, but we do have some work to do. And that\u2019s -- I know we\u2019re all aligned here that that\u2019s our top priority. Hunter Keay : Yes. No, I appreciate that color. And just a quick one here for you, Gary as well. I know this is -- seems crazy question, but if demand sort of doesn\u2019t get a whole lot worse, but it doesn\u2019t get a lot better either when we find ourselves looking at PSP 4 maybe attached to the infrastructure bill or something like that. Is that something that you expect to happen or would advocate for, or would actively say we don\u2019t need it? Gary Kelly : Well, not any -- I will admit that\u2019s not anything that I\u2019ve contemplated. I\u2019m very grateful that we\u2019ve gotten not one, not two, but three PSPs. And I guess, to be totally open on the question, we\u2019re -- we feel like we\u2019re on the cusp here of achieving breakeven. It\u2019s hard for me to argue that Southwest would need any further support. Now, the premise that you raised, of course, is that -- if I could sort of extrapolate that it was achieved and we sort of bump along -- with my comments initially, yes, our first quarter turned out better than we thought it would be, but we still lost $1 billion. Well, that can\u2019t go on indefinitely for any company and certainly for an airline. So, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re staring down. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at $1 billion loss second, third, fourth quarter. So, given that, I -- which is the only way I can really answer the question. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in that scenario. So, therefore, no, because this is a live question on this infrastructure bill, and then finally, no, we\u2019re not advocating for anything different other than just trying to provide our input on the spending and the investments that are being contemplated in that bill, along with the prospect of corporate tax increases. So, that\u2019s our focus. Operator : And the next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Gary, can you just share a little more detail on what the early conversations with your corporate customers or potential corporate customers have been now that you have widespread GDS integration? Is it different from your existing corporate customers, given that kind of you\u2019re one of the first LCCs to enter the space? Kind of how are those conversions trending? And how is that customer base looking versus what you initially envisioned? Gary Kelly : Yes. The managed travel accounts definitely are behaving differently than our non-managed travel accounts. And I\u2019m going to let Tom and Andrew speak to that. Tom Nealon : I was hoping you would. So, let me just talk about the business travel for just a second. So, the industries that are starting to pop back up again, I consider business demand is falling as opposed to leisure demand, which is hot. But the areas of the business demand that are starting to travel, it\u2019s a lot of government DoD. It is manufacturing, some transportation, the areas that are not traveling are the big consulting firms, which by the way, are the biggest consumers we have of their travel. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s really not happening yet. I think that in terms of the conversations with the large accounts at this point, given that we are now on GDS platforms, we were talking about this before, we\u2019re starting to see the channel shift that we expect to see, given that we\u2019re now on four GDS platforms. And I guess the honest answer is, the volumes are so low, it\u2019s just hard to know if we\u2019re seeing what we would have expected to see in terms of channel shift from one to the other. We are seeing a little bit of a shift -- I think, Andrew jump in, if I\u2019m not correct here, is a little bit of shift from the Sabre BBR, basic product into more of the standard GDS platform. So, that\u2019s working well. But, I guess just in general, the commentary we -- our teams talk with, in fact, they did a great piece with Hunter. I\u2019m not sure if you guys read it. Took a while to read it, it\u2019s pretty long but it was really good. But the conversation was really such that the customer really gets our products. They really want the product. We\u2019ve just been so hard to do business with, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the conversations with our large corporates are really very, very positive and they just want us to be on the shelf in Sabre and the others, and we will be. So, we have seen a follow business travel, I think. Andrew Watterson : This is Andrew. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is that these TMCs and corporations, we already have relations with them because through our direct connect and our SWABIZ platforms, their customers now just was not their preferred platform. So, I would think about more of expanding our book of business with them, rather than introducing ourselves to these new corporates and TMC. So, the fact we\u2019re moving to something that\u2019s more they\u2019re liking, has received good returns from them. So, that\u2019s why we expect to do better post-pandemic and pre-pandemic with the largest corporations who had more of a standardized process that would go through the GDSs. Operator : And the next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Gary, I -- earlier, I saw a headline out about you making a comment about business travel rebound, not taking place for about 10 years. And I\u2019m just curious the context within that comment. And I don\u2019t know if it was a misquote or maybe there\u2019s some analysis that you guys have done, or maybe it\u2019s your point referencing that maybe some portion of business is never going to come back. Can you just sort of clarify or qualify that statement? Gary Kelly : I\u2019d be happy to, Mike. And honestly, there\u2019s nothing new. I\u2019ve said 10 years for a year. And my only point was it was really in -- and you\u2019re expert at all of this. We\u2019ve just lived through an environment where it is impossible to forecast. It\u2019s impossible to predict. We can all pontificate. And so, all I\u2019ve been saying is really in response, Mike, to a question about will business travel ever recover. And I think it will. I think it\u2019s silly to sit here and say it will never recover. I mean, that\u2019s a bold statement. But, Mike, it could be a long time. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ve thrown out the 10 years, and I\u2019ve done that consistently. You know that a typical recessionary recovery is five years for business travel. And we\u2019ve lived through a lot of recessions together. So that I feel confident of. What I\u2019m not confident about is whether this is a typical recession, number one, and it\u2019s got some pluses compared to a typical. It has the negative because of everything that we know about being able to work now with technology virtually and remotely. And that is a huge question mark. I\u2019m on another Board besides Southwest, talk to other CEOs, talk to all my friends and colleagues here at Southwest, and we get plenty of anecdotal information that suggests that business travel will not recover to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. So, there\u2019s just no way to know. So, no, I\u2019m not predicting it\u2019s 10 years. Really, what I was trying to do is sort of tamp down the argument that it will never recover and just simply to say that, who knows? It could be a long recovery time period, but we\u2019re going to be prepared, Mike, regardless. And so, Tom and Andrew were just talking about GDS. And for Southwest, I think that we will recover business travel faster because we have a new avenue to gain business travelers. And we dramatically under-indexed the managed travel market. And that was because we weren\u2019t a part of the GDS. We remedied that. We\u2019re the largest airline in the United States. By virtue of that, I would argue that we\u2019re the largest business airline in the United States. And as I said in my remarks, now the managed travel accounts will have wide access to a great network, great service, no bag fees, no change fees and low fares. They will finally have access to low fares. I think, we will do extremely well there. Mike Linenberg : Great. That context was very helpful. Just my second question to Andrew, with the cities, 10 that have been announced, I think, out of 17, interesting, when you think back historically, Southwest was an airline that was very sort of tactical and methodical and sort of additions, maybe one, two a year, maybe some years, no cities. And now all of a sudden, the deluge of cities, and some of these are actually small markets. And if I think back to Southwest in the past, some small markets, the Company historically may have struggled. What -- it sounds like the ramp-up is going fairly well. Andrew, maybe what has changed that you feel much stronger in moving into some of these smaller markets and more quickly? Maybe it\u2019s just the pandemic. You strike when the iron is hot, maybe it\u2019s the density of the Southwest network, small cities can plug in and you can turn on and be successful far easier today than the Southwest of 10 years ago? Maybe I answered the question. But, if you could just give us some color because this is kind of a different mode for Southwest with respect to new city development. Andrew Watterson : Certainly, I\u2019ll be happy to answer, and Tom, feel free to join in. We are methodical. And so, prior to the pandemic, we have a practice every year of going through and looking at every place we could fly our aircraft and evaluating them at least in desktop, if not in-person visit. So, all these cities were ones that were known to us and evaluated prior to the pandemic. And so, when the pandemic, as Gary talked about, we\u2019re unsure about the pace of business travel return. And so, because we have a lot of business travelers, if they were not to return in a timely manner, we would have a shortfall in revenue activity to deploy our people and assets against, and with the operating leverage model, you don\u2019t want that. So, we want to make sure we have enough new cities to cover any potential shortfall in that return. So, that led us to go at a bigger scale than normal. The cities we chose, we chose also to have a low-risk as far as our maturation. And we\u2019ve been in plenty of small cities for a long time. So, our Western Texas cities and Pac Northwest cities, they\u2019re modest, and we do quite well, Upstate New York. And the key is the small city that is relevant to a place where we have a large customer base. And so, if you look at all these small cities, they\u2019re either in marquee destinations under themselves or they\u2019re relevant to a nearby large Southwest city, where we have a large customer base who would be big purchasers of tickets to these small cities. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to us. And then we want to make sure we go in with at least a level of flight activity that allows for crew efficiencies so that we have origination and terminators that make us not to have crude deadhead that would undermine inefficiency. So, all those things must come together for us to add those new cities. So, I think we\u2019re prepared and it fits with our model, I think, is the answer. Gary Kelly : Hey Mike. And I just want to pile on very quickly. If we kind of reconcile to 1992 when you work on our secondary offering in those states, if you remember our rule of thumb, but it\u2019s -- we didn\u2019t want to go into a city in the early 1990s, unless we thought we could do, let\u2019s say, 8 departures a day. And so, I wouldn\u2019t translate what we\u2019re doing with these 17 cities as being a violation of even that old rule of thumb, because some of these \"small cities,\" I think, Andrew -- I won\u2019t name names because we may not want to telegraph yet, but there are a handful that I can think of that you might think are small. We\u2019re thinking there are going to be a dozen or more daily departures, into a number of nonstop destinations. So, if you think, the fact that we now have such a large U.S. presence, it makes a lot of these \u201csmaller markets\u201d much more viable today in terms of flight activity than it did 30 years ago. But, the other thing I would point out is that Miami isn\u2019t small. Bush isn\u2019t small. Colorado Springs isn\u2019t small. O\u2019Haire is not small. So, we do have a few cities that have three or four daily departures on the route map. And I would -- Mike would call those small. And we have experience with them, and we know that they can work. I don\u2019t think that that means that every city like that would work. But, anyway, it\u2019s -- we have been delighted that we could actually have the capacity to put them on the route network here. I got asked earlier today about whether we\u2019ll continue this. And I think Andrew is going to need -- assuming that we continue on our recovery path, he\u2019s going to need to take a lot of these airplanes and put them back into restoring flight activity into our existing network. So, that will challenge our ability to continue doing this play, but they\u2019re permanent adds, and we\u2019re delighted with the performance that we\u2019re seeing. Tom Nealon : I think, at least just to give a little more -- this is one question, so we\u2019ll move on quickly. So, we\u2019ve got about 45 aircraft or so, Andrew, I think, committed to the new states so far, about 8% of the trips. But as I talk about the business demand thawing, as it begins to thaw, we\u2019re going to need to begin to get our network back in business travel shape. And just to give you a little view, I guess people are asking -- ask us, so what does the -- so when does the network get back to normal? Well, the network is not going to get back to what it was because we had 17 new cities on the network. But, what I can tell you is, when you think about the principles in the characteristics of the Southwest network, those will be intact. Point-to-point, you should expect to see a very similar mix of short, medium, long, a similar mix of direct and connecting traffic. And our focus, once we begin to see business on unthaw is we got to begin to put the depth back into the markets like the St. Louis and Milwaukee\u2019s and intra-Cal [ph] business markets and such. So, it\u2019s going to be an interesting. But that\u2019s also why we\u2019re getting more aircraft. So, we\u2019re going to retire some, going to have some incrementals. So, it\u2019s going to take time, which is fine because business traffic is not going to show up on one Sunday and all of a sudden it\u2019s back. It\u2019s going to take time, and we\u2019ll begin to build our fleet back in our network depth back. You spurred a lively topic their Linenberg. So, thank you. Mike Linenberg : Yes. I appreciate everyone. I appreciate the responses, and especially the early \u201890s reference, Gary. I remember carrying everyone\u2019s bag. So, it was a fun time. Gary Kelly : The thing that really pisses me off about you, you don\u2019t look any different. Mike Linenberg : You can\u2019t see me. Operator : And the next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Gary, you did mention four phases here, survival, stabilize, prepare, grow, I think it\u2019s the way you laid it out. It sounds like you\u2019re going to go through stabilize and prepare pretty fast here just with your June capacity outlook. So, I guess, I just have one question, because I know it\u2019s been a long call, but investors are wondering how are you going to take advantage of your net debt position, especially relative to some of your larger competitors that have other capital priorities in front of them. Is the view here that potentially you\u2019re going to grow into a marketplace, potentially take share? Could that sustain lower fares in the future, or should we be thinking, what -- we really want to get back to prior profitability before we push a lot of these fleet and network expansion opportunities that you guys just discussed? Gary Kelly : I think, we want to keep all options available, and we\u2019ve got a great balance sheet as it stands today. We will absolutely have to get back to profitability regardless. We\u2019ve got to get back to profitability. And I already conceded the balance sheet repair will be an objective. Tammy is already rethinking liquidity targets as well that will be more robust perhaps than what we had before. So, there are several things that we\u2019ll want to think through. But clearly, we\u2019re in a position where we have that option. We can pay down more debt more quickly or we can think about expanding more rapidly as compared to some baseline. And it\u2019s just too early to judge that yet. But, we have tons of opportunities. We\u2019re a growth company. We know how to manage growth, and we would be foolish to pass on what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime to grow this airline in this environment. We are so well positioned. If, in fact, the business travel stays modest over the next 5 to 10 years, we are perfectly positioned to prosper in that environment with our low cost and our low fares. Operator : And the last question in this session comes from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : Hey everybody. I got to tell you, I really like Mike\u2019s question. I remember being in Telluride with them about 20 years ago embedding on the one market that you might open that year. And I\u2019m sure the idea of mantras never crossed either of our youthful minds. But, it\u2019s a good segue into my question. Is there a reservation or IT issue that prevents you from flying to Canada? Gary Kelly : Tom, do you want to talk about that? Tom Nealon : Yes, there is. So, to make Canada work for us, that\u2019s both the business and leisure market, we\u2019ve got to be able to sell. Again, it\u2019s back to the whole foreign currency for point of sale that we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. That\u2019s the thing we need to get done. And Jamie, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s uncomparable technical capacity we don\u2019t know how to do. It\u2019s just a question that we keep putting GDS. And GDS, we have these other priorities kind of popping up, we had the ETOPS. So, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know how to do it. It\u2019s just that it keeps getting knocked down the list in terms of priority. But, it\u2019s just a piece of work around the foreign currency and foreign language that we keep talking about that we just keep de-prioritizing because there\u2019s a bigger idea. But it\u2019s really as simple as that. But we think there\u2019s probably 5, 6, 7 really nice markets, which, by the way, is part of the reason Bellingham is now in the schedule, right? So, there\u2019s some nice Canadian markets that can really do very well on the Southwest network. It\u2019s just going to take us -- just got to get a little more time to get that on top of the list I think really. Gary Kelly : I totally agree with everything Tom said, but I would just reemphasize our previous conversation to his question, which is, okay, we\u2019ve added these 17 destinations. We got a lot more we\u2019d like to add. I don\u2019t know that we would have airplanes. Even if we tackle that technology challenge, I don\u2019t know that we would have airplanes to be able to add those new markets. So, I guess, the point is, Jamie, I don\u2019t consider it to be an IT obstacle for Southwest at all. It\u2019s whenever we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll commit to that. We\u2019ll get the work done. We\u2019ll add it to our route network. Right now, we got all we can eat with the current capabilities we have. Jamie Baker : Got it. And a follow-up to an earlier point, you mentioned that consultants are still pretty much grounded. Pre-COVID, can you remind me what your top three businesses were that make up corporate revenue, and what percentage of your corporate spend, they represented? Top 3 or 4. Gary Kelly : Specific companies or industries? Jamie Baker : I doubt you\u2019re going to give me the companies. Industries\u2026 Gary Kelly : I can\u2019t remind you, because I never told you. But, I\u2019ll see what Tammy and Tom have to say. Tom Nealon : I think I\u2019m -- and you probably know which is now more. But certainly, defense is a big deal. It\u2019s not a industry, but DoD is a big traveler for us. Certainly, financial services, banking is big. It\u2019s certainly professional services consulting. In fact, if you look at the BTN 100, that\u2019s every major Tier 1, Tier 2 consulting firm is in there. They are big. Transportation, manufacturing. So, the list goes on and on. Higher ed actually. The state of California, higher ed is a pretty big deal. So, there\u2019s a long list, I guess, is the point. There\u2019s a lot of money tied up in it as well, so. Andrew Watterson : I think what\u2019s more important is it\u2019s not 80-20. Our largest ones make up a very, very small percentage of our corporate book of business. Our corporate book of business is a long list that each one can -- we appreciate them all, but it\u2019s a modest number compared to our overall revenue line item. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, give me a call at 214-792-4415. Thank you all for joining us. And Keith I\u2019ll send it back to you. Operator : Yes. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Keith. And I\u2019d like to welcome the representatives of the media to our call today. We can go ahead and get started. So Keith, if you would give them the instructions on how to queue up for questions. Operator : Yes. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. I\u2019m sorry. The question is with Alison Sider of the Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Thank you. Hi. Yes. I wanted to ask about the latest issues with the MAX. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about this? How you -- if it affects your ability to build the confidence in the plane, given that there was a lot of betting and new issue just cropped up? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Hey Dawn. This is this is Mike. And the issue with the airplane was it was specific tail numbers that were identified by Boeing as part of a production run. And they made certain changes in that production run and may have caused some electrical ground and bonding issues in a couple of different components. And the risk there really is -- was just inconsistent electric occurrence to those systems. I think that we haven\u2019t had -- we had had no issues or any identification of that being an issue with our own operating experience of the airplane. And I think the issue is well understood by Boeing. It\u2019s well understood by our engineers. And I think it\u2019s a relatively straightforward repair on the airplane. And as soon as the FAA comes out and approves Boeing service bulletins, we\u2019re ready to execute that repair. And I think, like I said, it\u2019s just a one or two-day repair on the airplanes, and it\u2019s relatively straightforward. Alison Sider : Got it. And I\u2019m curious, is there any -- when you found out about the issue a couple of weeks ago, what was the reaction? Was there any frustration to be kind of in this position again so soon after bringing the plane back? Mike Van de Ven : Well, yes, I mean, I think it\u2019s frustrating to have to go through that process again. I don\u2019t know if lucky is the right word to it, but we had a -- we had plenty of spare airplanes where the -- in terms of an operational issue, it was not a concern for us. But overall, Dawn, I think Boeing is a good company. I think they\u2019ve clearly suffered over the last several years, maybe with various quality issues across some of their product lines. But at heart, they\u2019re an engineering company, and I feel like they need to be leaders in the aerospace and the commercial businesses for our country. And I think they understand that, and I think they\u2019re going to get back to their roots. And I have a lot of confidence that the MAX airplane is going to lead the way there. Operator : And the next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : I have two questions. First question is for Tom. Have you guys seen any impact from the State Department\u2019s alert level that they raised, as you get back when the CDC started the testing requirement, or is it too early? What are you seeing there, if anything? Tom Nealon : Could go ahead and just elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re talking about, not really familiar with what you\u2019re saying, Dawn. Dawn Gilbertson : This week, the State Department has been raising the alert level for international countries, including such popular places as Mexico to better align with the CDC rankings. So, now more than 80% of countries including, like I said, some popular destinations have a higher alert level. And I know sometimes bookings take a hit when that happened. I wondered if you see any impact at all or expected? Gary Kelly : I know what you\u2019re talking about now because where my kids booked. Tom Nealon : So, the answer is, no, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really seeing much of an impact on that at all at this point. What\u2019s your second question? Dawn Gilbertson : The second question, I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s far. When you guys were recalling flight attendants recently, one of the things you cited in one of the memos was increase in people calling in sick. I\u2019m curious why you\u2019re seeing an increase in people calling in sick? Are you seeing an increase in infections as -- COVID infection as travel has rebounded, or are there reluctant, some flight attendants to return? Can someone talk about that a little bit? Thank you. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. I\u2019ll jump in there with that and then anybody else can add a little bit of color. But, our labor contracts have a very -- we\u2019re very flexible for our people in terms of their sick banks and how they use sick. And it could be a variety of things. It could be family issues that they\u2019re dealing with. It could be daycare issues that they\u2019re dealing with. It could be illnesses of their selves; it can be doctors\u2019 appointments. And as we\u2019re recalling people and they\u2019re coming back into work, I would argue that they don\u2019t have -- they don\u2019t have all of their personal lives all laid out as neatly as they normally would. And so, I think we will see a spike in that as people are coming back to work. But, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s in the indication of a long-term trend or a big operational hiccup for us. We have reserves that will cover those lines. And we\u2019re navigating through that pretty well. Operator : And the next question comes from Kyle Arnold with the Dallas Morning News. Kyle Arnold : What are you seeing in the airfare environment? And are you going to be able to hit some of your financial goals with the leisure travelers still -- the leisure travel is very fickle in terms of airfares still leading the way? Tom Nealon : Well, I guess, I\u2019ll start, and Andrew, feel free jump in. But, like I described earlier in the call is, I think the leisure side is pretty hot right now. I think the business demand side is starting to thaw. But I literally have right in front of me what our -- what the booking curve and the fair curve looks like for the upcoming months. And they\u2019re pretty solid, and they\u2019re really encouraging. So, barring a trend change, I feel pretty good about where we are, and it\u2019s kind of back to what we said in the call. Barring a trend change, we feel good about the opportunity to break even, perhaps you can make a little bit of a profit sometime in June or beyond. So, I think that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019d answer at this point. Now, as the booking curve begins to get more extended out further out, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we manage the inventories and the fares, and it\u2019s starting to take a normal booking distribution shape, if you will. The level is too low, but the shape is normal. So, we\u2019re able to manage our pricing more effectively, and that\u2019s kind of where we are. So, we feel good barring a trend change. Andrew Watterson : The guidance that Tammy and Tom gave you includes the -- what we saw in the spring of the leisure fares getting stronger from the bottom of the winter wave through towards the summer. However, the lack of business travel that Gary and Tom talked about maybe some of the higher fares that they pay will be absent. So you can -- our fares overall will still be down year-over -- two years and year-over-year as a result of that. Gary Kelly : So, Kyle, this is just talking about -- our peers on average were down 20% in the first quarter. So, this is -- we\u2019re not -- we never give information about what we\u2019re going to charge. So, that\u2019s -- they\u2019re not speaking to that. We\u2019re just talking about how the array of fares that we have average out with the demand that we have. But, I would just say this. The industry has more seats than it does passengers. And Economics 101 tells you that pricing will settle that but at a softer level. So, we were down 20% this quarter. And what we\u2019ll be prepared for is a very low fare environment for a long time, which gets back into the discussion that we\u2019ve been having all day about business travel demand. And that is our wheelhouse. We are low cost. We are low fare. And we can live on low fares. And we\u2019ll certainly make sure that we manage our business accordingly. Operator : And the next question comes from Leslie Joseph with CNBC. Q - Leslie Joseph : Two quick things. On the MAX, are you getting any compensation from Boeing, either in the form of payment or discount on other planes? And, do you have any sense of how much not having those planes and services costing Southwest? And then, my second question, if you want, I could wait till after. Tammy Romo : Yes. This is Tammy. In terms of the pricing on our aircraft with Boeing, that is confidential. We have shared with you that the CapEx that we have with regard to our firm order book for next year is about $700 million, and that is for 30 aircraft. But, it\u2019s just not that simple. There\u2019s a lot going into that. And as you\u2019ve alluded, that incorporates discounts from previous settlements that we\u2019ve had with MAX, with Boeing on the MAX grounding, as well as the terms of our most recent agreement. But, the actual trends itself are confidential. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. And are you talking more specifically to this most recent grounding? Q - Leslie Joseph : Yes, the electrical issue. You get -- and is there -- do you know what the financial impact is\u2026 Mike Van de Ven : Yes. We\u2019ve got our arms around what we think that impact is. I will tell you just in the scope of our operation, it\u2019s not material. But, there are new airplanes. The airplanes are warrantied by Boeing. And I think that we have -- I don\u2019t think that will be a concern for us at all. Q - Leslie Joseph : Okay. And then, my other question is, what are your staffing needs for this year? And then, going into next year, do you expect to hire? And do you think that too many employees might have left the Company permanently? Because I know some employees who run temporarily were getting called back early. Gary Kelly : Well, I think I can maybe start with this, and I\u2019ll maybe add some of my friends around the table talk. But, the real question is, we\u2019re looking for the commercial side of the business to be able to go since the demand out there, and we\u2019re looking out five and six months, and then be able to lay out a schedule that responds to that demand. And I feel like we have a lot of flexibility on the airplane side and on the staffing side with plenty of notices to be able to go fund that. So, just to be honest, we can do any of the things. If demand falls off from here, we\u2019re in a good position. If demand stays flat, we\u2019re in a good position. If it increases, we have ability to recall people on EXTO. And if it really explodes, we have the ability to go hire people. And so, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s tricky. And we\u2019re trying to make those decisions as close in as possible. So, we haven\u2019t really thought about the second half of the year yet. Mike Van de Ven : I\u2019ll just summarize some comments that I made at the outset of our analyst call, which is, we are currently at about 92% of our pre-pandemic staffing. And of course, you pick a point in time and you can judge that number around. But that just gives you some sense. And what Tom was talking about was flying our June schedule at 96% of what we were pre-pandemic for June. We\u2019ve had a little bit of attrition. We\u2019ve had a voluntary separation program. And that\u2019s what gets us down from 100% down to this 92% level. So, we are comfortable -- we\u2019re overstaffed right now in March, April. Projecting forward to June, we would be right at the proper staffing, if not a little bit short. So, there\u2019s pluses and minuses. One department might be a little over; one department might be a little under. But, I think beyond -- to Mike\u2019s point, beyond June, I think what we\u2019re all anxious to see is, well, what do things look like when we get to June. Are we going to hit our forecast as we\u2019ve anticipated it with the bookings for July, August, September, look as good as we hoped? Is there pent-up demand that is not sustained beyond that? I mean there\u2019s just a number of good questions that can be posed at this point. So, it\u2019s just a little bit premature. But, if we get to the point where we\u2019ve got some staffing challenges, I think everybody here would consider that to be a really high-quality problem. But, Bob Jordan is here with us, and Bob heads up our Corporate Services, which includes HR. So, In terms of our current hiring, our current hiring plans, you might just share whatever you\u2019re willing to share there. Bob Jordan : Yes. You bet. And on the recalls, so we -- gratefully we had about 11,000 folks take the EXTO and just a terrific response for our employees. And we\u2019ve recalled just south of half of that to meet the demand that everybody\u2019s talked about here for the summer. And if you -- yes, if you see more demand, we can be in a position to continue the recall. We have begun to ramp back up our hiring ability. So, before you can hire, you\u2019ve got to have people that went off and did their jobs come back and sort of rebuild that team. So, we are ready to hire. That\u2019s very modest right now. It\u2019s key positions. But, I think if we see the demand continue, we are in a position to ramp that back up quickly. Gary Kelly : I do think -- again, to be straightforward about this, I think, we\u2019re all prepared for this to be messy. It\u2019s just not easy to predict, and then it\u2019s not easy to execute. And we also don\u2019t want to end up with excess staffing. So, it\u2019s just trying to strike the right balance here. It was really messy a year ago trying to downsize the airline. And I think, we\u2019re all just going to have to recognize it will be -- I think, we need to be up to the task here and manage well, but just recognize it may be messy. Now, having said that, our operation went up 50% in terms of flight activity overnight back in March and had a flawless execution and outstanding performance. So, we\u2019ve got a basis, I think, for our confidence going forward. But, we\u2019ve been a hiring machine for 50 years. And I feel like we\u2019ll do well when we\u2019re ready to turn that back on. But, I\u2019ll look forward to that. I think that will be a high-quality problem. Operator : And the next question comes from Rick Velotta with Las Vegas Review-Journal. Rick Velotta : I hope this is a little bit of a lighter topic than some of the heavy things you\u2019ve been discussing. Does the company have any opinion on the city of Chicago\u2019s plan to enable the installation of slot machines at Midway and O\u2019Hare International Airport? And as a follow-up, does the Company have any position on legislative proposals to open Texas to legalize gambling within casino resorts in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin? Gary Kelly : Hey Rick, it\u2019s great to hear your name and hear your voice. And I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I would say, for Chicago -- and I\u2019m looking at our real estate guy here, I would say anything that lowers our operating costs at an airport, we would be all for it. I think, Las Vegas has led the way with some really innovative techniques out there, so. And beyond that, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll comment on what\u2019s going on in the state of Texas right now. But, I guess, by extension, anything that generates more travel, I bet everybody in this room would be all for it. So, good to hear from you, Rick. Operator : And we have time for one more question, and that comes from Jay Singh with Simple Flying. Jay Singh : I just want to go back a little bit to your MAX comments earlier. So, it seems like you have an appetite for expansion, and you got an order book out until 2031. What\u2019s the argument against taking maybe a MAX 9 or MAX 10 and freeing up some smaller jets for expansion when you\u2019ve got a pretty significant backlog with a lot of flexibility? Thank you. Tom Nealon : Well, I think the downside for us taking a MAX 9 or 10 is it doesn\u2019t fit our network. We have seen -- our network is built around point-to-point. We don\u2019t want to have too many connections and you start getting to a 9 or 10, you\u2019re quickly into 200 passenger aircraft, that\u2019s just too big part of network the way we run our business. Gary Kelly : Yes. I think, we\u2019d rather see Boeing. If that\u2019s our challenge, we like the 8. We like the 7 as well as we like the 8. We\u2019re -- we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not certain what mix of those model numbers will have in the future. But, just as a rule of thumb, call it, 50-50, 60-40, who cares. But if that is the issue, I think we\u2019d be pressing Boeing to increase their production rates. And again, that would be a high-quality problem. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any other questions, our communications team is standing by, 214-792-4847 of course, through our media website, www.swamedia.com. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Chad and thank you all for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share some brief remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And you will hear from our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Executive Vice President and Incoming CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; President, Tom Nealon; and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. We also have a few other senior executives with us for Q&A, including Andrew Watterson, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. We will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And we also had several special items in our first quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks. So, please see our press release from this morning and our website for more information on both topics our cautionary statement and a lot of helpful information about our results and trends. And before we get started, I want to let you all know that we are planning an investor event in December and I will send out more information soon, so stay tuned for that. So, Gary, over to you. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan and good morning, everybody and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We are obviously very delighted at the turnaround in our business from the previous four quarters of billion dollar losses and our revenues nearly doubled in the second quarter from first quarter levels and that was on a capacity bump of 44%. Our revenues were much stronger than we had been forecasting just 90 days ago, and all of that of course flowed through to better margins and better cash. Yesterday\u2019s cash was over $17 billion and that\u2019s plus $1 billion line of credit, well in excess of our $11.4 billion of debt. So, while our bookings and revenue trends are even better than the month of June and certainly better than the second quarter as a whole, we are very well prepared to manage and muddle our way through if the Delta variant affects our business. And so far, we are not detecting any impact at all, again very strong bookings and revenue trends in the third quarter. So right now, I am very pleased with all of that, very pleased with our revenue, our July business and the outlook for the rest of the quarter. This has been a long struggle to get to this point, profitability in the month of June. The pandemic of course turned everybody\u2019s world upside down and it\u2019s still not completely right side up, but I must thank our employees once again for their heroic and very hard work. Normal summer demand is always a challenge to manage and it\u2019s of course even more so here in 2021, especially in June when we had technology issues and bad weather combined, it made it very difficult. Things are much better in July, still not where I want us to be, but we will continue to improve and I am very confident that we will adjust as necessary and if necessary. So, our immediate focus is on running a very high quality on-time airline and then gradually restoring our traditional efficiencies that are attendant with our low fare point-to-point high utilization business model. And given the revenue recovery, obviously, our next focus is to sustain our profitability that we have achieved here in June and maintain stability going forward. Next year, we plan to resume new aircraft deliveries, with the desire to restore our route network as needed to pre-pandemic levels. And clearly, the network restoration will depend upon travel demand, which may in turn depend upon the state of the pandemic. So worst case, we will reduce our growth and early retire our oldest aircraft, which will be accretive to earnings with the trade-out with the MAX. So, we are very well positioned and very well prepared to manage pretty much any scenario here in the next couple of years. So, things aren\u2019t back to normal yet, but clearly, they have stabilized and are much improved and we are at a point now where we can actually plan and work on managing and spend less time on surviving the intensive care unit. And then finally, I did want to congratulate and welcome Bob Jordan. He will be our next CEO come February 1 of next year and the reception so far has been terrific. The transition work is well underway. Bob is very busy and he may comment on that, but it\u2019s going very, very well. Very proud of Bob. He is going to do a terrific job. And I am going to hang around to support our team in anyway that I can. So with that, Bob, let me just turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : Alright, Gary. Hey, thank you and good morning everybody. It\u2019s really good to be with you today and I am looking forward to reconnecting with many of you over the next few months as I begin to attend more Investor Relations activities. I am going to make just a few brief remarks. But I am just \u2013 as Gary said, I am just super excited for the opportunities to serve Southwest as the next CEO beginning in February. And I am very glad that Gary will continue to serve as Executive Chair. Many of you know Gary has been my mentor and friend for over three decades. And the two of us, along with Tom and Mike, are already working very hard to ensure that the transition will be a smooth and orderly one. Since the announcement on June 23, I have had the chance to visit and talk with hundreds of our employees around the company. As an example, I was at \u2013 got to spend the day in Atlanta yesterday with our wonderful team there. And I am just amazed by their spirit, their enthusiasm, their heart for each other and for our customers, and I am just energized by being with them. I am also focused on continuing to work with our leadership as we continue to lead through the pandemic recovery. And as we start to work on our 2022 planning efforts as we evaluate the post-pandemic environment and the many, many opportunities that are ahead of us here at Southwest. I have been part of the strategy here as we develop our strategy each year and I am very confident about our purpose and vision and where we are headed. And I will be very purposeful in how we plan for the next several years. Our strategy is sound. We are a low-fare low-cost growth airline that prides ourself in terrific customer service and being a great place to work for our employees. That business model and our people have been the enduring strength for 50 years now and we have enjoyed unparalleled success in the airline industry. We now have the nation\u2019s most robust point-to-point network and we have at least a decade\u2019s worth of attractive growth opportunities in front of us with the Boeing 737. Our customer and brand rankings remained really high year after year and our commitment to transparency continues with no bag fees and no change fees. We are committed to that. We have opportunities in the pipeline to continue enhancing the customer experience as just one example and that will be a focus, along with our commitments to both diversity and leadership and in the workplace and to environmental sustainability. We will remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position and our investment grade balance sheet. As always, we will balance our commercial opportunities, our operational flexibility and reliability and/or financial performance. You know we want new itineraries for our customers. We want growth opportunities and job security for our employees. And we want to create significant value and returns for our shareholders. That formula has worked so well for Southwest for decades and I expect that it will be and continue to be what works for us for decades to come. We have a very deep bench of terrific leaders here at Southwest, that are ready to lead for the future. And as a team, we are all very aligned on the future of Southwest Airlines. But I want to say, above all, it\u2019s our people that bring our vision and our purpose to life every single day and I am just honored to serve them and to support them on a daily basis. And with that, I will turn it over to you, Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob and hello everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter, or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving revenue trends, the primary driver of our GAAP profit for the quarter was the $724 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salaries, wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and our usual hedge-related special items, our non-GAAP net loss was $206 million, or a $0.35 loss per diluted share. Second quarter operating revenues, non-fuel operating costs, fuel costs and available seat miles were all within our most recent guidance ranges. And I am pleased with our overall financial performance in second quarter. With the strong pent-up summer demand and a solid cost performance, June marked a key milestone as we generated both average daily core cash flow and profits as we had hoped. This is our first monthly profit since February 2020 when soon after the negative financial impact of the pandemic began to impact our results and this is excluding the benefits of PSP proceeds, which is more reflective of our base business. These second quarter results, though not where we need to be, represent a significant recovery for our business and are a testament to our amazing employees who are simply the best in the industry and make us proud each and everyday. And by all indications, it appears that we outperformed the industry again in second quarter. We provided a lot of color in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends. I will just add that our trips flown are estimated to be down 11% in third quarter compared to third quarter 2019. And as such, we have several cost categories that are expected to continue to trend lower than 2019 levels such as maintenance expense, advertising expense, technology expenses and passenger and personnel-related expenses. These cost categories are expected to ramp up as trips and passengers increase and as we resume a more normal investment agenda moving forward. We are mindful of the tight job market as well as general inflationary pressures. We expect to have wage rate inflation beyond our normal annual wage rate increases as we want to be competitive to retain and attract talent. Including the decision to increase the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour across all workgroups, we now estimate $5 million to $10 million of additional salary, wages and benefits cost pressure in third quarter and approximately $15 million in fourth quarter. We are also mindful of bottlenecks, shortages and ramp up inconsistencies across the travel industry as we restart after more than a year of little activity and we are not immune. That said, we will continue our focus on ramping up costs, along with flight activity as efficiently as possible, while being nimble to adjust and add where needed. We are hopeful to generate net income again in third and fourth quarters on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And our ability to do so will largely be dependent on the revenue environment, which Tom will cover in a minute. But based on our current revenue outlook and even with the additional cost pressures we noted, our third quarter bottom line outlook is over $200 million better than it was back in April. We have flight schedules currently out through early January and we will continue evaluating growth opportunities and fleet and capacity decisions to construct the most efficient route network for 2022, being mindful that our network has evolved from what it was pre-pandemic. With leisure travel levels where they are today, it is easy to forget that less than 6 months ago the environment was drastically different. Over the past year, we were most focused on raising capital and building liquidity, minimizing significant cash burn and drastically cutting capacity and cost. And the changes that we made to our network are producing the revenue we had hoped or even better than hoped and we are now evolving our focus areas. First, we are focused on managing through the current environment with adequate resources to deliver a reliable operation. We then need to optimize our cost profile with our route network in 2022. And beyond that, we will be focused on producing sustainable levels of profitabilities, margins and returns. We plan to continue managing the business closer in at least for the remainder of this year, but we have begun the 2022 planning process at a very high level. Although I don\u2019t have any specifics to share with you today, I can reaffirm that we have tremendous flexibility, perhaps the most flexibility we have ever had going into any year in my nearly 30 years at Southwest. We have flexibility with our cost efficient Boeing order book with a significant number of MAX options remaining in 2022. We have flexibility in terms of where to deploy our aircraft in the network and how much capacity to fly in 2022. And we have a strong cash balance, modest debt requirements and discretion over how quickly we want to resume non-aircraft investments in 2022. So, we have flexibility with our capital. And aside from our people, our biggest core strength is our balance sheet and financial preparedness even coming out of this pandemic. So, with that, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Nealon : Okay. Well, thank you Tammy. Good morning, everybody. While our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations, we saw improving monthly trends throughout the quarter in both leisure demand and yields and we also saw a steady improvement in business demand, which I will talk about in just a minute. And we are also pleased to see broad-based improvement across the entire network. So, this was not concentrated improvement in certain regions or cities, but it really was across the entire system, which was terrific to see. June\u2019s leisure passenger traffic was actually higher than June 2019 levels and June\u2019s passenger fares were in line with June 2019 levels, very much as we expected. And we also saw significant improvement in business travel revenues as well, improving from down 77% in May to down 69% in June versus 2019. And just keep in mind that on our Q1 call, we reported that our business revenues were down 88%, so throughout the second quarter, we saw a very steady sequential improvement in business travel from the first quarter. And just as you know, when I talk about business revenue, I am really referring to managed business travel. In terms of third quarter trends, we are continuing to see strong leisure travel throughout the summer. And as I said, June\u2019s leisure traffic performance exceeded 2019 numbers and we are seeing that strength continue into July. In fact, we are estimating that both leisure traffic and fares will trend higher in July relative to 2019 based on the trends that we have seen so far. And we are also seeing continued improvements in close-in demand and yields for business travel as well. So in total, that results in an improving July revenue outlook of down 10% to 15% versus 2019. In our earnings release, we also introduced our August revenue outlook of down 12% to 17% versus 2019 and we are estimating that August has a 1 to 2 point headwind compared to August of last year and this is simply due to the calendar shift that pushes all of Labor Day into September. I think that when you adjust for the calendar shift, we are pleased with the way the booking curve was shaping up for the month and demand and fares are also shaping up really nicely for August. And this is very consistent with our expectations as we move from our highest leisure demand month, which is July, by the way, into August. Now, with respect to business travel, the recovery path is less clear, but it\u2019s also clearly improving. So, if you look back to Q1 and then to every month in Q2, we have seen consistent sequential improvements over the past 6 months. So we are encouraged by what we are seeing and we are expecting a continuation of steady weekly improvements in business bookings. It\u2019s also very clear that more and more companies are returning to the office. You are seeing that, we are seeing that. And without doubt, we are also seeing that corporate travel restrictions are beginning to be relaxed or removed altogether, which is great to see. And as you would expect, we are doing plenty of our own surveys with our travel management company partners and our business customers, so we are talking with them frequently, we are talking with them directly. And we are very encouraged by what we are hearing from them, but we are also probably more encouraged actually by what we are seeing in terms of travel activity. So, business volumes and fares were both down in the second quarter, but both showed improvement in April, May and June and we are expecting sequential improvements in Q3 as well, though we do expect overall yields will continue to be pressured in the third quarter versus 2019. Our booking curve rather for business, as you know, was naturally closer in, so now it\u2019s mostly about improving volumes as the booking window tightens up. And I will say that and I will just reiterate what Gary said, the guidance that we are giving today doesn\u2019t include any impact from the Delta variant. What I will say is though we have not seen any impact on the Delta variant at this point, so our outlook is based on trends that we are currently seeing, all of which by the way are very encouraging. Just a quick comment or two on our Rapid Rewards and ancillary business, we had a great quarter. We saw another strong performance in Q2 in both our Rapid Rewards loyalty program as well as in our Chase co-brand credit card program. And we have more Rapid Reward members today than we did in Q2 of 2019. And June was actually the highest new member acquisition month in the history of the program, which was terrific to see. And our co-brand credit card program is larger now than it was pre-pandemic and retail sales for second quarter were up nearly double-digits versus 2019 and the spend per card also beat Q2 of 2019 levels. So, as you can imagine, we continue to be very, very pleased with the strength and performance of our loyalty and card programs. Our ancillary revenue trends, such as upgraded boarding and EarlyBird, also performed extraordinarily well in the second quarter, which is what we expect to see as load factors improve to historic levels. Just a quick comment on our GDS initiatives, which continue to rollout and as you know, we\u2019ve already gone live with Travelport and Amadeus and we will be going live on Sabre on July 26, which is this coming Monday. This is a big accomplishment. It\u2019s been a tremendous amount of work, it\u2019s a big deal and creates a big opportunity for us and this does complete the implementation phase of our industry standard GDS works. So, we now have a full array of distribution channels, which gives our business customers a channel of choice, whether it\u2019s a GDS platform or a Direct Connect/API channel or our Swabiz self-service platform. So without a doubt, our Southwest business team is pretty energized. They are pretty jazzed up. They have a great product to sell. We are in the right channels and they are really focused on driving new business. And now that the barrier is removed, there is a big opportunity for us to win more business, both from existing customers, which by the way, we have a lot of under-indexed as well as new customers and this is a tough sell for us before moving to industry standard GDS platforms. So, I think we are in a great position. We have a great business product. We have a great value. As of Monday, we will be in all the managed travel distribution channels. We have a great sales team. So I am looking forward to all the products we are going to make here. Just a quick comment on the network, Tammy alluded to it, but before I wrap up, I just want to talk about that for a second to give just a bit of perspective, I am sure we will get into it in Q&A. And as you have seen, we have made some pretty meaningful changes in additions to our network as soon as the pandemic began 14, 15 months ago. And over the past year, we have announced service to 18 new airports. And at this point, 15 of the 18 are now up and running. And all the new markets are either performing within our expectations or ahead of our expectations and each one is a very strong, very natural addition to our network that we have wanted to do for quite some period of time. And as you know, new stations have a development curve and we understand that and we get that. And we are very pleased with where these stations are at this point. They will have the time to develop. And as I said, all of them are meeting or exceeding our expectations. And we also have the objective and again, Tammy alluded to this, of restoring many of our pre-pandemic routes and O&D frequencies while also maturing in new markets. So in terms of aircraft investments, our 18 new airports represent nearly 100 nonstop markets and over 280 new trips per day. And by the end of the year, they will utilize roughly 55 aircrafts. And with our recent additions to Hawaii, which really is the culmination of the original plan, which is suspended because of the pandemic, we are at 37 trips per day from the Mainland U.S. to Hawaii, with nearly 40 inter-island trips per day and that utilizes roughly 37 aircraft. So we have committed substantial amounts of aircraft to new city opportunities and to Hawaii and both investments are paying off and meeting our expectations. It was the right decision. Our Boeing order book gives us a tremendous amount of optionality and that allows us to fund our current network investments, while also allowing us to pursue the planned restoration of our network, all of which we will be working through in our 2022 planning process that Tammy just alluded to. So I will tell you, I think that we are very, very well positioned for the future. And with that, I am going to turn it over to my friend, Mike, to talk about the operation. Mike Van de Ven : Well, hi, thanks, Tom and welcome, everyone. From an operational perspective, I would say this is a pivotal quarter for us. We moved from, I would describe, managing and moderating our operation in the first quarter to really an acceleration focused in the second quarter. If you would compare just March to June, those 2 months, we added about 650 additional daily trips, so that\u2019s a 25% increase. And then our customer and bag volumes far surpassed that. They were up nearly double that with a 45% increase between those 2 months. And that is just a monumental increase and it\u2019s \u2013 we have done in a short period of time. And inside an airport environment that I would say is really still adapting and everything in that environment seems to take a bit more time today. Our travel mix as you know has been reported as primarily leisure, so our pre-check customers from a TSA perspective were down over 10% from \u2013 as compared to June 2019. If you go out to the airport restaurants, lot of them have reduced hours or staffing levels, so there are longer lines. The third-party providers for wheelchair services have been able to scale with customer demand. The hotel shuttle services are less frequent. And of course, the airport is one of the last experiences across the country, where masks are required throughout the travel day. And considering all that, that\u2019s just a tough environment to live in everyday and I am tremendously proud of our employees. They continue to answer the call and they really are Southwest warriors. And in fact, they produced a very solid second quarter operation. So in the midst of that increasing customer volume, we also launched service to 7 new cities. We rolled out our new maintenance IT system. We launched Hawaii service from Las Vegas and Los Angeles and Phoenix. We expanded our existing Hawaii service. And we accomplished of all that while delivering an on-time performance of 76.3% and that was right in line with our 2017 through 2019 results pre-COVID. The bag handling remained exceptional. It was our best quarterly performance outside of last year\u2019s second quarter when travel demand was really low. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT for all the marketing carriers. So just \u2013 again, I am just very, very proud of our employees. Now, June was our most difficult month of the quarter. Our April and May outperformed previous years in all of our key operational metrics. And even with the customer volume increase, June was off to a solid start. Mid-month, we did run into a combination of technology issues, followed by weaker weather challenges across our entire network. And those introduced some extreme delays into the network and it caused significant crew availability concerns as well as delays and cancellations that impacted our customers and that dropped our OTP to 62.4% for June. And we need to and we will do better than that moving forward. As we moved through July, weather is still a bit of a concern as is the overall tempo of the airport environment. But the entire industry is feeling the impact of those things and that\u2019s reflected in the overall industry OTP thus far in July. We expect our operational reliability to continually improve from our June performance. We use planning models that require an adequate level of airplanes and people and facilities to run our schedules. As we entered into the second quarter, we had all those resources aligned and we were on track until roughly mid-June. And so there are a couple of focus areas for the operation as we move forward. First, the passenger demand is very strong and our load factors going in and out of our large cities are 90% plus most days and we are still ramping up the operation and we have 16 fewer flights than we did in June of 2019, which for us means there are fewer ways to re-accommodate customers when we have delays or cancellations, while higher volumes and fewer re-accommodation options translate for us into a longer operating day. So we are adding staffing in several of our large cities to have additional resources to cover those longer operating days and reduce the need for a premium pay. We have increased our minimum starting pay to $15 an hour to better source applicants for those positions. And we are offering premium pay for our employees to pickup open shifts on their scheduled time-off just in the meantime. The second thing that we are focused on is sourcing flight instructors, so we can ensure that we can support the training needs for our pilots returning from extended time-off as well as our recurrent training needs as we continue to add flying to the network throughout this year and then set ourselves up for 2022. It feels really good to finally be in a position where we can add flights and pickup our operating momentum. It was a bit messy as we have throttled down our activity and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that it\u2019s a bit messy as we are accelerating it. But our employees have navigated those \u2013 through those things heroically. They have great hearts for our customers and for each other. And I am just so proud and thankful for their efforts everyday. And with that, Ryan, I think I will turn it back over to you. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Mike. Chad, we will turn it over to you to give instructions on how to queue up for analyst questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hey, everybody. Thanks for getting me on. I think there is probably a couple for Tammy but I am not sure. So first one is where are you right now on average daily utilization and when do you plan on getting back to 2019 levels? Tammy Romo : Yes. Yes, I can take that. So we are \u2013 our utilization is currently around 11 hours per day roughly. And in terms of just getting back, we are working through our schedule as we look into 2022. So we are hoping to get back more in line with levels in 2019, but we are not too terribly far off either. Obviously, a lot of that will just continue to be based on demand and as Tom took you through largely a function of how quickly we see corporate demand returning. Gary Kelly : We still have what, 39 airplanes in storage as well. Tammy Romo : Yes, absolutely. Gary Kelly : So if you look at the total fleet, Hunter, in addition just to what\u2019s scheduled, we still have some slush in there, which we will try to wring out with future schedules, obviously correlating with what Mike was describing, which is making sure we have the proper resources to support the additional flight activity. Hunter Keay : I got you. And then sort of in the same vein on that, I know you said you are going to continue to evaluate the 44 options. Given the ESG benefit you highlighted, is it fair to assume that the bar is very high for you not to exercise those, meaning whether it\u2019s COVID-related or whatever, things would probably get a lot worse for you not to exercise those options? Is that a fair default way to think about it? Tammy Romo : I think that it\u2019s absolutely fair. As pointed out, we have a very cost efficient Boeing order book. Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet with ample cash. And we can \u2013 there is a strong ROI on those options either way. And obviously, we are hoping we can continue to grow the airline here, but if not, it\u2019s compelling business case for us to retire the older -700. So, I think that is a fair assumption. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe just sort of the question on corporate, I think you said that your June corporate was down 69% and that\u2019s a pretty nice step up from where it was a couple of months before that. I think some of the legacy peers are down a little bit less than that. So I am just wondering if that\u2019s kind of normal given your mix of business and kind of how do you see that trending over the next several months, given that you are now complete with all your GDS integration? Thanks. Tom Nealon : Well, so this is Tom. What we are seeing is I think we are seeing something very similar actually to what I am hearing and reading from the other carriers as they report. But just to give you some context roughly, call it, 30% of our passengers or so are business travelers and probably 35% of our revenues is generated by business travel. And I think that the opportunity for us, I think this kind of gets to your point or the answer to your question, we have a lot more opportunity to drive a lot more depth within the current accounts we have with GDS. So, I think that you will see that begin to drive up our Southwest business numbers, if you will. But very consistently, we are seeing about 5 points of improvement in Southwest business bookings each month over the past 4 or 5 months. We said, I guess this was the first quarter call, Ryan, we said that we \u2013 our expectation was Southwest business or business travel will be down about 50% by year end. If you just kind of extrapolate where we are right now, we would beat that. I think our expectation would probably be at 50% by the end of this quarter and certainly beat that by the end of the year, assuming things keep going. So I am not sure if we are behind our competitors or not, to be honest with you. I feel like going from down 88% to down 69% on the path towards down 50% by the end of the quarter is pretty much in line with the market. But I think we are going to see more and more penetration with the GDS implementations and again, we just under-indexed significantly in these big accounts. So that\u2019s an opportunity for us. Gary Kelly : So I am not going to say anything different than what Tom said, so it\u2019s probably unnecessary for me to say anything. But just to offer you my own opinion, which is we are using the corporate accounts that we know as a proxy. And so our total business travel is far beyond this proxy. And I think one could assume that they are smaller companies, maybe sole proprietors or what have you. But our frequent flyer credits and there are just other inputs that we look at it would suggest that, that is a conservative number. So, I agree with Tom. We are the largest airline in the country. We carry more people than any other airline. I think we carry more business travelers than any other airline. So, I find it hard to believe that we are inconsistent with anybody else. But admittedly, we hear the same numbers that you hear and we just can\u2019t \u2013 when out surveying people, we can\u2019t be for sure what their purpose of travel is. But our frequent flyers, those flight credits are down far less than 69%, which is some indication. Of course, it could be a businessperson who is traveling for personal reasons. We just don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably more information than you wanted, but I can\u2019t imagine that we are out of step with anybody else in the industry. Ravi Shanker : No, that\u2019s great color and then that makes a lot of sense. Maybe a follow-up for Tammy, kind of just given some of the labor issues that are hitting virtually every industry and every company out there, maybe you can talk about kind of what Southwest is seeing on the ground and maybe some of the initiatives that you guys are taking to make sure that you guys are fully staffed for back half of the year? Thank you. Tammy Romo : Yes. I will chime in there and Mike may want to chime in as well. But yes, we are \u2013 so couple of things. As I already mentioned, we are increasing salaries across our system, the minimum wage there, so I think that will certainly be helpful. We are \u2013 and just to kind of step back, we are actually staffed appropriately coming into the quarter. Now, there are some locations where we are wanting to boost our hiring and we will continue our efforts there. And then as we also mentioned, we have recalled our employees that were on the voluntary leave programs and we will recall all of those employees by the end of third quarter, certainly by the end of the year. So, Southwest is known as one of the best employers in America, so we don\u2019t anticipate any issues there on the hiring front. So, we will \u2013 as we ramp up capacity here, make those decisions, we will be able to hire the employees that we need, but those are few of the things that we are doing. Mike anything that you wanted to add to that? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. No, I don\u2019t have much. I would say that across the network, we are appropriately staffed. We have got pockets where we need more people. We have got pockets where we have too many people. One of the great things that we can do and that we are doing is we can incent people temporarily to go fill in where we are short. So we are doing that in our large locations. And as Tammy mentioned, we have a handful of our large locations where we had very aggressive recruiting efforts going on. And as Tammy mentioned, with our $15 minimum pay increase, we have really good pay packages with our union contracts out there. And we feel like we will be able to get those people as we ramp up the network. Gary Kelly : And we have just gotten back into the game. So, I don\u2019t know when you started trying to recruit and hire Mike, but it can\u2019t be that [indiscernible]. It is more challenging. So we acknowledge that. And I am worried about it, but I agree with Tammy and Mike moved \u2013 the minimum is up to $15 an hour, which will certainly help. But pilots, flight attendants, we are not sensing that we are going to have any problem there. I think it\u2019s more just hiring in our ground operations where there is just a lot of competition or that pool of potential employees as well. Mike Van de Ven : It\u2019s interesting, too, the staffing challenges, a lot of times that we find ourselves padding our problems. It\u2019s the industry. It\u2019s everything around the industry, whether its van drivers or maid services to clean hotel rooms or people to work at restaurants. And it just makes that entire environment difficult for our employees or customers to navigate through. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Stephen Trent from Citi. Please go ahead. Stephen Trent : Hi, good afternoon everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just a very quick one from me. Any sense whether, not just you guys, but any sense whether you think the industry might need to step up its IT spend post pandemic, not only in terms of facilitating customer interface, but also considering cybersecurity. You have this a few months ago, the Southeast pipeline incident. I had two or three people tell me today that your website happen to be down. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but I would just love to hear your thoughts. Tom Nealon : Well, I guess I will take that one. This is Tom. I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think we are all struggling, not just airlines, but I think every company is struggling trying to figure out where to invest its cybersecurity dollars, what elements are the most exposed, where is the biggest risk, how do you defend against that. And it\u2019s kind of a moving target, but that is a real source of focus. I know \u2013 I am sure it is for our competitors as well. It certainly is for me in my role. And so we are spending a lot of time on cybersecurity. I think that the \u2013 I think that\u2019s the primary thing. I think that this is a network that is so technology-dependent and so network-dependent that I think that\u2019s an area of investment that everyone is probably investing more in. But I think beyond that, I think every company has their own business strategy and their own set of technology requirements for that. But the big common thing, I think, is just the cybersecurity investment spend is very important, it\u2019s very real and it\u2019s significant and it\u2019s hard. Gary Kelly : Just to pile on to Tom\u2019s comment and actually, I am stealing his words, but we are very technology-dependent as an industry and it\u2019s probably stating the obvious. But that does suggest that we need to be top drawer when it comes to our technology. And obviously, the cyber risk everyone is aware of, and it is sort of a bottomless pit when it kind of comes down to how much does one need to do. But not really trying to speak for the industry, I am just talking for us. But absolutely, we view ourselves as a technology company. We have an excellent team. We have ample dollars allocated for that effort. And one thing that the pandemic has done for us is it\u2019s made us a lot more efficient with our technology investment and management. And it\u2019s enabled a lot within the workforce as well. So, I feel like we are better than ever at Southwest, and you can be sure that we are going to continue to make that a high strategic focus. Tom Nealon : Gary, if you don\u2019t mind, since you just said we view ourselves as a technology company and an airline and service company, but we just did have an outage. So, I think rather than wait for a question on it or not address, let me tell you how we feel about that and what happened. So just to be really clear, we did have a technology outage, which was pretty impactful. In fact, we really hindered Mike in the operation in a very significant way. And yes, just... Mike Van de Ven : Back in June. Tom Nealon : Yes, back in June. And it really clogged things up and just made for a very rough situation. And I just want you guys know that first of all, it was not a cybersecurity issue. It was not a hardware failure. It was not an engineering failure or architecture issue. It was a human error. And it\u2019s just something that was a mistake made and we are dealing with it. But it was not a structural issue or investment level issue. It was just a simple human error. And we feel terrible about that. We got to be better than that, especially if you are going to be so dependent upon technology, you can\u2019t have mistakes like that. But this was not a failure of technology, if you will, it was a human mistake. So, we will do better. But I just wanted to get that out before the question was asked. Bob Jordan : Stephen, you mentioned one \u2013 this is Bob, customer experience, investment just an example of IT. And I would just chime in for a second because it is kind of on my list of focus items I would like to look at for \u201822 and beyond because they are just win-win. They typically tend to be things that relatively low spend. You can put more and more decisions and transactions in the hands of our customers on mobile devices, especially when we have things like irregular operations, the ability to handle it that way, give them choices without standing in line, making a call to our wonderful CS&S employees as an example. Those are just terrific things that I would love to look at and we will look at because more and more customers and our employees expect that they will be able to manage their lives, interruptions on the mobile devices. And it\u2019s just good all the way around because the \u2013 it\u2019s good for our customers because then they can handle more and more things via self-service. And it\u2019s good for us because it moves those transactions from potentially long lines or a long phone call wait time into a much shorter handling period. So, it is a focus of something that I would like to look at is just how we can continue to take our terrific customer experience to an even greater level. Stephen Trent : That was a super helpful. Thanks very much everybody. Operator : The next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi. Thanks for the time. Question for Gary and Bob, and I am not sure if you all intended Bob to have pesky analyst questions at this point. But can you give us a sense for any differences in priorities, leadership styles or relative strengths? I appreciate you two have worked together for a long time, but maybe you could highlight some differences or previous indifferences. Gary Kelly : I think the biggest difference is that Bob is an aggie and I am not longhorn. And other than that, we are sort of joined at the hip. But Bob mentioned it in his remarks that he has been a part of this and he has been a part of it for a long, long time. 33 years is a long time. He has had a number of different executive jobs. So, I think you all should just know that he has been a part of coming up with and defining our purpose and our vision and translating that into a strategy and he has been a huge part of the execution. But at the same time, what we have got to be careful here is the task of a leader is to have the wisdom to know what to change and what not to change. And at the same time, I need to \u2013 selfishly, I need to empower him and get out of his way. So, I had a good teacher in Herb Kelleher. He was Executive Chair for me. And I wasn\u2019t necessarily thinking at the time that, \u201cOkay, well, I need to learn from this because I will do it someday.\u201d But fortunately, I have lived through that. And I do have a good idea of what I need to do to support him. But Bob, that\u2019s really more of a question for you. Bob Jordan : Yes, and we have been able to work through that whole aggie/longhorn thing. It\u2019s taken two decades of the three decades, but we got there. But no, I am just kidding. But yes, I think a couple of things. One, we \u2013 at the end of the day, as the CEO, you cannot do it all yourself. It\u2019s all about the team and we have a wonderful team of leaders here. And I think we are both very passionate about focusing on that, developing our team, developing our leaders, developing the \u201cnext generation\u201d of leaders and preparing people. And so I think that \u2013 I feel like we are very similar in that way. Yes. In the same way that Gary invested in me and many others for decades, but I think at the passion point of mind to be able to continue to do that because it\u2019s all about not just what we can do as we have this change, it\u2019s about what we can do to set Southwest Airlines up for success for 20 years and 30 years and even more years. On the style front, in addition to that, I think our styles are, again, very similar. We are very collaborative. We love bringing the team into the conversation and the decisioning. If there is a difference probably, I \u2013 and this can be good and bad, I am probably a little more of a driver, maybe a little more impatient sometimes, which is probably the way a lot of my assignments over the years have been go do things, go get the integration underway and push through completion as an example. So, that can be a benefit in terms of driving and getting things accomplished in our plan. But I also have to work on sometimes slowing down, being collaborative and just make sure we make wise decisions here as we \u2013 as of course, we will. How we would approach the plan and our strategic plan, in particular, were very similar. I think there \u2013 as you know, we are very focused on things like GDS and modernizing the fleet. Plans change though. You complete a set of things and you roll into the next set of things, and you want to be very thoughtful about what those are. We want to be, again, collaborative with our team about developing that set of next strategic initiatives. And so we will work, as part of our \u201822 planning, to think about that next set of things. I mentioned this upfront, I am focused around things that are just maybe part of what is an expectation today. So our customers expect us to work with them and engage with them and produce the customer experience that is maybe again terrific. Our employees are just terrific, but they expect a lot of things to be quick, delivered over mobile platforms, easy to resolve, even in Iraq situation. Our employees expect the same thing. They want it to be very easy to work with Southwest Airlines, manage their shifts off of their iPhone, for example. And so I will be very focused on some of those things. The other \u2013 and again, this is a focus that both Gary and myself and our whole team, I am very focused on our diversity commitments. We laid some of that out next \u2013 last year. We have things that we need to focus on. We, in particular our diversity in our senior leadership group. And so you will likely hear me talking a lot about that. As Tom mentioned, we have a lot of focus in our sustainability commitments. And so plans change over time. They always do. The initiatives we have on the table right now are what I and Gary and others were involved in 10 years ago and so they are always going to shift. But we are going to make sound judgments. We are going to develop the team. We are going to stand by the principles that make Southwest Airlines great, our business model, our people balancing our results with our operations and with our customer experience. And so maybe a long-winded answer, but I think we have \u2013 we are generally a lot of similarities in how we approach the business and the problems and our people. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate that perspective from you both. Maybe just a quick follow-up with respect to the labor availability tightness you are seeing frontline ground ops. Can you comment if that\u2019s broad-based versus specific regions? And how do you think about solving what may prove to be a transitory cost issue with permanent solutions or how do you \u2013 what\u2019s your view on sort of transitory versus sort of fixed? Thank you. Bob Jordan : Mike, you want to comment on that? Mike Van de Ven : You bet. Yes, the \u2013 and it\u2019s a complicated question because there are so many factors. I mentioned I was in Atlanta yesterday, so you could see the hiring and labor complexity firsthand there. So, I think you are \u2013 multiple things, you are in a broad-based market with supply shortages. So, there is just not enough people to fill the jobs that are open. I might \u2013 the stat that I think I have heard it, we went into the pandemic with open \u2013 a lot of open jobs here in the U.S. And I think we have had 9 million or 10 million folks exit the workforce at this point. So, we all see that the help wanted signs everywhere. So, you are competing in a market that is just tougher. As an example, we are getting fewer applications for open position than we are used to. So, it\u2019s just going to take a lot of vigor around the focus on hiring. Some of the differences are regional. I would say they are more about how to triage critical positions. So, we have places where it\u2019s more critical to the operation than others. For example, we are really \u2013 we have got a full press on to hire on the Denver ramp as an example because there are needs there. We have full \u2013 we have a full press to hire flight instructors because we have plenty of pipeline \u2013 a pipeline of pilots we feel like, but we need to get them trained. We have folks coming off of the ExTO, and it just takes time to train and get them back into the workforce. So, there needs to rebuild our training capacity just like our hiring capacity. So, I think I would tell you the \u2013 I am probably more focused on this being a broad-based problem in terms of just labor availability than a narrow issue in terms of a specific job. The biggest question to me, I think we are fighting our way through because we will get through rebuilding, recruiting teams and training teams and that short-term, those are short-term issues is, how long does this persist. Do we plan against this being a three-month issue as the folks are really going to return to the workforce, for example, once school starts or are we planning, against a multiyear issue where it\u2019s going to be folks coming back into the workforce very slowly. And that\u2019s a difficult question, which means you just have to be nimble in your planning, how we think about bringing aircraft into the schedule, which I am very pleased we have the flexibility, how you think about planning your schedules and how you think about staffing your schedules. The last thing we want to do is put a schedule out there where we cannot staff. And so there is just \u2013 there is a lot of focus on this. I will tell you, if it\u2019s not the #1 focus right now, it is 1A, which is getting \u2013 getting our hiring in place and our staffing in place. Gary Kelly : And the good news is there are techniques doing to do what Bob described and that is the philosophy that we are going with. But I am sure you glean this. I mean the effort per hire is I don\u2019t know what Bob, double what it is to be? Bob Jordan : At least double. Gary Kelly : So \u2013 and that\u2019s money and \u2013 so all of that, I think that\u2019s what Bob means in addition to just how do you plan the next schedule. But Mike, anything you want to add? Mike Van de Ven : Not much. I would just say for me in the operation, I would say that there are six to eight big locations in big cities that if I could snap my fingers and we could go add ramp agents to those locations, that\u2019s what we want to go do. I think we have got a great package to offer them. And so when we get that in front of them, I think we will be very successful at doing that. But there is \u2013 just to be transparent with you, there are also frustrations that people have to go through to get on the ramp. There are background checks. There are \u2013 is managing at airports, they are driving out to the airports. So, those are the things that we have to overcome with the compensation package, career and benefit and travel privileges. And I think we will be really successful with that, but it might take us six months or so to kind of get into the swing of things. Gary Kelly : And that\u2019s as contrasted, Mike, to like Amazon, it doesn\u2019t require near the \u2013 they don\u2019t have to and obviously we do. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just coming back to the discussions we had earlier on fleet, you have placed a couple of incremental orders for aircraft since the pandemic, including one since we last spoke last quarter. It would look like some pretty attractive economics. I am not asking for capacity guys, which I know will also be influenced by retirement, as you noted. But off of that 2019 base that was so impacted by the MAX grounding, how should we be thinking about your ability to produce ASMs based on the MAX return to service and these incremental deliveries over the next couple of years? Thanks for any color. Gary Kelly : I think the \u2013 and I am sure there are several thoughts in the room here. I think that the company \u2013 you are talking about technology and physical plant and facilities and things like that, I think the company is very well prepared to increase volume. We are very \u2013 so to me, you kind of think about it, if we want to grow, we need airplanes, we need airports, we need money and we need people. Those are sort of the four big categories. We have got \u2013 the Boeing deal, as I mentioned to you all back in the first quarter, that was a huge strategic positioning for us. I am very, very pleased with that. So check. I think the airport capacity that we have around the country is in great shape. And where it\u2019s not, for the most part, we have a line of sight to address it, number two. So, I check that one. We have got money. We \u2013 and as I was trying to share with you all in my introductory remarks, we have more money right now than I thought we would three months ago or six months ago. So, I am feeling really good about the balance sheet and our liquidity. And I think you are down to what we have been talking about the last 15 minutes, which is people resources and that, I think, will be our constraint. So, I hope that answers your question, but I will just open it up. Tom Nealon : I think the thing I would add \u2013 and Catherine, this is Tom. The thing I would add is assuming you can get past the people constrained piece of it in terms of how we want using the capacity. And by the way, I think back to Hunter\u2019s question, it seems to me we would take those aircraft, because we want to retire, you still are going to retire. Its NPV positive kind of stuff, you have a better customer experience that all works. So, I don\u2019t think there is a fear or concern of us taking too much aircraft and being stuck, right. So, we have plenty of flexibility, the ability to retire, the ability to retain and keep growing. But I guess what I am really getting at is our ability to produce good ASMs and productive ASMs are going to be somewhat impacted is largely dependent upon when does business traffic begin to come back, and let me explain, why. The composition of our network, our point-to-point network, it\u2019s our principal around the point-to-point network has not changed with the pandemic. How that\u2019s been executed for the past year, it\u2019s been shifted a little bit just by virtue of the environment. But our philosophy is the same. So, we do want to get back to the pre-pandemic mix of direct versus connecting flights, call it, 75-25 historically. We are a little bit skewed off of that\u2019s probably, I don\u2019t know, Andrew, 72-28 or something like that. So, we want to get that back. We also want to get back to our mix of short, medium and long haul flying, call it, rough terms 40-40-20, short, medium, long as percent. And right now, it\u2019s more like 30-40-30, because those short-haul flights, those are the business-driven flights. And the business traffic wasn\u2019t there. We need to create the leisure capacity. It came from short haul. So, as the business comes back, you will begin to see us just reinstate that kind of flying. So, there are many, many productive uses of the capacity. And again, the capacity \u2013 if the demand does not show up, we have the ability to retire 737, 700s, right, and just continue to improve the fleet. So, I think we have got in fact, either Mike said this or Tammy said this or we have all said this, the flexibility we have on the upside and the downside is really positive. It\u2019s really strong. Gary Kelly : I think the redeployment and you all checked me on this, but the redeployment is to try to go back to where we were in 2015. That\u2019s 15% of our route system, as I recall. That we have reallocated from call it more business-oriented markets, i.e., short to the longer, more leisure oriented. So, I think that speaks somewhat to what you are describing. But \u2013 the other thing I would comment on 2019, in 2019, we were close to providing the network that we wanted, because we were constrained in that scenario by the fleet. And so we are already trying to get back to where we were plus. And all of this is, as we have all said, it\u2019s all dependent upon demand materializing like we are thinking. But yes, I think we have got a great opportunity. And as long as we can get it, I think at this point, the people, we will be able to deliver. Catherine O\u2019Brien: That\u2019s great. Thank you for the color. And I think Gary someone needs for retirement present to get you that recipe for capacity growth on a pillar or something. That was great. I like that. If I could just maybe sneak one more modeling type question shorter term in, looking through the monthly revenue forecast, we see August step down a little bit from July. I think there is some holiday movement in there, as you mentioned, and perhaps second half of August is a little bit more back-to-school given you are kind of South and Southeast part of your network. If that\u2019s right on the return to school, driving a little bit less leisure demand, while corporate is still depressed, would it follow that September should also see a sequential step-down in performance versus August or are there other factors at play? Thank you so much for the time. Tom Nealon : Well, you are asking good questions. So I think that the \u2013 first of all, I think that the calendar shift from two points from August and September is just that it\u2019s a calendar shift. It doesn\u2019t really belie the underlying strength of the business. So, August is performing well. So, I am not concerned about August. There are no red flags in August, but it does have the natural seasonality. The first half is strong leisure. The second half is back-to-school, and that\u2019s where the business traveling begins to kick in and pick up the slack and that kind of thing. So, we are waiting to see that. We feel pretty good about that. In terms of September, we did something this year that was really creative. So, I am kind of smiling at Andrew right now because he and his team sorted this out and worked through it. But we had a 50th anniversary sale that was really all about driving leisure demand in the back half of September. September, call it, second week of September through November 3rd, some such date, but it\u2019s basically trying to fill in upfront the leisure bookings early to secure a nice solid foundation book of business. And from that point forward throughout the rest of September and October, you are able to begin to manage just the remaining booking window, if you will. So, that has worked really well. In fact, the 50th anniversary sale, the three day sale. I think two days of the three days, Andrew, worked two of the top in fact #1 and #2 in terms of our history over 50 years of bookings, right. So, this thing really worked. Point being, we have a very solid foundation of leisure bookings in place for September. I am very curious to see what\u2019s going to happen with business travel post Labor Day. Everything we are sensing, feeling, hearing is suggesting that you are going to see it begin to come back. What I am really encouraged by is, I got to be quick, I am taking too much time, on the top 50 or so corporate travel accounts, seven are professional services consulting firms, they are all traveling. The lockdowns are removed. So, they are traveling, and that\u2019s a big deal for us, and that just begins to generate more and more. So, I think it\u2019s beginning to pick up some steam. So, I am nonplussed by the August issue you raised. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue. September, we have built a good solid book of leisure, and I feel good about where we are. Tammy Romo : Yes. And Tom, the only other thought that I will just tag on really quickly is we have got some exciting things happening in just a few days as we turn on Sabre. So obviously, there is going to be a ramp-up, but we are super excited about that. And we think we are uniquely positioned in that regard with respect to corporate business travel. So, a lot to look forward to. We are really excited about it. And as I think Gary and Tom have already alluded to, is you shouldn\u2019t read anything different into our September forecast versus what you are hearing like some of our competitors. We are \u2013 we are just \u2013 we are coming out of a pandemic. It\u2019s as simple as that, but we feel really good about where we are headed. Gary Kelly : Yes. And we have just continued our sort of pandemic rhythm here of providing 60 days outlook \u2013 but we are not \u2013 we don\u2019t see anything that suggests that September is going to drop off. So, I think that\u2019s just to make sure that, that comes through. We are reluctant to provide a forecast yet because it\u2019s just far enough out. But the August is just the timing of the holiday is all that is. Operator : The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Just a question on the cost side, if I might ask again, if I pick-up the hopefully, what our shorter term rebuild near-term pressures. It looks like unit costs are flat to down 4% or so versus 2019. And capacity being back to 2019 levels, I was just wondering if this is a fair base level. And I ask this because I know in 3Q \u201819, I think there was about seven points of pressure from the MAX-related grounding. So, I was just curious how we should think about what we \u2013 what\u2019s been achieved in terms of getting costs out? Tammy Romo : Yes. Savi, I can start, and I am sure others will want to chime in here as well. But just to take you through our thought process here. As we laid out for you in the release, absent the operational cost impact that we called out, our third quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit sharing would be forecast to trend in line or below 2019 unit cost levels. So, while most of these near-term cost pressures should be one-time or non-recurring as we move beyond this ramp-up period, we have always really considered getting back to 2019 unit cost levels at sort of a point in time target. And we have shared that sentiment with you, I know before. As far as the cost base in 2019, we were hearing extra employees, as you pointed out, due to the MAX grounding. However, when you think about that, the nominal cost of that was really overshadowed by the seven points of capacity that we were unable to fly back in 2019 that caused the outsized inflation. So, if you fast forward to where we are today, we have a lower overall headcount due to voluntary retirements, but just keep in mind, we have had 2 years of right inflation for our employees. And as we have already covered with you, we have recalled the vast majority of those employees from extended time off. The recall will help us, of course, as we continue adding trips here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but it does reduce the benefit from our voluntary leave program by about $50 million in both third quarter as well as fourth quarter. And the other thing to consider is that we are now back to 2019 levels and we are building toward 2019 trip levels, as I pointed out earlier. So just \u2013 so we will have some noise here as we have already covered with you all. It\u2019s just not as clean as we would like as we are adding back in capacity. And we will need to do some hiring as we have already covered with you all for our work \u2013 for many of our work groups to support that true growth in the second half and as we restore our network next year. But what I really wanted to get to is as we get back to restoring our network and we kind of get in a rhythm here, we should have more operating leverage as we bring back on more capacity. So, I think that\u2019s a really key point for you all. We are just \u2013 it\u2019s just a little messy here. But that is obviously our goal. Our goal is to scale as efficiently as we can as we restore our network. So, I think, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. We are going to be really focused on our productivity metrics like employees for aircraft, and we are going to all work together just to be as efficient as we can and really go back to more of our history of having very highly productive employees and that will be anchored around our point-to-point network and our all Boeing 737 fleet. So, I feel like our competitive cost advantages are very much intact, and we are going to work really hard to make sure that we scale efficiently and offset inflationary pressures, which is not unique to Southwest as best we can. Gary Kelly : Yes, really, Savi, I think Tammy\u2019s last point is the important one which is our \u2013 we want to strive at hissing with Hunter\u2019s initial question about aircraft productivity to schedule efficiency, and that will be somewhat dependent upon demand and how many flights we can put in. But 2018, 2019, coming into 2020, we had great momentum running the operation. We had great plans to improve the turn times and improve our efficiency, and we have not yet had a chance to test those out. I am very excited about that opportunity. So, I think that\u2019s really key and that its guess work is to when we are going to have the opportunity to actually do that. We will need more airplanes. We need more flights. We \u2013 all the things that we have been talking about all morning here, so. Savi Syth : To make sure I understood that. And if I kind of \u2013 there is a lot of moving parts, clearly, but more of a realistic way to think about a sustainable level and there will be inflation beyond that. But maybe getting to slightly below 2019, is there a realistic view on once things have normalized? Gary Kelly : Well, I would be shooting from the hip to answer that question. I think we can be \u2013 I could be thoughtful in answering that. Tammy may already know the answer, but 2019 was not optimized either. And as you have pointed out, I think the question is if it were, what would that benchmark be. And how realistic is that given the inflation, so... Tammy Romo : Yes, I agree, Gary. And Savi, just we are not ready to provide fourth quarter guidance, and we will be meeting later this year, and we will be more prepared at that point to lay out our plan for 2022. But I will try to just provide you just a couple points, just to give you a little color. We do \u2013 just to be clear, though, we do expect the current cost inflation and salary wages and benefits from our operational strain to be temporary. And here in the near-term, we anticipate some ongoing cost pressures and other cost categories as we ramp up our flying and that\u2019s obviously like maintenance, airport and other operating costs. So there will be some costs that come back on as we add capacity as we recover. And then there will be some choppiness, too, as we bring back our flying. Just looking ahead to fourth quarter, as an example, our maintenance cost will be burdened more in fourth quarter due to just bringing the 700s that Gary mentioned out of storage and back into service. And we\u2019re realizing airport cost pressures as well. And then the inflation we\u2019ve already covered. So again, I think it really goes back to as we scale up, we will have more operating leverage and we will \u2013 I think the key here is to get back to those 2019 productivity levels. So, again, a lot of moving parts. And as we get through the year, have more visibly into next year we will be prepared to give you all a better guidance there. Savi Syth : Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question, and we will take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thank you very much operator for squeezing me and thank you, guys. So I have two questions. One is, you talked about the level of credit card acquisitions in, I guess, the June quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if you can say what you attribute that to? Why you\u2019re seeing such a strong recovery in that area versus maybe what you would have expected pre-pandemic? Tom Nealon : Yes. Well, it\u2019s pretty simple, actually when we have a lot more people traveling, so you have the opportunity to get them to sign up. We also marketed it really hard. We had a very 60,000 point offer out there, sign-up offer and with more people being out there, it\u2019s just that much more feeling, I guess, or it\u2019s easier to get more people to sign up, but it\u2019s also just a great card. I mean, it\u2019s part of the Rapid Rewards program, which is an incredible program. There is no blackout dates. The points never expire and on and on. It\u2019s just a very, very valuable card in the form of currency and is performing extraordinarily well. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get into the Chase performance numbers, but man, we are performing very, very well. So I think obviously just people being out there traveling again and being able to acquire and we have marketed this pretty hard. Gary Kelly : Yes. Tom Nealon : Yes. They are out, they want to spend money. Gary Kelly : I think that\u2019s right. Tom Nealon : Get a credit card. We\u2019ve been very pleased with that. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s great. Yes. No. And then the other question is you talked about environmental issues and culture and diversity and things like that. And I thought you\u2019ve got it pretty good and the company has had a pretty good track record. Tammy isn\u2019t the first CFO, that\u2019s the female and Colleen Barrett back in the day was President. So you have had a really good track record of supporting, I think, all of checking all this box as a young, still efficient fleet and diversity at every level. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering what you\u2019re thinking the are two things. What you need what you think you need to do to maybe get more credit for it? And then second, how we should measure you against it? Gary Kelly : Bob, do you want it? Bob Jordan : Yes, Helane, I think it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right. We have \u2013 I think we have a really good track record. And what you saw for us last year, we came out with commitments that were really around diversity in particular, racial diversity in our senior leadership group. So I think what you find is that as you look at our broad employee base, we are very diverse. So particularly on the front line, I think I would \u2013 my guess would be that our diversity in our overall workforce, particularly the front line for the most part matches what you would see here in the United States. I think we\u2019re in really good shape there. But as you move sort of up the leadership chain here, and again, I\u2019m thinking about our senior leadership, it is hard to argue that we don\u2019t have some work to do. While we have terrific leaders, we have a terrific pipeline of leaders, and it\u2019s really just about making sure that as we think about our succession planning and our long-term pipelines that those are diverse. We \u2013 our hiring practices focus on thinking about diversity as a component where do we recruit, how do we think about hiring and how we choose to hire. And then, again, because if you just took our senior leadership group as an example, where we do have some work to do, I would argue, and that was part of our goal stated last year. It\u2019s a long succession pipeline to move from a kind of an entry-level leadership position, ultimately into a senior leadership position. That may be a decade-long process. So it\u2019s very focused on, to be honest, the processes we use to think about how we hire and how we recruit and where we hire now and where we recruit. And then how we think about just improving our diversity in senior leadership. And then again, that depends on the pipeline. We\u2019re looking at things just classic sponsorship and mentorship programs, which we all do. And so again, I wouldn\u2019t take that as, we have a big issue. I think we \u2013 historically, you\u2019re right. We have, I think, produced really good results, but there is improvement that we think we need to focus on there. Helane Becker : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Bob Jordan : You are welcome. I am looking forward to being with you at the conference here in a month or so, by the way. Helane Becker : Thanks. Looking forward to it, as well. Ryan Martinez : Alright. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our Q&A. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, please give our Investor Relations team a call. Thanks so much, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President People and Communications. Linda Rutherford : Chad, thank you very much. We will get underway with our media Q&A. If you\u2019ll go ahead and give them some instructions to queue up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering, I guess, with the benefit of hindsight, if there is anything you would do differently in planning for this summer or any additional sort of coordination that there might have been between kind of the network side and the operations side. Just as you look back, if you had the opportunity to kind of replan the summer all over again, if you would do anything differently? Gary Kelly : Well, Alison, I\u2019ll take that one. The \u2013 only with the benefit of hindsight, by the way, because the schedule was very well planned. It was very well coordinated between our financial objectives, our commercial opportunity and our operational capabilities. It was very well planned. It was planned based on our historic modeling of what kind of resources we need for what kind of activity, which we have 50 years of experience doing. And we included some cushion, for lack of a better word. So turn times as an example were actually planned to be higher than what we would otherwise expect. And in hindsight, there are some elements of our plan that were too tight. That being one of them at some of our locations. If you were listening to the analyst call, Mike mentioned his eight largest airports. So weather, I/we factored in weather as best we could, and the weather was more spring-like in June, in particular, than normal. And so that kind of whacked us. That\u2019s out of our controlled technology or one-off things. And those are the two headline issues for June. If we get into July, I think we\u2019re in the middle pack most days, Mike. So we\u2019re not first in the industry. We\u2019re not last. So the industry is simply operating slower. And I think we want to be \u2013 we can see some elements of where that\u2019s manifesting and what we do know is we have a different network than 2 years ago. We have a much higher proportion of consumers traveling that has translated into much heavier baggage loads and also buying itineraries that are complex, i.e., connecting, which also translates into more connecting bags. So we can see things today that we would not have known, when we put the schedule into effect. I can assure you, we will be factoring that in prospectively. So that\u2019s the one very tangible thing that I\u2019ve seen so far. And again, you\u2019ve got experts in the room here that may want to chime in. But the overall allegation that we were understaffed is not true. That is incorrect, meaning that it wasn\u2019t understaffing that\u2019s led to delays. The problem becomes \u2013 the delays, whatever the reason for is puts pressure on the staffing, because the days are longer or as Mike was describing, how flight crews end up diverted in the wrong place and out a position and so do airplanes. So getting the airline back on the tracks obviously is job one. But our people have done a phenomenal job. They are working very hard. Mark \u2013 Mike described some of the challenges in the environment. It\u2019s just \u2013 I blame it on the pandemic. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s messy coming in. It\u2019s certainly messy coming. Anything you guys want to add? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll throw something in here, Alison. So our point-to-point network is it\u2019s a different model than most other airlines out. And the way that we are able to absorb significant events in that kind of a model is we would generally cancel a flight, get the airline back on time and then we would reaccommodate customers through other alternatives that we had. And we do that very successfully year in and year out. The biggest change that I think we faced this year with 2020 hindsight is we can\u2019t absorb those significant events as efficiently this year as we did in the past, because we don\u2019t have as much frequency in our network today that we did yesterday, but we will in the future. And so what that is causing us to do is to run those flights a little bit later, and it extends the operating day. And so that\u2019s really the crux of the issue. And then the solve for that is as we grow the network and add flights back, that solves itself. And then also, we\u2019re going to come into a period of time where we don\u2019t have the thunderstorms and these pop-up weather events that we do here in June and July. So I feel like the worst part of all that is behind us. And given all the information that we had, as Gary said, we were planned appropriately well, just not able to absorb those significant events like we could in the past. Saying all of that, we\u2019re roughly in the middle of the pack in terms of dealing with those things today. Gary Kelly : And Alison and I agree with Mike\u2019s point on our network, but even having said that, we have no problem with this new network until mid-June. No problem whatsoever. We had great on-time performance all the way through May. So, yes, I will admit to you, and I take full responsibility for it. I was surprised \u2013 I wasn\u2019t surprised that the impact of the technology outages had, but it took quite an effort to work our way through the second half of June and the weather events. And we\u2019re closer to normal here in July, although we\u2019re not satisfied with where we are. But long answer to your question, but it is complicated. I will say that, and it\u2019s been 24/7, because it\u2019s not obviously the customer service that we want to offer our customers. But I think the worst \u2013 clearly the worst of it is behind us in June. Alison Sider : Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Operator : And the next question will come from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you have any updates on steps that you\u2019re taking to address unruly passengers and better equip crew to deal with bad behavior in flight? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. So Tracy, this is Mike. So our flight attendants, they have training on handling passenger disruptions and just how to deescalate events, and we have recurrent training with respect to that. And I think that they do a very, very good job with that. As you mentioned, there has been a marked increase in, what I would say, are abusive customer behaviors, and that\u2019s throughout the whole industry. And I know that it\u2019s a small subset of travelers to be sure. But we haven\u2019t experienced these kinds of violent outbreaks before. And I can understand from a customer\u2019s perspective, maybe how some of that frustration builds up. But we have no tolerance for customers to take out that frustration on our people or anyone else for that matter and especially if those are in physically threatening or assaulting manners. And so we try to be as hospitable as we can as part of our operating philosophy day in and day out. But we do have a responsibility to inform customers of the federal mask mandate. And we do participate in the enforcement of that mask mandate by reporting abusive and threatening behaviors to authorities. We have been very vocal with our unions about having these authorities follow-up and be as aggressive as they can on these abusive customers. And in addition to that, we will add customers to our restricted travel list if they are abusing our employees. Tracy Rucinski : Will you make self-defense classes mandatory for flight attendants? Mike Van de Ven : We have different defense mechanism \u2013 defense classes that we \u2013 defense techniques that we talk \u2013 that are already part of our recurrent training in our flight classes. Tracy Rucinski : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead. Leslie Josephs : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering what your expectations are for labor costs in the next few years, especially as you start renegotiating some contracts with some of the groups? Mike Van de Ven : Leslie, I think we have a \u2013 there is been a lull in 2019 and \u2013 2020 and 2021 getting through this pandemic. But I think as the economy recovers and the business in the United States grows back up to what everybody thinks that they are going to be. I think we will have the same type of labor pressures going forward than we did in the past. And generally, those are wage rating increases or scale increases that are along the line of inflation or GDP growth. And I think we will have those going forward. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Gary Kelly : Yes. I think the important thing to note, and Mike said it, I\u2019ll just restate it a little bit different way is we\u2019re coming off of $5 billion worth of losses. And we lost money again here in the second quarter. We are hoping to make money in the third quarter. So in that kind of environment, you kind of question the wisdom of increasing costs further. And I think our point is real simple, which is, no, we want to take care of our people. We want to continue to reward them. They have gotten us through this pandemic. They have got us set up for prosperity once again as we work our way out of this. And we\u2019re certainly looking forward to concluding negotiations where we can reward our people going forward. The exact amount, which \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you were driving for that, the exact amount, certainly for our contract in always is negotiated, and we wouldn\u2019t speak to that. But the main thing is we want to get those done, so we can reward our employees. Leslie Josephs : Okay. And in the near-term, are you seeing any benefit or near and medium-term to having more junior employees join. I know the floor is higher now, but maybe lower rates than some of the senior people that left? Gary Kelly : Yes, there is always \u2013 the growth is always helped because of that average wage rate effect. So yes, as we\u2019re hiring, which is an element of growth, whether we actually literally grow or not, we were hiring people we will get some benefit there. But that does \u2013 that\u2019s not really a driving \u2013 that\u2019s not a strategic or even much of a tactical objective of ours. That\u2019s just the arithmetic of the way that works out. I don\u2019t know, Tammy, if you have \u2013 off the top of your head, what that effect might be? But just remember that for over a year, we weren\u2019t hiring anybody. I was going the other way. So we\u2019re just now getting back into the hiring mode, and I couldn\u2019t tell you how many people we\u2019ve actually hired here recently, but it\u2019s not that many. Tammy Romo : Yes. No, not much to add there, Gary. That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re just now really gelling up the hiring machine. But just in terms of the contracts that we have with our employees, we always \u2013 while we\u2019re low cost, we don\u2019t achieve those certainly on the backs of our employees. And just looking here at the current year, we would estimate rate increases in a couple of hundred million dollars for the full year this year just based on the current contractual increases. So it\u2019s not like wages are standing still. There our rates embedded in the contract, which is what Mike was referring to as the step increases. And so that is call it a couple of hundred million that I was referring to. Gary Kelly : Yes, our employees that are not under union contract, they got merit increases last year. They will get them \u2013 they had them this year, and we\u2019re having promotions and promotional increases. So we\u2019re \u2013 I think our folks are doing a good job of taking care of our people. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from David Koenig with the Associated Press. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Yes. Hi, good afternoon everybody. As a follow-up to Alison Sider\u2019s question, you mentioned in the release and Tammy mentioned it here, that you\u2019re going to save less money than you had previously expected, because you\u2019re calling people back from leave a little earlier than you had thought. So I wondered do you feel now like you waited too long before recalling people and did that contribute to what\u2019s happened over the summer? Gary Kelly : No. David, we recalled everybody, I think, probably in the March, April time frame. We have about 400 pilots left on ExTO, and they are coming back to the company here between October and March but we \u2013 before the summer started, we had all of our people recalled. Bob Jordan : Well, we have nearly \u2013 yes, we have nearly everybody back here in the next month or so. I mean the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I feel like we began to recall because we know the schedule far in advance. Gary Kelly : Far in advance. And we know our training capacity far in advance. So all of that \u2013 the output of that is how many flights can you fly, right? And so, no, there is no implication at all that we needed to read that we should have recalled people earlier. David Koenig : Okay, thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from David Slotnick with The Points Guy. Please go ahead. David Slotnick : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m just wondering about the Delta variant. It sounds from everything that we\u2019ve been hearing over the last 2 weeks, like it hasn\u2019t been affecting bookings and the airlines aren\u2019t really seeing any consequence from that yet. What I\u2019m wondering is what red flags are you looking out for? What signs are you looking at for that there is damage if that ends up happening? Mike Van de Ven : Well, I guess, transactionally, we\u2019re just looking at bookings straight up. Are the bookings coming in or not? So that\u2019s kind of real time, but prospectively, we\u2019re looking back in trying to understand what is the customer sentiment and our customers are beginning to be less willing to travel or not, because of Delta variant. And to be honest with you, we have not seen that. It is very, very modestly, but almost statistically insignificant, to be honest with you. So we\u2019re looking at the customer sentiment, but we\u2019re also certainly looking at current bookings as well as forward bookings and the trends are the trends, and they are still solid trends. So we really have not seen it. If we did, we\u2019d share that with you, but we are just not seeing at this point any issue or any impact from the Delta variant. Gary Kelly : And I think further to that, our folks try to stay very well informed. And we\u2019re aware like you are that the case counts have ticked up where we\u2019re \u2013 locally at least we\u2019re hearing predictions that the cases will rise significantly in the fall. I hope not, but we\u2019re reading that too. But it\u2019s not just the airline activity, you look more broadly, and there is no indication anywhere that I see that activity is being diminished because of the increase in the case counts, so far, so good. I\u2019m worried about it. Just like your question implies. And I think what I\u2019ve tried to share is that we\u2019ve got to be very nimble and very flexible here. And we are very well prepared. If things do soften up, we\u2019re ready, and we will adjust accordingly. Bob Jordan : And I think the last thing is watching all the data that Gary mentioned. The big question is also where \u2013 I think we all feel like it\u2019s the getting the vaccines out there and the vaccine efficacy is what drove the surge in demand and bookings starting in maybe late February and then the surge in demand here in the summer. The question would be, is the Delta variant or whatever variant comes in the future, somehow changing the efficacy of the vaccines. And there is no \u2013 as far as I know, there is no evidence of that. I mean the story is go get vaccinated, because if you were vaccinating, it\u2019s working. I think in the Town Hall that President Biden had yesterday, the report was that of all the recent deaths and all of this is unfortunate, I think 99.5% of the folks were not vaccinated. So I think we\u2019re also looking at is somehow the variant changing the efficacy of the vaccine, and so far, it is not. David Slotnick : Appreciate the insight. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. Allie asked the gist of my question about the operations, but I do have a couple of follow-ups on that front as, although it\u2019s a question on the mask mandate. Bob, you mentioned in your remarks, you were talking about fewer flights to reaccommodate people. I broke down the number 16. Did you mean 16%? Or could you \u2013 what\u2019s that statistic? Bob Jordan : It was percent. Yes. Dawn Gilbertson : Percent, okay. And then also\u2026 Gary Kelly : I heard the same thing you did. And you just left off percent. Bob Jordan : I\u2019m sorry. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay, because I know it wasn\u2019t 16th year. And then your... Gary Kelly : It was actually Mike, but that\u2019s okay. Dawn Gilbertson : Sorry, I meant, yes, sir. And then on-time performance, what is it so far in July? You said at the middle of the pack. And basically, I guess the question is when can travelers expect \u2013 I know you said the worst is behind you, but when can travelers expect you guys to get back to normal operationally or at least to your standards operationally? Mike Van de Ven : Well, it\u2019s 67 month-to-date here in July at this point in time May 14th. And that\u2019s let say, 67%. That means they were arriving within 14 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. We\u2019re closer in the 80s there if you just expand that to the 30 minutes. So I think from a customer perspective, we\u2019re still offering a decent experience. It\u2019s not what we want, because it\u2019s taking them a little bit longer to get to the destinations than what we would like them to. I think that as some of these weather events and these thunderstorms, disappear here in the August and September time frame. And then I think just the natural trends are for our load factors to tailor off just a bit. That will give us more recovery options than we have today. And so I expect this to be better here or better in July than we were in June. I think we will be better in August than we were in July. And hopefully, here by the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will be back to where we wanted to be. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. And then the follow-up question, I don\u2019t know if this is for Gary or Bob, who wants. On the mask mandate, the September 13 expiration date, do you expect that to be lifted or extended? And what is your stance on that? Thank you. Gary Kelly : Well, I\u2019ll take that one. That\u2019s \u2013 well, that\u2019s a political question to a degree. So I don\u2019t know whether the mandate will be extended or not. What we have been consistently advocating is that we follow the CDC guidelines, which is if you are vaccinated, there is no mask required. And if you are not vaccinated, then you should wear the mask. And unless that changes from the CDC, we wouldn\u2019t advocate from a Southwest perspective or the A4A for that matter, extending the mask mandate. You\u2019ve got the Delta variant now that is somewhat new information at this point. So I\u2019m sure that is being very carefully thought through and studied. But I\u2019m not aware of any effort underway to extend the mask mandate. And we \u2013 at least at this \u2013 as of today, we\u2019re not advocating an extension. Dawn Gilbertson : Thanks very much Gary. Operator : We have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi, I wanted to go back to the issue of the unruly passengers just real quickly and ask would Southwest advocate for more of those passengers to face criminal prosecutions versus civil penalties? And do you think that would have any impact on the level of disruptions? Gary Kelly : Well Mary, I just \u2013 I have a hard time tolerating in passenger that physically abuses our employees. That feels criminal to me. And I think that is criminal. Mike Van de Ven : If it\u2019s a criminal activity that ought to have criminal prosecution. Gary Kelly : And so there are extreme cases out there that is occurring. And I think that we would be for whatever the full enforcement in letter of the law, whatever is available, we would be in support of that. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay, thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you so much, Chad. Thank you all for joining us today. If you have follow-up questions, you can reach out to our communications team, and you know that we\u2019re always on at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Just a few quick notes here. So first we will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from those expectations. And second, we had a few special items that are first-quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference our non-GAAP results in our remarks today. So please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information on both topics. And just a reminder that we are hosting our Investor Day in New York on December the 8th so stays tuned for more details on that, and we will go ahead and get started. So, Gary, over to you. Gary Kelly : Ryan. Thank you, very much and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. After five quarters of pandemic weakness, we saw a dramatic recovery in terms of passengers, fares, and revenues. And obviously, that was very encouraging. It would've been even better, but for the delta variant surge, which began to affect us in early August, of course, the balance and revenues came with a lot of bumps in the operation though, as our historic staffing models left us short and caused us to miss our reliability plan for the quarter. And that required immediate attention and action for future schedules, which we have taken. So, I would be the first to admit that things are messy. It is also very encouraging to see the earnings potential, and especially considering the business travel as far from recovered to 2019 levels and our capacity is not fully restored with 24 airplanes are still sitting on the ground. It also illustrates that this virus and its effect on our business can be unpredictable and volatile. And the burden to manage through all of this falls to our people. And we've gone from not enough to do to too much to do in a very short period of time. And as a perspective, of course, I think we'd all take the latter scenario any day. It has been a huge challenge for our people, so I want to thank them. They are warriors. They have performed exceptionally well and especially considering the challenging circumstances, I am very proud of them and they remain and always will be my top priority. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our incoming CEO, Mr. Bob Jordan, who will give us a quick overview. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Gary, and hello everybody. It's good to be with you again. I'll touch on a few items before I turn it over to Tammy. The transition continues to go really well. As part of the leadership changes announced last month, our full senior team now reports to me and they are the finest leaders in the industry and it's an honor to work with them. We are working together on long-term priorities and specific plans for '22 and we will share those in December. But one of my highest priorities is being with our people and it's energizing to see their heart, and their dedication, and witness the incredible job that they do every single day despite the challenging operating environment. They are my heroes and it's an honor to stand beside them as we emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of our opportunities. As Gary said, we had terrific momentum at the beginning of the third quarter, especially leisure demand with traffic actually above 2019 levels. We were on a good trend on the corporate side as well as it was just off of a lower bottom. The resurging COVID cases cost the quarter about 300 million and that aside, the quarter would have been solidly profitable. As cases have come down on subsided booking trends have recovered nicely on both the leisure and the business front, and booking trends for the holidays are in line with 2019. As you know from the release, the key headwind for the fourth quarter, aside from just inefficiencies, as we continue to ramp up as a significant increase in jet fuel prices. I do want to touch on the issues we experienced beginning October 8th. Our challenges started with a widespread ATC ground stop and ground delay program that effectively shut down our Florida operation from that afternoon through the end of the day. Mike is going to talk more about this, but that caused a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position, and then that took several days to recover. As a result, we inconvenienced thousands of customers, and we further challenged our stellar employees. And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees, we just did not live up to your expectations. Before this, we were actually seeing very positive trends in our operational performance. And the key to continue improvement is getting staffed and continuing to invest in our operation, and we are absolutely laser-focused on both of those. Looking forward, our media goals are really basic. One, bulk up our staffing. We made tremendous progress that remains short of what is needed, especially when we dip in the staffing reserves. And therefore, we've continued to modestly tram our fourth and first quarter schedules. Two, get back to our historic operational reliability and efficiency. The ramp up of the business and the fits and starts caused by the COVID waves have made both of those very tough, as has the lack of network there. Three, restore our customer service advantage, which starts with our people and the unrivaled hospitality that they deliver. And again, that is tough in the current operating environment. And fourth, continued that focus on our people and our culture. Our people are our advantage and the last 20 months has been challenging them collectively and individually. Our culture has sustained us through the pandemic and it will power our advantage as we emerge from the pandemic. And while we have short-term issues to manage, I will just tell you, I'm very positive about our long-term opportunities. I'd also like to talk briefly and highlight our sustainability plans. Earlier this week, we announced a set of specific 10-year plans in support of our overall goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. It's important to our people, our customers, and above all, our planet that we're good stewards. As we grow over the next decade, that growth is planned with no incremental carbon emissions as compared to 2019. And carbon emissions per available seat mile falling by at least 20% by 2030 as compared to 2019. This progress occurs through a number of initiatives, but namely a commitment to the more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 8, and accelerated retirements of our older, less fuel-efficient aircraft; a commitment to 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, and in the near-term, a carbon offset program that partners with our customers who are passionate about this and our offset program will be the only one that provides both loyalty points and a dollar-for-dollar match. Above all, I'm just really proud of the work team that has done the work to pull this plan together so quickly. And I'm especially proud that our plan and our commitments are specific and they're time bound. To wrap up, while we've made considerable progress from a year ago and are pleased with the recent improvement in travel demand trends, it is clear that 2022 will be another transition year in the pandemic recovery. The restoration of the network is a top priority in '22 and '23, but it will take time and it will be largely dependent on the pace of recovery of business travel and our ability to staff. Even with the anticipated cost headwinds in '22 related to significant inflation and productivity shortfalls, our primary goals next year are to deliver increased operational reliability, generate solid profits and margins, and restore and grow the route network, while reducing our carbon emissions intensity. And I look forward to sharing a lot more about all this and our \u201822 plans at our Investor Day on December the eight. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy, Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello everyone. I'll provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $446 million profit in third quarter, or $0.73 per diluted share, and this was driven by the $763 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salary, wages, and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and other smaller special items, our net loss was $135 million, or a $0.23 loss per diluted share. Our third quarter results are clearly not where we need them to be, and we are disappointed by this step-back in revenue trends as a result of the Delta variant. Even so, we are pleased our bottom-line came in above expectations, and improved sequentially from second quarter. And we currently have $16.2 billion of cash in short-term investments on our balance sheet. This is well in excess of our outstanding debt, and it is relatively in line with where we were at the time of July earnings before the impact of the Delta variant began. Overall, travel demand has proven to be more resilient today and the overall impact of this variant has been much less than what we previously experienced since the pandemic began. Before I get into the specifics, I want to offer my thanks and appreciation to our employees. Their employer spirits have been in full effect since the pandemic began and I commend them for continuing to work together to combat this pandemic. I am also pleased for them that we were able to accrue additional profit sharing in third quarter as a result of our GAAP profits. Third quarter, available seat miles and non-fuel unit costs were within our guidance ranges, and I am pleased with our overall cost control throughout the quarter. Operating revenues were better than guidance, and that was primarily due to improving revenue and booking trends in the second half of September, soon after our last investor update as COVID-19 cases began to decline. And fuel cost per gallon was slightly better than guidance. We provided a lot of color for you in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends, as well as fleet plans, so I will just add a few additional thoughts. We had four points of notable cost pressure in third quarter. And these four points were primarily due to premium pay, as well as other ramp up costs. In terms of premium pay going forward, we currently anticipate that we will need less in fourth quarter as we have reduced our flight scheduled to provide more staffing cushion, reduction in premium pay provides a roughly two-points unit cost tailwind from third to fourth quarter. Our 2 largest ongoing inflationary cost categories are salary, wages and benefits, and airport costs. These 2 categories alone are driving 3 points to 4 points of unit cost inflation in fourth quarter on a year-over-2-year basis. First on salary, wages, and benefits, which represents roughly 3 points of the unit cost pressure, we have higher-than-normal wage rate inflation, including the recent increase in the minimum hourly wage. It is the tight labor market, which is also putting pressure on wages. In addition, we should have nearly everyone back from extended leave by year-end, and we are hiring across all work groups to support the current operation. Second, on airport costs, by year-end we will have 18 new airports in our network, so our overall properties footprint has increased and we are experiencing rate pressure across the board. The rate increases we are anticipating continue to be much higher than inflation, especially in this environment. Our fourth-quarter trips are expected to be down 13% compared with fourth quarter 2019, which underutilizes our space and exacerbates the inflation we're currently seeing. I expect better operating leverage from our airport facilities in the future as we are able to add depth and frequency back to our network over the next few years. Also, in fourth quarter, we have 4 to 5 points of notable cost pressure above and beyond general inflation. These cost pressures are attributable to hiring, our vaccination incentive pay program, and lower productivity than historical norm. We expect cost pressures from lower productivity to persist in the near-term, and subside as we are able to restore the majority of the network. Even with these inflationary pressures, our fourth quarter bottom-line outlook is trending better than third quarter, except for higher fuel prices. Fuel prices, even after factoring in higher hedging gains, are $0.26 higher in fourth quarter than in third quarter, which is roughly 120 million more in fuel expense sequentially. That said, our strong fuel hedge is currently expected to provide $0.18 of hedging gains here in fourth quarter and underlying revenue trends have ticked up, which is encouraging even though we are expecting a loss for fourth quarter in this high fuel price environment. Our flight schedules are currently published through April 24. We have reduced our fourth quarter capacity to down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And we currently expect our first quarter 2022 capacity to be down 6% compared with first quarter 2019. We currently have 72 firm orders and 42 options next year, and we will continue to evaluate option exercises as decision points arise. Regardless of our capacity plans next year, we continue to believe that taking the additional 2022 options will yield a positive net present value on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As far as other commentary on 2022, we will share more about our fleet and capacity plans and our financial outlook at Investor Day and I'm looking forward to seeing you all there. So, with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. To some of our third quarter revenue performance, it was disappointing to take a step back on the revenue recovery trends we experienced from March through July. The impact of the Delta variant began impacting revenues around the beginning of August, and we saw slowing and inconsistent pass-through traffic and bookings along with an increase in trip cancellations through about mid-September. In terms of overall revenue loss, September bore the brunt of the impact and we saw that across all geographies in for both leisure and business travel. As with prior waves, when we have a step-down in demand, especially with the slide we saw in business demand September, yields are tough to manage. However, we had better success in terms of maintained load factors in the low 80% range for the third quarter. The silver lining is that the overall impact for the Delta variant estimated to be 300 million in Q3, another a 100 million in Q4, was less severe than what we experienced from prior COVID waves. As you may recall, operating revenue stalled down in the mid negative 60% range from September through February. So, travel demand is much more resilient today than this time last year. While there's a lingering impact to fourth quarter operating revenues from the Delta variant, revenue trends have improved substantially since mid-September. Trip cancellations have decreased and stabilized, and we've seen an increase in bookings across all geographies for both leisure and business. Operating revenues are currently expected to improve sequentially throughout the fourth quarter. The booking curve has normalized, and bookings thus far, for the holidays in November, December are healthy and supported by improving leisure demand. In fact, our overall booking curve is currently trending in line with 2019 levels for the holidays, which is encouraging. In terms of business travel trends, our managed business revenues were down the lower 60% range in both July and August year-over-2-year, but took a step back in September to down 73%. Over this trend has reversed as we are experiencing steady improvements in business bookings thus far in October. Based on current trends, we expect managed business revenues to continue improving modestly. in November and December and end at down roughly 60% by year-end. This estimate is less optimistic than what we previously shared prior to the impact from the Delta variant, as many corporations pushed back our campus openings until after the New Year. But we remain cautiously optimistic about overall business travel improvement throughout year-end and we believe there is some pent-up business demand, and there's a chance that we see a pick up at a faster climb as we get into early 2022, We are now live on all three of our plan GDS platforms; Amadeus, Travelport, and Sabre. We have now removed the friction from businesses working with Southwest, and we have a full array of distribution channels that they can choose from. Early indications from our GDS launch are we are gaining incremental volumes through the GDS channel and seeing a great response for Southwest fares through the GDS. As expected, we're also seeing some channel shift from our direct connect channels to GDS, which is perfectly okay and sets us up for broader fuel to corporations to the channel of their choice. Turning to our new markets, they continue look well and overall performed in line with expectations in third quarter. Hawaii markets were impacted more severely as travel warnings were issued against travel to the islands. However, all of these growth markets have shown improvement recently in line with the broad-based improvement we're seeing across the rest of the network. And lastly, our Rapid Rewards program continued to show progress in third quarter with other revenues up 10% on a year-to-year basis. We remain convinced about the growth opportunities of Rapid Rewards and our program portfolio, which we recently expanded in terms of our credit card offerings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Van De Ven : Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally and it's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services like wheelchairs and concessions, mass requirements for customers and our people, and we still have a very challenging supply chain and hiring environment; and all of those things are impacting you travel experience for our customers and for our employees. Our third quarter operational results reflect that environment and we have a number of employees making significant sacrifices to help us navigate through it, and I am extremely grateful to them for their support to engage in a very difficult arena. And they're just special warriors. We finished the quarter with a 71.7% on-time performance, and while that was 6th in the industry, those delays were generally less than 45 minutes, and our on-time performance at 60 minutes was 90.4%, which was 4th in the industry. We did have our best third quarter bank handling performance in our history with, of course, the exception of last year when our bag volumes were slightly less than half of this year. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. So, while I'm not satisfied with our overall results, and we can, and we will do better, our people worked very, very hard to take care of our customers. As we move forward, we are focused on a couple of targeted actions. First, we know that our on-time performance has been impacted all summer by a combination of high load factors, and especially going into an out of our largest cities and a reduction in frequencies from our typical network. In fact, our largest cities experience full airplanes coming in and out nearly every day, and they had much more extensive connecting activities, including bag volumes than what we had seen pre - COVID. And those activities took more time to complete, then we had scheduled for our turns. And given the heavy load factors, we tended to hold the flights for connections, given the reduction in frequencies and our inability to reaccommodate the customers. And that of course, put pressure on our on-time performance. And that averaged roughly 66% from July through mid-August. So as the customer volumes declined mid-August through September, and those activities lessened, our on-time performance improved to 80%. And that was a welcome improvement, but again, it was below our historical performance in that period. So, in the near-term, we have focused hiring efforts to increase staffing at the airports to give us more resources to handle those activities when our load factors increase over the holiday periods, and we're also better using our staffing tools to more accurately match our scheduled shift with those activities. So, I expect both those additional resources and more focused stacking execution will boost our on-time performance going forward. And then for future schedules, we are looking at scheduling opportunities to move ground times around the places where it's most needed to keep our flatlines on time as long as this connection activity is expected. In a second -- in a separate but still related issue from on-time performance is balancing our schedule with our crew resources. All of our employees should expect to be able to bid their shifts, to show up to work, and it'd be the same as what they did, and then they get to go home as planned. And I've mentioned before that those staffing plans were based on various models that have assumptions in them for things like vacation and sick leave, open time, or shift pick-up rates, and the time that takes to fill open positions. And while we had adjusted those assumptions going into the summer to provide more staffing cushion, they just weren't enough to match the reality of the environment that we were operating through. And that was particularly impactful to our flight crews. Our sick trends were much higher than expected, and our open time pick up rates were also impacted. And those were more pronounced on weekends, and we were routinely exhausting our reserves to cover those impacted slides. And that's what causes accrued reroute and the unplanned overtime and the unscheduled overnight, and all of that impacts our people. So, it's a spiral that we just have to break. And to do that, we've adjusted our fourth quarter flight schedules downward as previously announced, and we have a new hire flight attendants along with pilots returning from extended leaves that are coming back online in the fourth quarter. And those actions will boost our crew reserves to 20% for our pilots and around 26% for our flight attendants. We'll also expect our SEC trends, which include COVID impacts, to begin to decline as this Delta variant begins to wane. In summary, we continue to add staffing and we've made schedule adjustments to both improve our on-time performance and add more staffing cushion to navigate through our current environment. As our environment and our staffing and scheduling balance begin to stabilize, we'll be in a good position to begin restoring our network frequencies during 2022. In closing, we've had our share of operational headwinds this year, I know the environment is full of stressors and distractions, and I just want to express my continued thanks to all of those employees that have made significant sacrifices to take care of our customers and to support their cohorts. I know they have tremendous pride in our Company and the Company is tremendously proud of them. And with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back to you. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up. And just a reminder to please keep your questions to 1 and a follow-up if needed. So, Rocco, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : Yes, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Jamie Baker, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Good afternoon, everybody. Gary, notwithstanding the PSP -related prohibition, could you opine on the milestones you hope to achieve before dividends and buybacks reemerge as part of the Southwest story? Gary Kelly : Well, I think, Jamie, it's pretty much a stock answer. Obviously the -- we'll want to make sure that the earnings support that. We'll want to make sure that the balance sheet supports that. And then we'll want to balance that against our capital plans. So, I think the litmus test that we've used for decades, we would continue to use. In the old days, when we were so high growth, we had a fairly modest dividend and used share repurchases sparingly because we were investing in the Company and in growth. I think everybody in this room is very hopeful that that's what we've got in front of us. I think we're -- I pushed a little too hard there in the third quarter with capacity, but the encouraging thing is demand is there. We've got a line of sight to airplanes, thanks to what I mentioned in the second quarter, we've got airport capacity, and right now our constraint is just making sure that we have the people resources to balance all that. So that's going to be a priority, repairing the balance sheet at least to a degree, Tammy is nodding her head here, is certainly an objective for us, and you got two levers, one is paying down debt, the other one is generating earnings, so both of those work in tandem. But it will -- I think our long history of returning or having returns to shareholders, it has not changed. It'll just have to obviously feather in with this very different environment than we're finding ourselves in and an interesting growth opportunity over the next 5 years. So, Bob, I don't know if you're -- or Tammy, if there's anything you'd like to add? Tammy Romo : No. I think you've covered it all, Gary. Jamie Baker : Yeah. Okay. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up on that and this one is going to show my age and hopefully not cause anybody there to laugh. But I'm thinking back to the infamous ten-minute turn. What prevents that today? I mean, obviously aircraft sizes, initiative, demographics have changed. I'm guessing people check more bags. I don't know if there's anything in the labor contract that prohibits flight attendant contribution, that sort of thing, a longer stage means more fuel to pump. I'm just wondering what else has happened that prevents you from having a 10-minute turn. And obviously, I'm not suggesting you ever get back there, but I've got to imagine you can do better than what you currently are. So, what are some of the other constraints that I haven't thought through? Gary Kelly : Well, I'll give you a historic answer and the Mike is going to make you and I both look old here. But Mike, his team and technology just rolled out some technology this week, in fact, that will help address what you're describing. But the 10-minute turn -- Jamie, my first flight on Southwest was in 1972 and there were 2 other passengers on the flight. It does not take long to turn an airplane in 10 minutes when there's 3 customers. I asked Lemar Muse when I first became CEO about who was the genius that designed the open seating concept. And he very colorfully told me that you don't need to assign seats when the airplanes are empty. So, the passengers are the gating factor with the term. It's rarely the bags. With a more connecting bags, you have obviously that calculus can change, but I will tell you one other funny old story, these all predate me, although I was a customer in the 1970s and experienced this, we actually would push the airplane before everybody was in their seats, much less buckled in with the seat belt. So, all kind of quaint stories now. But I think you're probably more interested in what can -- we can do realistically. So, Mike, you want to talk about those targets you have? Mike Van De Ven : Yeah, so, yeah all of those things are true that Gary was mentioning, but I think we do focus on the turn and we break it down into different components. And you start just with the different components, we all flow in, and then in clean, and in the loading back up, and there are several things that make the turn longer today than they were back in the days when -- you remember the 10-minute turn. And so, one of the big items right now is the ATA and wheelchairs and making sure that we have wheelchair accommodations for people. That probably adds 3 or 4 or 5 minutes just trying to get people loaded on the airplane, and a lot of times they are magically healed getting on from the slide with [Indiscernible], then getting off. But when they do need them getting off, it actually adds several minutes again. So, I think just the wheelchair process is probably adding five to ten minutes of that in turn. The second thing that you have is just more people are bringing bags on the airplane. And we've got the skies -- the new overhead bins on the new airplanes, trying to get all those things stored. That takes a little bit longer than normal. And those are really the 2 primary things. The third thing is back when I first started that Southwest Airlines, our ops agents for rent a door of the airplane. And so, any coordination they had to do with the cockpit was right there at the door of the airplane. Today, depending on -- you've probably walked down some of the jet bridges, they're long walks and our ops agents sometime have to make that trip 2 or 3 times. And that's one of the things, what Gary was talking about. We just rolled out some technology that will allow us to handle mobile platform and get our ops agents back closer to the door of the airplane. So that will help also. Jamie Baker : Okay, very interesting and enlightening. Thank you for letting me ask that question. Take everybody. Operator : And our next question today comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I know in the past you've talked about just given the number of new airports you've added that you can increase your breadth, basically, and not you've depth, and that most of the capacity growth going forward will be to build back that depth. And I think Tammy in your comments about getting back to that, to bring back productivity. I was just curious in that at what level of capacity would you get back to a level where you can drive better productivity across the network and maybe better recoverability. Tammy Romo : Andrew, I'll start off and then let you chime in any thoughts you have. So yes, just to just to give you an idea of at least how we've deployed our aircraft here currently. We've talked about we added the 18 new cities, and of course we've added Hawaii. So, when you look at all of those together, we have about 92 airplanes deployed in either new cities or in Hawaii service, which means that's 92 aircraft less that we have in our network, pre -pandemic if you will. And so, we need to go back and backfill that number of aircrafts, to at least get us back to kind of where we were pre -pandemic. And then as we look ahead to 2022, we're making some adjustments to our capacity here in the near-term as we've taken you through, so will want to add a back capacity as quickly as we can, but obviously demand's going to be a pacing factor, and of course our staffing levels as we covered with you. So those are just a couple of high-level thoughts. But Andrew, anything -- any more details you'd like to add to that, or thoughts? Andrew Watterson : Yes. To build on that, if you look at the aircraft numbers that Tammy is talking about, that implies it's going to take us over a year to fully restore our network. This is a longer-term play. And we talk about restoration overall like that, but that's a subset of that, a very large subset which is the depth we talk about. And so, the depth markets are primarily business-oriented markets. So, we expect to, with the pace of business travel return, bring in those depth markets over our next year. Those same depth markets are the ones that also facilitate recovery, the day-to-day recovery that Mike was talking about. And our March through summer schedules as we anticipate seeing a step change in that level of density and depth in our network. We won't be fully restored again for over a year. But the part which really appeals of business travelers and helps micro recovery, we expect to see substantial progress from March through the end of summer. Savi Syth : That's super helpful. Thank you. And if I might quickly to follow up on some of the GDS comments. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of the channel shifts that you mentioned and how those lines up versus expectations? Andrew Watterson : So, we're seeing incremental benefit clearly from GDS. It happened just -- when we live with Sabre, a 1/3 of the 3 just before the Delta variant. So given the turmoil of the Delta variant, it's really hard to be conclusive with the trends. The enhance, clearly though, it is incremental, the shift we had planned for from our direct channels to these indirect channels, how to give you a little bit of context, some of our largest corporations actually use all 3. So, they're using Southwest swap is, they're using our direction ACT, and now they're using TDS. And they using it for different populations and travel purposes. So, the amount that's going through each of those 3 channels, really depends on the population of who is traveling at that Company right now. So, it's hard to make definitive statements about what the overall shift will be, more kind of done and dusted here as business travel finishes out its ramp up, but right now we see it's clearly incremental and we certainly planned in our business in case for a substantial amount of shift. Savi Syth : Makes sense. All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays, please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions so I don't know if this is for Bob or Tammy, but how do we think about ongoing costs here? And I guess in regards to recovering the network, getting back into some of those shorter-haul frequencies like you guys talked about. But just longer-term, I think Tammy, you were talking about projects back in 2018, 2019 on the technology side that you guys needed to invest in. So, are we back to an environment where maybe benchmarking to prior cost structures is not the right way to think about it, or can we get back to those unit costs? Tammy Romo : I can start Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have. But yeah, just kind of picking up from where we are here in the third quarter, our CASM ex was up about 3.5%, and that was on a year-over-year 2 basis. And so clearly, we've got some ramp -up cost pressures here currently. And as I said earlier, and that was about 4 points, and that related to premium pay and ramp -up costs. So, if you adjust for that impact, our third quarter CASM ex would have been slightly below our third quarter 2019 on capacity, that's down about 2%. So, we've taken some cost cutting measures here that we've implemented during the pandemic, and that's enabling the voluntary retirement program and our extended lead program. And while those had substantial savings this year, the benefit is certainly temporary as all those employees we'll be back here by year-end. And of course, as you know, we've shared that we're hiring a substantial number of employees, so we've got a goal to hire 5,000 new employees by year-end to replace many of those who left. So, the point being is the cost reductions that we had during the pandemic, those will come back as capacity comes back. So that puts us at a much different point in the ramp up than most of our competitors, if you still have capacity down much more. We've talked about our 18 new cities and Hawaii investment. We've allocated capacity here, and that has come from pulling down our short and medium haul flying. So many of our costs here are back online and I just want to point out again, we're staffing back up. And our network is very different from what it was pre -pandemic. So that's kind of where we are today. And then we've also experienced several years of wage rate inflation from where we were in 2019. And as I covered earlier, as we got inflation in airports and pretty much across the board. So, when you add to that, lower productivity we're experiencing from some of the behavior changes that we've talked about in this really tough operating environment. Point being, the environment is just different here. So, getting to your question, as we move forward, the main thing will want to focus on here is regaining our historical productivity edge. And clearly the biggest thing is gain operating leverage through restoring the majority of our pre -pandemic network. I know that was kind of a long-winded answer there, but there just are a lot of moving parts here. So, we're going to be focused on improving our productivity as we move forward, but I think the biggest question mark I have right now is just what it's going to be the extent of the inflationary pressures that we're feeling. Bob Jordan : Yeah, and I'll give you the 50,000-foot view, maybe the way I'm thinking about it is we've got -- nothing is normal right now. There are just all kinds of fits and starts in the business and different behaviors, and so you've got extra cost and inefficiency that comes through the network moving around. We've had schedules, we cut them back, you've had inefficiencies that have come through just hiring, we're staffing, it takes a while to get people through training, we're still behind. It takes a while for those folks to become productive, so you've got cost inefficiencies there. We had changes in behavior, I think those are largely COVID -driven, so we have obviously direct COVID pulls were people they're literally pulled off camp, can't work because of a COVID contact. We have excess sick leave as compared to normal. We have more folks on leaves as compared to normal. That's likely due to -- connected to bringing folks back from those extended leaves earlier than they had planned. So, there's all kinds of stuff that is in there. And it's hard to tease apart exactly what the value is of each. So, I'm with Tammy. Job 1 is to stabilize all of that and then work to get ourselves back to pre -pandemic levels of productivity and efficiency. And from then work on cost pass savage. Job 1 is to get back to the -- to wring all this out and back to the productivity that we had prior to COVID. Gary Kelly : And if I could just pile one in, I would -- if you think about airplanes, airports, and people, I think we've got a line of sight on airplanes. Bob Jordan : Yeah Gary Kelly : And that's pretty much in our control. Airports, I think, are close to that. And I absolutely -- I agree with Bob and Tammy. The goal will be to get back to people productivity that we had pre -pandemic, and that we're just going to have to work our way through that. But that will absolutely be the goal. Brandon Oglenski : I mean, is it incremental hiring that you guys need to get going forward to get back to that productivity levels? Gary Kelly : I think it's yes and no. So right now, the way to think about it is it takes more people per departure than before. The analogy would be like the United States participation rate. Our participation rate actually producing flights is less today than historically, and Bob ticked through it, it's excess sick, more people on leave, etc. As we get the pandemic behind us, I for one think that that will revert back to the mean, and we'll trend and achieve prior productivity rates. The plus on what's you're asking in terms of hiring is we've got 24 airplanes sitting on the ground doing nothing. We've got airplanes that we want to add to the fleet next year. So absolutely hiring will address that and that will be a productivity contributor on the airport and the airplane side. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks for the time. So, I'm curious if you could share kind of what you've learned from a network perspective that strain the operation. Every carrier has been contorting their network to this demand environment. I think you lengthen stage length. In past media you talked about how much of your capacity touches Florida. What are the lessons learned? And if we dig through your future plans, what are the types of markets you've moved away from in an effort to improve the operation? Andrew Watterson : I think the first thing is we moved in the summer, we curbed four schedules based on overseeing with staffing and Tom ended up -- Gary and Bob referenced. And we just took more people per trip, and so we made big lower trips from October through the end of the year. So just the level of capacity versus staffing was the initial issue. The second is the day-to-day recovery is more difficult when you have fewer options for free accommodation without reaccommodating the customer, the crew, or even the airplane to get it where it needs to be that night. And so, bringing back that density, we've identified as the number one thing that will help our day-to-day operations recover more easily when there are things that are exogenous shocks from weather or something else that allows us to recover. And so, getting that back is going to be -- or what we're using our aircraft over at least the next year. And is it kind of -- that our network that was pre -existing in 2019 will come to look a lot like what we have at the end of next summer, at the end of next year, that core part that operated very well and produced good results. We'll start to look a whole lot similar. It takes a while to get there, but that's where we'll be using the aircraft for versus say, growth in breadth options, which would be used during the pandemic. Gary Kelly : And Duane -- and Andrew, you chimed in on this, but I don't think that it's so much a stage length long-haul or short-haul as it is more of a tilt towards leisure markets. So that lends itself to thinner frequencies, may be longer distances. Obviously, Hawaii has a huge impact on averages here, because we beefed up that service. But a lot of our traditional business markets were a higher-frequency short-haul, and we've sent those out. So, I think it's more, Andrew, the leisure business that we've adjusted now, and we want to go back to restoring, which will be more short-haul, more business-oriented, which beefs up the backbone and helps with recoverability. So, I don't know if there is a learning that we've had. I think actually things are playing out the way we thought. But we're all anxious now that demand has recovered. I mean, that's encouraging thing here because now we're in a position where we can sort of pursue our strategy. It's playing out like we hoped and we want to keep the new markets we added. We just want to get back to restoring the traditional Southwest networks, which we think is going to drive a really nice profit. They'll develop very rapidly. Andrew Watterson : That's correct. The restorations should be very low risk. And the leisure portion is absolutely correct. In fact, if you dig into the issue Mike talked about with connections, it wasn't so much the nominal connections of kind of customers, which are actually flat, slightly down. It's connecting bags, it cutting bags were up because we have more leisure customers. And leisure customers checked bags at a higher rate of business customers. And so, as we get back to a better business-leisure mix, we should see the proportion of bags and connecting bags coming down on the network, which will also be a tailwind operationally, Bob Jordan : Edwin, I actually think the learning and wasn't on the network side. I mean, our network folks and our operational analytics folks are on top of all this stuff. They understand what we're doing. And then obviously, they understand what we have done to ourselves. If we back off frequencies and depth, obviously it's going to be tougher to recover our customers and move our crews around. So, we knew all that. I think that -- I think the two learnings are -- again, we've talked about this a lot. We depended on some hiring to get staff to support that network and it was just tough to get there. So, by the time we were ready to fly, for example, the summer, we just weren't staffed to the point that we thought we would be. And the second learning really was how important the margin is, whether it's cruise or round operations, but I think especially cruise. And as we had lower margin things like reserves and all that, the operation is just -- it deteriorates faster as you eat up that margin that you've got especially on the crew side. So, to me really the learning is on just how important it is, Mike talked about this, to have that margin in the crew network especially as you operate. And then again, in a centered network with lower frequencies, as you have to use a part of that margin to move, cruise around, and those kinds of things, it's just not there. So, to me there were learnings that are really more there, the importance of staffing, than they were on the network design. Gary Kelly : Yeah. I'll just pile on very end here, Duane, but the biggest learning that I've had is, and I talked about it earlier, is this industry ecosystem. And it's dependent on having people at work. And it doesn't matter where it is. It can be hotels, it can be van drivers, it could be people working at the airports, but the people, if you have enough people, you can have an up-tempo business and that's what our business -- our whole industry's business wasn't as fastest tempo as everybody had planned it to be. And that's where I think everybody got into issues with their on-time performance and their staffing in their crews. And so, everything that everybody else said, I totally agree with it. To me, it's people in the industry that slowly tempo down. We want to be an up-tempo operation and to get that we need more people, we needed more frequencies. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's super helpful. And maybe just to segue on that last point on labor availability, your ability to hire grant ground, airport staff, or whatever it is you need to support that operation. I assume as you raise rates, that creates demand and more people show up. But I guess normalizing for that, are you seeing any relief on that front? Are you seeing more people apply for open positions? Are you seeing any clouds parting on that front? Thank you. Gary Kelly : Yeah, I think on the hiring front, it's just looked across the whole United States or the world, hiring is just more difficult because the labor pool is smaller with folks who have not come back into the labor pool. So that's just where we all start. Southwest is a terrific company, a terrific employer, terrific benefits, and so we do not struggle to get applicants. The applicant rates are a little below normal, which is to be expected given the number of open jobs. But no, we've not struggled to get applicants. I think the issues have probably been a couple of things. One, we spent 18 months or a little bit less hiring no one. I mean, basically, no one. In fact, we kind of dismantled the hiring machine and folks that work there and put them into other parts of the business. So, once you decide to hire, which for us was probably April, you have to decide and then you have to rebuild the team that actually works on all that. So, by the time we really got to moving, it's July or August of this year before you can really have new folks back into serving -- to working and serving the airline. You also have to rebuild your training. But I think overall, again, it's a tough hiring environment but we are not struggling to get people. It is more competitive than ever, and it's especially competitive in our more entry-level jobs, for example, ramp. On the ramp at airports and it's more competitive in certain parts of the country, like in Denver for example. But no, we're not struggling to find people, we just need -- we need a lot, and it's a competitive market, and it takes a while to get them from the hiring -- for the point of hiring, to the point of actually being at work. We are using all kinds of new techniques we had not used in the past, instant interviews, instant offers, contingent offers where somebody goes into training ahead of their -- the required things like drug testing and background checking, those kinds of thing. So no, I think -- I'm optimistic, we just have a lot to do, trying to hire close to over 5,000 this fall and 8,000 next year. I do think in fairness to your question, there is one thing that I learned here that I would like to share, and that is -- and I don't -- and for everybody on the phone, I don't know what your lives have been like over the past 20 months, but I bet they've been impacted dramatically. And many of you may be working remotely. So, because you've done that, your habits have changed and we can all speculate on what things are different for you now. Our people are the same way and especially the people that went on leave, and in our peak Bob, didn't we have 15,000 people that went out on leave? Bob Jordan : Yeah. Gary Kelly : So, an assumption that I made was that we're going to call them and say, okay, it's time to come back. They're going to show up. Everything's going to be just like it was. And it's just not. And so, I do think I personally underestimated that coming into this year. I'll just repeat what I said earlier. For a long time, we had nothing to do, and then all of a sudden, wham, we had to pick up the pace like Mike was describing, and it's just been messy. So, I think all that will smooth out both with our existing employees that we're trying to get back in several back and new hires as well, but it's not going to be here in the fourth quarter. It's going to take a while, Bob Jordan : And one last question and I'll be done, is the -- I've gotten it a lot, which is the requirement to have new hires vaccinated, is that hurting you? Is it limiting your applicant pool? And the short answer is no. We have, I think 50,000 people in the hiring or applicant process whenever we decided to shift and require that our new hires be vaccinated, and we've seen less than 2% drop out of the process because of that. In other words, the 98 plus percent are either already vaccinated or are going to get vaccinated in order to be able to come to work for Southwest Airlines, which number one tells you it's not an impediment, and number two, it tells you people want to work for Southwest Airlines, which is terrific. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much. Tammy, you talked about some of the inflationary pressures when it comes to labor and the team talked about that extensively. So, I want to switch gears, maybe talking about higher fuel prices and how you guys are thinking about that as it affects your route expansion. Tammy Romo : Yes. So yeah, that, as you know, fuel cost has historically been 1/3 of our cost structure, so it's certainly an input. As we think about the pace of our expansion here. So, it just goes into the mix with all the other costs. But the good news is, we have a really great hedge in place to at least help launch the market prices that we're seeing here. And our -- the fair market value of our hedge book is over EUR900 million. So, we've got a lot of really great protection in place should we continue to see fuel prices at these levels are higher. That said, we're still going to see some inflation and our fuel costs at higher fuel levels. So that will just obviously, be taken into consideration along with all of the rest of our cost structure as we plan our future capacity plans. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : And we have time for one more question today. And we will take our last question from Helane Becker at Cowen, please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, Operator. Hi everybody, and thanks for the time. 2 questions. One, Gary, is this your last earnings call? Are you going to be back for next year? And I guess you'll be back for Investor Day. Gary Kelly : Yeah, I'll be there for Investor Day and my transition date is February 1, so I'm going to come back and haunt you one more time. See you in January. Helane Becker : Okay. All right. Well, that's fair enough. I'll see you -- I guess we'll see you in December. And then my other question is really with respect to technology. You guys spent a lot of money on technology over the last few years, ramping up, getting ready for more business travel and getting ready for more TDS exposure. And now I'm wondering, like what's next, what's next on that front? And if you could just talk a little bit about that. Bob Jordan : Now, Helane, every Company I think at this point is that some part of them they are a technology Company. It's central to everything that we do and obviously central to everything that we do at Southwest Airlines because we're so dependent. I would tell you we have all kinds of priorities and some of those are -- we have every year and ongoing and they are revenue initiatives that we'll be sharing with you in December. And most of those required technology, but I would -- and Mike can comment on this. To me, if I had a headline, it's our investment in operational tools. Our people are terrific, we have good tools, but at our size and scale and complexity, I think there is a need to continue to invest heavily in the operation and in -- particularly heavily in the operational tools that we provide to our employees. They're terrific. but they could use tools that better help manage their day, manage the complexity. And so, to me, if I had to rank order, the number 1 objective is our continued investment in our -- what Mike and I are just calling modernizing our operational tools. Mike, do you want to add on to that? Mike Van De Ven : Yeah. Helane, I think Bob covered it mostly. But when you think about modernizing the operation, we just -- we rolled out a significant enhancement to our maintenance systems this year, and we've got one last piece to get our our MAX aircraft and our 800 of rolled into that here in November. So that's a big enhancement, a big modernization, if you will, in our maintenance systems. And our maintenance systems that it was replacing is close to 30 years old. So, I think that you could categorize the different kinds of opportunities we have in those areas. We've got things that we want to do in flight planning. We've got things we want to do in our crewing systems. We have things that we wanted to do as we are coordinating and executing our turns on the ground. And then we have investments we want to make in our decision support and optimization of technology. So, we've got a good array of things that we want to go do, and we can talk more about those a little bit more detail in our Investor Day. Helane Becker : That's very helpful. Thanks, everybody. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Helane. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Well, that puts us at time here for the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Rocco, and welcome to everyone, members of media to our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion. Rocco, if will just give them some instructions on how to queue up for a question. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And our first question today comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Gary, earlier today in an interview you were talking about how you don't really support forcing employees to get vaccinations as a corporate employer, and you said you were doing the bare minimum to comply with the federal mandate. And my question is, whether there's not some concern within Southwest that by saying things like that and proceeding in that way, that you're going to lose travelers to people who prefer an airline that can say 99.7% of their people have been vaccinated against Coronavirus? Gary Kelly : Well, Mary, I think it's 2 different things. We have an executive order that's mandating the vaccines, and we're doing everything that we can to comply with that. Number 1, we're encouraging everybody to get vaccinated, and if they can't do that, then their option is to seek an accommodation. So, I don't see them as inconsistent, it just simply -- I for one, am empathetic with those who don't want to be vaccinated, and it's not -- I don't see that it is our role to enforce a mandate coming from us. This is the U.S. Government's President of the United States, I respect that, and we're doing everything that we can in good faith to implement it. So, I don't believe that we're going to be in any difference spot than any other airline in terms of our health and safety, Mary Schlangenstein : And would it not help consumers though if you were to disclose the percentage of your employees who are already vaccinated? Gary Kelly : Well, we will at the right point. The deadline to comply with the federal -- the executive order is November the 24th. And right now, we've got a majority of our employees have reported. Of those who have reported, the super majority of them have been vaccinated. But we still have a large percentage who have not reported, and it would just be pure speculation on our part how many of those are already vaccinated, we just haven't heard from them yet for whatever reason. So just be patient with us. When we get to November the 24th, we will obviously be sharing that information. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. You talked a lot over the last couple of months about taking some of the depth out of your network and adding all the breadth with the new cities. And I guess just curious, in retrospect, given all the complications that it has caused, if you still think that that was the right strategy. If you could go back in time, do you still think it made sense that that's going to pay off in the long run or have those complications in the last couple of months made you question it at all? Gary Kelly : Well, I disagree with the assertion that it's created complications. Our primary challenge is we just don't have enough people, resources to match up with the effort required to operate flights and serve our customers. When we do get into a situation where we're trying to manage irregular operations. We've got a great strategy with backbone, with depth. And that's clearly on our work plan for 2022, but Alison, there's just -- there's no way to manage through a pandemic other than when the demand is cut by 98%, it would be foolish to fly the same schedule. So, we -- that schedule has served us well. It's something that we're very enthused about going forward. Now we very quickly and happily shifted to a need to go back and restore some depth in the network, and that will be very, very welcome. But in any event the kinds of challenges that we've had this summer, we'd have them whether we had the old schedule or whether we had this schedule. They're -- the root cause is we just need more people resources, period, Bob Jordan : I think the data proves it out. If you look at our performance from August and then look September and beyond, when we reduced the amount of flying. Our on-time performance substantially increased into September all the way up to just before October 8th. You added the fact that there's one runway in Dallas which is a big -- probably it was more than we expected. Our performance during that period of time with reduced activity but still this broad network was satisfactory. Now, we want more depth because it helps our business customers, it helps recovery, all things being equal. But it's a tailwind we're seeking, not necessarily a root cause. Gary Kelly : And it's not as if we have dismantled the network, it was built over 50 years. That's also incorrect. It's a pretty big change from where we were, but certainly the bones are still there. Alison Sider : Thank you. Gary Kelly : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Leslie Josephs at CNBC. Please go ahead. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning, everyone or good afternoon, everyone. What was the reason for pulling back on that plan to do unpaid leave for the people that have exemptions that haven't yet been approved or we're still being reviewed? And then my second question just, is there any concern about your network next year, particularly in the summer with international coming back from your competitors who are really ramping up other destinations? So just curious how you're thinking about competition from other places to go. Gary Kelly : I'll let you guys take the letter. I'll talk about the vaccines. And if you don't mind, I'm just going to give you 2 minutes on what our objectives are here. 1. We are -- and this somewhat ties in with Mary's question. We want this pandemic to end, so we certainly want to do everything that we can to encourage people to get vaccinated. I for one believe that that is the past, and that's the path that we're promoting. We have tried to encourage people to get vaccinated and further with incentives, as opposed to using a more punitive approach as an example like charging employees if they are unvaccinated. So, we're not doing the latter, we're doing the former, which is try to encourage. So, I think that's important as a background here. Second, our objective is to take care of our people in every way that we can; in terms of their safety, in terms of their health, in terms of their job security. I think everyone should get vaccinated. However, I respect other views and especially when you consider how much information there is out there, and pretty much any view you want to find support for, you can. And that has to obviously be confusing for people. So, I don't feel that it's up to me to force people to get vaccinated. So, I think that's important in answering your question that you know that those are two of our objectives. As a practical matter, we've got important trips for our customers coming up in this quarter. In other words, the holidays. The last thing I want as our people distracted was something like this vaccine mandate. The last thing I want is for people to fear that they won't be able to work or have a job. And so, we simply put that to rest. And that ties in with -- so that objective, I'm sure you would readily recognize that it's fourthly, which ties into that. We are a government contractor. We have been for decades. It is important to us in a variety of ways. And number one, we serve the military with charters. And number two, we're part of the civil reserve air fleet, which as an example, just helped with African refugees. So those are important to us. In addition to that, they are our largest customer. We carry the mail; we carry a number of government employees as passengers under this contract. So, we're going to do everything that we can to maintain that contract. And we didn't ask for the mandate, but we got it. And the order is from the White House, so all of the agencies we actually contract with, they're getting direction, which is very general from the White House. And as that direction evolves, we evolve with it. And I think what again, just to tie in Mary's question, all I was trying to communicate to everyone is that we are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated. What we are trying to do is whatever we need to do to comply with the executive order so we can maintain our government contract status. And if that means that we can do that and not force people off the job in December, that's why we -- this is an evolving process working with the government in terms of what they expect. And very clearly, we wanted our employees know that nobody is going to lose their job on December the 9th if we're not perfectly in compliance. It is a work in progress and we're going to continue working in good faith to meet the requirements of the executive order. But I've already said and I'm sure you heard that we're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated. How we work through the people that don't get vaccinated or don't seek an accommodation, we're going to have to figure out and we're working with the government on that. But we're not going to fire anybody. It makes no sense that we would not respect that and find some way to work with our people on that. And that's what we're determined to do is get the right balance between taking care of our people and maintaining our government contractor status. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today sounds from Dawn Gilbertson, as USA Today. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi. Good morning and unbelievably, it's still morning here. I think this is for Gary or Bob. On the vaccine mandate from the consumer perspective, United CEO made some pretty strong comments yesterday warning about potential holiday travel chaos that other airlines that are still going through this vaccine mandate issue going so far as to say buyer beware. Could this follow any follow-up from this trip you up over the holidays? And if not, why not? And one of the examples outside that he gave was, say there is a testing regimen put in place. He said that potentially, you guys could have a lot of last -minute -- he didn't say you specifically. Airlines could have a lot of last -minute cancellations as people tested positive, and so forth. So, I just would like to get your thoughts on that. And secondly, I would also like to know who is deciding? Is it Southwest people who gets these exemptions and how rigorous a process is? Because it seems like you guys are encouraging people to apply for the -- thank you. Gary Kelly : Yes, we're not going to disrupt travel. And the White House has been clear that they do not want travel disrupted ever, much less during the holidays. And that they understand that there is a process that we work through with people who have not complied either by being vaccinated or being accommodated. So, they have made that clear, and we are very well aligned with the White House direction on all of that. So again -- and Dawn, I would just say, my duty is to take care of Southwest Airlines. My duty is to take care of our people and our customers, and we're not going to let this disrupt any of our customers' travel, especially during the busy holiday season. With respect to accommodations, this is something that is longstanding within the Company. It is a function that we have in Linda's department and Linda you're welcome to speak to this; but we have a team of experts who know what the rules are and know how to apply them in terms of medical or religious accommodations. I believe it's Title VII for religious and the ADA for medical. So, it's not anything new and there are experts at it. What we're trying to do right now is to see what accommodation requests we get so that we can ensure that we're consistent. In terms of who we accept and who we deny. Obviously, we're trying to work with our people here and take good care of them. In terms of encouragement, we are encouraging people to get vaccinated, period. We bet -- there's nothing new that, I've been doing that since the vaccine came out and nothing has changed there. Only thing that's changed is we've got this executive order that mandates the vaccine and we are working through that in a good faith way and with our best efforts. Is there anything else you want to add? Dawn Gilbertson : What is the [Indiscernible] on that? Gary Kelly : Now, sure. Dawn Gilbertson : Do you -- are you guys seeking an extension on this deadline from the government? Gary Kelly : We're using our best efforts to make the deadline. We have not asked for an extension. We're seeing great progress from our employees and we'll see what happens. We'll see where we get to on November 24th, which is the key date. In other words, to make the December 8th deadline because of the, because of the two-week vaccination time period. Anything you want to add on the accommodation process, Linda? Linda Rutherford : No, I think you handled it well, it's just our all-out efforts around education and awareness is to get employees in one of two buckets, and that is to be vaccinated or to seek an accommodation if that is what they need. Gary Kelly : And as I think everyone on the call knows, it's a political issue, it's a polarizing issue, and there are very strong feelings among some on both sides of this question. So, my job is to take care of Southwest, to take care of all of our people, whether they're on one side or the other, and we're going to do our darnest to accomplish that. Dawn Gilbertson : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. Our next question comes from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Good afternoon and I apologize. My questions have been mostly asked and answered, but just to clarify a couple of things, Gary. Do you have an assurance from the administration that they will let contractors as such as yourself accept testing instead of vaccination as an accommodation for some of your employees? And my other question is -- or maybe not a question, but I raised this earlier with the folks at American. United and Delta gave numbers and percentages on the number of people vaccinated early on and then just updated them, and I'm wondering why you can't do that as well. Gary Kelly : David, I just can't pass up the opportunity to say that I agree with your thought that executives ought to have at least two alcoholic drinks before these conference calls. However, I will say that no one in this room has done that. So, I believe that the Herb Kelleher way, but we're not subscribing to it, at least not yet. And now I've talked enough and I forgot your questions. On the percentages, I'm not prepared to share percentages because I don't believe they would be helpful or realistic. We've got a November 24th deadline that we're working hard towards. The majority of our employees have responded to the call for either an accommodation or a vaccination, And the super majority of those who have reported so far are vaccinated. But I don't know whether that percentage would be meaningful or relevant to because there's a large percentage that we have not heard from yet, and I have no idea what they will do or how vaccinated they are. And just remind me what your first question was? Oh, the testing. David Koenig : I was wondering [Indiscernible] in the administration. Gary Kelly : No, we have -- of course not. You've got the executive order, and so do we. And you either get a medical accommodation or religious accommodation. Now, whether there's a testing requirement for those who are accommodated, there's no guidance in the order on that. We're aware obviously, of the proposed OSHA regulation, which has not come out, and which does provide for testing. So, the two are not reconciled for us at this point. We are working on all fronts. But yeah, we know what you know on that front. David Koenig : Okay. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Rocco. Of course, any members of the media who have follow-up, please contact our communications group. They are standing by at 214-792-4847. You can always visit www. swamedia.com. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. This conference is now concluded. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter Annual 2021 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Chad. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share some brief remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on our call today, we have our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Executive Vice President and Incoming CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. Just a few quick notes. First, we will make forward-looking statements today which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And second, we had a few special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference these non-GAAP results in our remarks today. So, please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information and our cautionary statement which cover these topics in more detail. So, with that, I have the pleasure of turning it over one last time to my friend, Gary Kelly. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Ryan. And good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for the Southwest Airlines fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. And first and foremost, I\u2019m delighted to be able to say there were earnings and better than we thought at Investor Day last month. It\u2019s obviously a great way to end a tough, but much improved year, a great way to start a new year. We\u2019re, of course, finding our way through the Omicron surge in January, February, and looking forward to a strong rebound in March and thereafter. And, as always, as barring any unforeseen events, I expect we\u2019ll make great progress in 2022 and will enjoy another much improved year. As we all know too well, it will not be without its challenges. But, our people and our leadership are more than up to the task. I\u2019m enormously proud of all of them. And I thank them profusely for their resilience and their perseverance through these myriad of challenges that we\u2019ve faced the last two years. They\u2019ve just done a phenomenal job. Southwest is on top, because our people deliver great service, low fares and our business model delivers consistent profits and handsome returns on capital. And we\u2019ve emerged from two years of pandemic with our balance sheet strength and our liquidity intact. And we are perfectly positioned to restore, to expand and compete aggressively in the coming years. And I could not be more enthused and more excited about our future. So, with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to our outstanding CEO and waiting for five more days, Mr. Bob Jordan. Bob Jordan : Well, thank you, Gary, and hello, everybody. We were last together on December 8th at Investor Day, and a lot has happened since then. But before I get to that, I want to thank my friend Gary Kelly. Gary is a phenomenal leader and done so much for Southwest and for me personally. There\u2019s no -- there\u2019s just no way to say thank you enough for his 18 years of leadership as our CEO. And I\u2019m thrilled that he will be our Executive Chairman. I\u2019ll take over the CEO responsibility for investor meetings going forward. So, this is Gary\u2019s last earnings call. And my friend, I just want to stop and say a huge thank you and I love you. Well, 2022 has had a challenging start, but that doesn\u2019t change our goals for the year, getting properly staffed focusing on our people, making meaningful progress returning to our historic operational reliability and efficiency, providing our legendary hospitality and returning to consistent profitability. We made significant progress in \u201821, including a profitable fourth quarter, despite the pandemic and saw strong demand. 88% of 2019 revenues restored and managed business demand ahead of our expectations for December. While we don\u2019t expect to be profitable this quarter, the Omicron impact does appear to be isolated to January and February, and we expect a profit in March, expect to be profitable in the remaining quarters and for the full year 2022 based on our current plans. Our people performed just really well during fourth quarter as they always do, and particularly during the holidays and demand held up well through year and despite the Omicron variant. Beginning in early January, we experienced a very difficult environment due to rapidly rising COVID cases and a decrease in available staffing levels. It\u2019s amazing, when in the first three weeks we had roughly 5,000 employees test positive for COVID, with employee cases roughly 2.5 times what they were during the Delta variant. The resulting staffing shortage combined with winter weather caused a spike in flight cancels and a significant disruption to the operation. I\u2019m pleased to report though that over the last few weeks, the operation and staffing has stabilized, and we\u2019ve seen performance even better than during the holidays. Yesterday, for example, we were 95% on time, which I\u2019m just usually proud of. To maintain sufficient available staff, we extended incentive pay programs for Ops Employees through early February. While that does add temporary cost pressure, it\u2019s imperative that we have sufficient staff to operate our schedule and minimize our flight cancellations. COVID case counts are on a downward trend and we intend to normalize our staffing and pay structure as a result. Hiring is part of the equation, of course, and we met our 2021 hiring goals and we are on track with plans to add at least 8,000 employees this year. We\u2019re also raising our starting wage rates to be competitive in the market and due to the impacts from Omicron and the variant and recent staffing challenges. And we\u2019re further moderating our first half 2022 capacity plans to provide additional buffer for the operation. We\u2019re encouraged by the recent improvement in bookings across the booking curve, especially in the March timeframe and we are hopeful that business travel resume the 2021 trend. It appears that Omicron impacts are pretty well contained to January and February from a revenue perspective, and we believe our temporary approach to boost available staffing is working. We\u2019ll stay flexible, of course, and we\u2019ll be willing to further adjust our plans if needed. So, several things have transpired since Investor Day, all driven by the pandemic though, but for Omicron, we would be on our Investor Day Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. However, I want you to know, make no mistake, we are laser focused on preserving our low cost position in the industry and returning to 2018 productivity and efficiency levels by the end of 2023. We believe Q1 CASM-X as a peak, and our plans call for unit cost to ease from here into 2023. Looking at 2023 based on current growth plans, we expect CASM-X to be down as compared to 2022. Restoring both, the network and our fleet efficiency are key to returning to historic efficiency levels. And beyond that, I\u2019m really excited about opportunities that continue network growth as we add gates in key cities such as Denver and Phoenix and Las Vegas, Baltimore, Nashville and even more. Beyond 2023, we see opportunities to meet and then beat our historic productivity and efficiency levels as we continue to grow the Company and focus on modernizing our operational tools and processes. And Mike will talk more about that. But I want to repeat my main message from Investor Day. Despite the near-term noise, we have a superb business model, the substantial underlying competitive advantages. We have a great five-year strategy and a strong set of initiatives that will drive significant value. Our new co-brand credit card agreement is in place with a partner Chase, our GDS expansion is complete and our Southwest business team is armed with the tools they need to grow our business customer base. We continue to work on our new fare product and our revenue management system optimization, so more to come there. But both should begin producing value this year. And as we continue retiring older 737-700 aircraft and taking the MAX aircraft this year, in support of our fleet modernization initiatives as well. All combined, these initiatives are expected to deliver incremental EBIT of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2023, and we continue to expect roughly half of that value this year, given the initiatives in place. Like Gary said, last but not least, I just want to thank our amazing people. There have been all kinds of challenges and they have performed just superbly. They continue to do an incredible job and manage through all of these challenges, and I am just in awe of them. And together, we will emerge from the pandemic, and we will seize the opportunities in front of us. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Right. Hello, everyone, and thank you, Bob. I\u2019ve worked with Bob for a long time, and I agree with Gary. He is going to be a great CEO. And my friend, Gary Kelly, you are amazing, and I just want to thank you for all that you\u2019ve done for our company and for all of us and for all of our shareholders. And I\u2019m not going to say anything else because I will get choked up. So, instead, I\u2019m going to provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our outlook beyond what we provided in our press release to you all this morning. And I also just want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience as we manage through this dynamic environment. It is their hard work, dedication and focus that enabled us to achieve an important milestone in our recovery with our first quarterly profit since the pandemic began. We reported a $68 million profit in fourth quarter or $0.11 per diluted share. And excluding special items, we reported an $85 million profit or $0.14 per diluted share. As Bob mentioned, our fourth quarter profit was driven by strong leisure demand during the holidays, business travel momentum and incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. Our fourth quarter results were all within the guidance ranges provided last month at Investor Day. For full year 2021, our net income was $977 million or $1.61 per diluted share, driven by $2.7 billion of payroll support program proceeds. Excluding this temporary benefit to salary, wages, and benefits expense and other smaller special items, our full year net loss was $1.3 billion or a $2.15 loss per diluted share. Andrew will cover our revenue trends and outlook here in a minute. Taking a look at cost. We continue to experience inflationary cost pressure experienced in fourth quarter, primarily in salary, wages and benefits and airport costs as expected. A portion relates to hiring, and we made great strides toward our hiring efforts in 2021 and remain on track with plans this year. And, of course, the labor market continues to be a challenge, which continues to pressure wage rates across the board. Since Investor Day, we have experienced additional cost pressures related to Omicron and winter weather. As a result, our first quarter unit cost inflation compared with first quarter 2019 and excluding fuel special items and profit sharing has increased about 10 points. Roughly half of that increase is driven by the $150 million of additional incentive pay we are offering to operations employees to early February, and the other half is associated with flying fewer ASMs than we were planning. In light of the significant impact from the Omicron wave on available staffing, extending the temporary incentive pay and further reducing our capacity were necessary steps to stabilize the operation. Aside from these impacts, we would be on track with our previous unit cost outlook. Market fuel prices have continued to rise here, which also resulted in a $0.10 increase in our fuel cost per gallon guidance. Our estimated first quarter fuel price in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range is also roughly $0.25 higher than our first quarter 2019 fuel price, and that\u2019s inclusive of an estimated $0.35 of hedging gains here in the first quarter. Turning to our full year guidance. At Investor Day, we were planning for capacity to be roughly flat versus 2019 levels with no material impact from the Omicron variant on either revenues or costs at that time. Fast forward to today, the impact from the Omicron variant on available staffing has led us to reevaluate our first half 2022 capacity plans, in particular March through May. Our planned flight schedule adjustments take some capacity upside optimism off the table for this year and reduces our full year 2022 capacity outlook by about 4 points from roughly flat to down 4% versus 2019. I\u2019ve already covered the $150 million of additional incentive pay in first quarter. And in order to be more competitive on the hiring front, in particular for ground operations, we are raising starting wage rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour, which is estimated to be a $20 million to $25 million total impact to this year. And of course, we have contemplated labor rate inflation in our guidance as best we can for this year, understanding that the market is somewhat uncertain. This is clearly not where we hope to be along our recovery curve nearly two years into this pandemic, but we are making great progress. While we must remain nimble in this environment, it takes the necessary actions to take care of our employees and provide a reliable product for our customers. We are very focused on the long term and determined to get back to 2018 levels of productivity and efficiencies as we shared with you all at Investor Day. As Bob said, our goal is to get there by the end of next year. Although it is early based on our current plan for 2022 and preliminary plan for 2023, we expect 2023 CASM-X will decline year-over-year compared with 2022. Longer term, our framework that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged, and that includes a post-pandemic target of mid-single-digit ASM growth accompanied by low single-digit CASM-X growth. I want to be clear that our longer-term CASM-X framework includes an estimate for labor rate increases as best we can estimate today. Turning to fleet. We currently have 77 MAX firm orders and 37 MAX options with Boeing this year. While our plan assumes we will exercise the remaining 37 options this year, we maintain the flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise. We continue to believe that taking the additional options this year will yield a positive NPV on aircraft replacement if we don\u2019t deploy them in the network. As I have mentioned to you all before, we won\u2019t incur a material CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft in the event we temporarily park some of our -700 while capacity is moderated this year. As we work our way back to an efficient utilization of the fleet, we remain in the fortunate position to have the flexibility needed with our retirement plans without a financial penalty. I\u2019ll wrap up with a quick note on our balance sheet strength. We ended 2021 with liquidity of $16.5 billion, our leverage is at a very manageable 54%, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which I believe is one of our key competitive advantages. We have ample liquidity that allows us for a further cushion in the event of further COVID wave. Overall, our balance sheet strength puts us in a category of one in terms of our ability to withstand shocks and remain financially healthy. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you very much, Tammy. I\u2019ll also start by extending my gratitude to Gary. I\u2019ll be forever grateful for all that he taught me with his words and its actions. And I\u2019ll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking back to our last earnings call in October, we were dealing with a Delta variant. The negative revenue impact to Q3 was $300 million. At that time, we estimated negative revenue impact to Q4 of $100 million. Revenue trends have begun to pick up -- pick back up and stabilize in mid-September, and our outlook called for a sequential monthly improvement in revenues throughout Q4. We reaffirmed this in our early December investor update, and we closed the quarter strong. Our operating revenues finished within guidance, down 11.8%. And managed business revenues came in better than guidance, down 50% in December. We saw solid leisure demand for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and business demand held up well with positive momentum from GDS and Southwest business. The negative revenue impact from the Delta variant came in lower than we thought at around $60 million as we saw a continued rebound in demand and yields throughout the quarter. However, we saw some choppiness in late December from decelerating bookings and increasing cancellations, and we had a $30 million negative revenue impact from the Omicron variant as COVID cases increased. Combined, this $90 million COVID impact in Q4 was slightly less than our original estimate of $100 million from COVID as we were able to mitigate some of the load factor decrease through higher yields. And, of course, the most notable item in Q4 was incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement with Chase, which we covered at Investor Day and included in our most recent revenue guidance. While we can\u2019t share the specifics about the incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement, you can see that other revenues in fourth quarter 2021 increased 20% compared with Q4 2019 while outpacing the recovery in passenger revenue, and we are on track for expected benefits in 2022. Our new markets continue to develop and perform overall in line with expectations aside from the impacts from the Delta and Omicron waves. Hawaiian markets also showed improvement, and all of these markets turned in line with a broad-based improvement we saw across the rest of the network. Now, looking at first quarter, we estimate the weather-related and staff-related flight cancellations in January, resulting in a $50 million negative impact to operating revenues. Additionally, bookings have slowed for January and February, which are seasonally low travel periods anyway for leisure. And trip cancellations were running quite high, beginning in early January but have moderated and are back to normal trends. We expect the Omicron-related negative revenue impact to January and February combined to be roughly $330 million. Like the Delta variant, the impact of Omicron-related trip cancellations has been mainly focused in the closed-in window, and we remain optimistic about the likelihood of demand recovery and time for spring break travel. On the corporate travel side, the business demand we experienced in December has slowed, but we continue to believe there is pent-up demand for business travel, and we are hearing from many of our corporate customers that they intend to ramp up travel post-President\u2019s Day. I think that will depend on where we are with COVID case counts and hospitalizations, but we are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in terms of their future travel plans. We expect first quarter managed business revenues to be down 45% to 55% versus 2019, and improve sequentially from January through March. And our Southwest and GDS business initiatives is also on track for expected benefits in 2022. When you put all these moving parts together, that gets us to our first quarter operating revenue guidance of down 10% to 15% versus first quarter 2019. This outlook is in line where we were in the fourth quarter, but we are currently expecting a step change in improvement in March. As far as our other initiatives, new fare product remains on track for deployment by midyear, and the new revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. And lastly, we\u2019re in the process of adjusting our published flight schedules in March through May in order to further support the operations and adjust to available staffing trends. The result of this exercise, combined with the flight cancellations we have experienced so far this month, is a three-point reduction in first quarter 2022 capacity from down 6% to down 9% compared with the first quarter 2019. And for full year 2022, as Tammy mentioned, it\u2019s a 4-point reduction from roughly flat to down 4% compared with the full year 2019. Our flight schedules remain subject to further adjustments, if needed. But while this is a slight delay to our previous capacity plan, we still have time to get back on track. As of March 2022, we are roughly 75% restored based on trips, and we continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our route network by the end of 2023. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Van de Ven : Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. Our people did face quite a bit of adversity in 2021, and I just am really proud of their tremendous finish to the year, and they\u2019ve built quite a bit of momentum thus far into 2022. As we\u2019ve all said, we\u2019ve moderated or we began moderating our capacity in the fourth quarter to provide more staffing cushion in the environment. But at the same time, we knew we had some peak holiday travel periods over Thanksgiving and Christmas through the New Year\u2019s time frame, and we really did jump up our daily trips. And we needed all hands on deck to those periods, and we incented folks, and we urge them or those that were willing to pick up open time or voluntarily work on their days off with premium pay. And that certainly worked. Our people really responded. So, if you exclude the day of Thanksgiving, we averaged about 3,500 trips a day during that Thanksgiving holiday period, and that was up roughly 320 trips a day above the weeks leading into Thanksgiving. And our on-time performance for that period was 87%, and that was better than our five-year average. So, we ran a similar play over the Christmas holiday, and our daily trips there increased to roughly 3,600 a day. And again, our people responded. So normally, during the Christmas holiday, we deal with weather, but this year, we also saw the beginning of a sudden and the surging spike in COVID cases. And because we had those people to pitch in to pick up extra shifts during that week of Christmas, we had a completion factor of 99.2%, and we had less than 1% of our flights canceled in the face of that COVID surge. All told, we ended up the fourth quarter with an on-time performance of 72.6%, mainly due to some of the challenges we faced in October. That\u2019s certainly not up to our standards. We must do better, and we will. But our holiday performances were very good, and we know that we can operate in our peak travel days when everyone is available. So, we really have momentum to build on. So, in contrast to those previous holiday periods, January started in the face of severe weather and this Omicron variant spreading rapidly. And as Bob mentioned, we had roughly 2.5 times the number of employees with COVID cases for Omicron than we did with Delta. And we had roughly 5,000 employees become sick in the first three weeks of January. And so, the biggest impacts were in terms of flight cancellations for the period of time, the first week of January, January 1 through January 7. And that week, we canceled roughly 3,800 flights. About 1,900 of those were for weather, and about 1,600 of those were for staffing. And then, our on-time performance of that period was 41.5%. So, we reinstated the incentive pay program to encourage again those who would come in and pick up extra shifts and help cover the flight schedule. And again, the response was superb. We got all that implemented. And so, from January 9th through the 25th, our on-time performance jumped to almost 87%, and that leads the industry for marketing carriers, and the incentive pay program runs through February 8. We\u2019re also benefiting from a decline in our employees that were sidelined due to COVID. Our case counts peaked in that first week of January. And just by way of example, we had over 700 pilots and 1,500 flight attendants that were able to work in that time frame. And thus, the incentive program to help cover those that were out. Those COVID numbers have dropped substantially since then to roughly 100 to 150 people for each group, and that\u2019s a lot closer to what we originally expected. Next, we continue to aggressively hire. Bob mentioned that getting staffed is one of our key objectives of 2022. We also want to make progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency metrics. And then a lot of ways, those go hand in hand as we\u2019re not operating at optimal levels today, nor is our network restored to where we want to be relative to 2019. For the over 8,000 employees that we intend to hire this year, about 40% of them are fly crews, about 40% of them are ground operations. So, it\u2019s very heavily operations-focused to support the schedule this year and beyond as we resume the growth. As we restore the route network this year into 2023, that should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage. And we\u2019re also working on other initiatives to improve efficiencies. Of course, we\u2019ve got the fleet modernization cost initiative, but we\u2019re also working on things like enhancing our turn times, which are already the best in the industry; expanding self-service options for our customers; and investing in daily schedule management tools, which will help us manage regular operations more efficiently. So, we\u2019ve got many items in our technology and process improvement pipeline in order to support our low-cost position within the industry and improve our overall efficiency and our resilience. Just in closing, as we move forward into 2022, we have an exceptional order book for the fleet with its economics and its flexibility. We have new technology foundations in place for our maintenance and our airport systems. We have a laser focus on getting staffed and running a reliable operation. And we\u2019re building an operations modernization portfolio of initiatives that I touched on. And our employees have sacrificed. They\u2019ve worked hard through a challenging and ever-changing environment. And I think that positioned us well to carry this January momentum through the first quarter and beyond. So, I am immensely grateful for the grit, their determination and, of course, their care for our customers. And so, with that, Ryan, back to you. Ryan Martinez : Well, thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up. So Chad, if you please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just quickly, Gary, when I first met you back at Kidder Peabody, I could not have been less relevant, but you showed me just as much respect as you did to the Glenn Angles and Kevin Murphys and Sam Buttricks of that era. And it really meant a lot to me, and it gave me the confidence to continue on my career trajectory. And I just wanted to thank you for that. I will sincerely miss speaking to you on these calls, but I do look forward to hopefully being a thorn in Bob\u2019s side. Gary Kelly : I would expect nothing less. Jamie Baker : Okay, good. I\u2019ll start with Tammy, though. So, Tammy, you emphasized that your cost outlook does envision higher wage rates, but I had asked you about that at Investor Day. And at the time, you said you weren\u2019t accruing for new labor contracts. I think I probably got my wires crossed. Could you just clarify that there\u2019s something for new union contracts in your forward cost guide. Is that accurate? Tammy Romo : Yes. And thanks, Jamie, and I appreciate the question there. So yes, we are not currently accruing for open labor contract today. So, we are not accruing for that, so there is nothing in our first quarter guidance. Longer term, though, we have incorporated our best estimate of annual labor rate increases into all of our targets. So, here -- and then here, just to be clear, for 2022, we know we have some inflation here. So, we\u2019re doing our very best to incorporate what we think we\u2019re going to incur here in 2022. So, hopefully, that clears that up for you. Jamie Baker : It does. Thank you very much. And any update on the fourth fare rung that you intend to load this spring? Are you still on track? If you\u2019re not ready to disclose, what it includes? Could you share any ideas that maybe you ruled out from a pricing perspective? Andrew Watterson : Hi Jamie, it\u2019s Andrew answering your question. We\u2019re still on track for a midyear rollout of that. We\u2019re going through right now the technology user acceptance, and it\u2019s all going well. We expect this to be above one to get away, so we\u2019ve ruled out taking away features from customers and charging them more. These will be features that are in addition to want to get away for which we believe customers will happily pay a little bit extra. We also believe these features will be relevant to business travelers, especially some small and medium-sized business travelers. So, that\u2019s how we want to position it versus, say, the fair product just above and just below it. Does that answer your question? Jamie Baker : It does indeed. Thank you very much. Yes, that will be it. I\u2019m sure a lot of accolades coming for Gary. So, I get the punch here. Take care. Operator : And the next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. I don\u2019t actually have any ancient Wall Street history. But I did want to ask you, Gary, if you received any calls from music producers since you dropped your recent tribute. Gary Kelly : We\u2019ve always been very circumspect about confidential information here, so I\u2019m going to have to decline to answer your question. Duane Pfennigwerth : Fair enough. I wish you well on that journey. With respect to the 4-point cut to full year capacity, is that all about the rate of demand improvement in first half, or was any of that a function of kind of looking at the operation and deciding you needed even more buffer on staffing? Tammy Romo : Yes. I\u2019ll jump in, and Andrew and others may want to chime in. But no, we -- it really was more about adjusting, being a little more cautious with regard to our operations. Obviously, Omicron had a significant impact on us here in the first quarter, so just we felt that it was prudent to take some capacity out. And as we have stabilized the operation and as you\u2019ve heard us comment here, we\u2019re doing a great job in that respect with really an outstanding performance here over the last couple of days. Andrew Watterson : The only thing I\u2019d add to what Tammy said is it was designed to make it more offerable and get cushion to the operation, so that\u2019s both how much we\u2019re flying but also where we\u2019re flying, given the -- some of our ground-based staffing shortages. So, the combination of those two were the crux of it. Obviously, we look at demand when we\u2019re making those adjustments, but the motivation here was operational reliability. Gary Kelly : Yes. The only thing I would add too is that the -- it\u2019s all the gas, right, at this point. So, we\u2019re making our best guess based on -- we have terrific staffing plans. I\u2019m confident we will meet those here in 2022. If we get ahead of those, we -- obviously, we preserve the ability to sort of work on our capacity on the other end in the back end of 2022. We just don\u2019t know yet. But yes, it\u2019s really all due to staffing at this point. We\u2019ve got to run a reliable operation. We\u2019ve got to have enough staff cushion. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then, you mentioned it with ground handling, but I wonder if you could provide some anecdotes of where you know today, you\u2019re obviously overstaffed from a longer-term perspective. What are some of the functions beyond ground handling? Where you\u2019re keeping actively deciding to keep a higher buffer and where predictability is just not there yet? Gary Kelly : Yes, I might separate sort of the experience at the beginning of January and then the rest of the year as we had a really rapid rise in COVID cases in the first couple of weeks of January. You had an overall Southwest Airlines impact operationally and then you had very locational impacts. An example would be the Denver ramp. We had a rapid rise in our Denver cases on the Denver ramp, and we literally had to quickly moderate the Denver schedule to be able to operate there. But I think it\u2019s really -- the overall adjustments to capacity is really all groups. We need pilots, we need flight attendants, we need ramp staffing, and you need the appropriate amount of buffer in all of those areas until we sort of see our way past COVID and understand what more normalized staffing, more normalized behaviors, more normalized sick leave looks like. So, I would argue, we -- it\u2019s really not one group. We have buffer -- we\u2019re looking for buffer in all of those groups. Operator : And the next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Yes. Reiterate to you, Gary, you\u2019re a legend, man. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Thank you for keeping it interesting over the years. I had a question for you. And it\u2019s -- I\u2019d love to get your parting thoughts on the industry\u2019s outlook over the next two to three years. It\u2019s not a question about Southwest. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re leaving the Company in a good position to compete and win and succeed. But as someone that\u2019s made a lot of good predictions over the years, what is your view, your sort of parting view on how the industry unfolds competitively whatever growth-wise over the next two to three years? Gary Kelly : Well, thanks, Hunter. Well, I don\u2019t know how good of a prognosticator I\u2019ve ever been or I don\u2019t think I\u2019m myself that way. I do think that if you compare the U.S. to other countries, the U.S. has left the commercial airline industry in pretty darn good shape. And were it not for the CARES Act, I think we\u2019d be having a very different conversation. So, I think it\u2019s just important to acknowledge that upfront. Having said that, there are still significant variations. So, when you talk about the industry, it\u2019s hard to think about it that way because there\u2019s strong and there\u2019s weak. There are strong balance sheets, there are weak balance sheets. And I think what we\u2019ve experienced in 2021 is really humbling. A year ago, and you and I haven\u2019t talked in a while, but I think everyone I\u2019ve run into where we had the sort of video tape replayed, I would have never bet a year ago that this is where we would be here in early 2022. I thought we would have this pandemic beat and behind us, and it\u2019s far from that. So, I think that just sort of provides the same and even bigger quandary now, which is where we think we\u2019re going to be with the pandemic two years from now. We were honoring a former Dallas Mayor earlier this week, and he and I were having the exact same conversation, and his guess was 10 years. We\u2019re going to be dealing with this for 10 years. So, I think that has a direct correlation with travel, tourism, hospitality, restaurants, all of that. We just have to be -- we need to hope for the best, plan for the worst, is sort of the age-old advice that we\u2019ve all gotten. It does feel like business travel wants to come back, and I think that\u2019s encouraging. We were hoping for a stronger business travel here in Jan-Feb than what we\u2019re realizing. We all know why that hasn\u2019t happened. So just again, a perfect example. But I think the industry is pretty darn well capitalized. It\u2019s taken on a lot of debt, which is going to have to be carefully managed. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to have to be more heavily dependent on consumer travel than where we were before. I think international also kind of fits into that category of it\u2019s probably different in the future than it has been in recent history, and we\u2019ll just have to be prepared to be more successful domestically over the next couple of years. But in my opinion, and that\u2019s why I put it in my remarks, I think it\u2019s the best service, and the lowest price wins. And if you have that combination within the industry, you\u2019re going to win. I think it is a low-cost gain always, but I think that\u2019s even more acutely important right now, and that will be a laser focus for our leadership team certainly for the next couple of years. Hunter Keay : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, I asked you this question about a year ago, Gary, but, you are a never-say-never guy if there was anything you\u2019d never say never to. I guess, the same question goes for Bob. Is there anything that we can expect that you would say you\u2019d never do as CEO or Southwest would never do as long as you\u2019re running the Company? Bob Jordan : There\u2019s some easy things here. We\u2019re not going to charge for bags. We\u2019re not going to have change fees. I mean, we\u2019re going to state we\u2019re going to always be transparent. We\u2019re going to be open and honest with our consumers. Now, things change over the years for sure. In my 34 years here at Southwest. We\u2019ve changed our boarding. We\u2019ve changed some of our product. We\u2019ve added WiFi. We\u2019ve added Rapid Rewards program. So, things always change, but we\u2019re always going to lean to our customers. So yes, I think the number one thing that comes to mind, obviously, is no bag fees, no change fees. The other thing is not going to change, we\u2019re going to treat our employees right; we\u2019re going to treat our customers right; and we\u2019re going to stand for service; and we\u2019re going to stand for serving others before ourselves. Hunter Keay : Thank you very much. Congratulations, Gary. Operator : The next question will be from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thank you very much, operator. Yes, Gary, I\u2019m going to miss you as well. In fact, I remember our first meeting when you tell me and me were sitting in my office at Lehman Brothers. And it just seems like we\u2019re too young to retire, and I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do with your free time going forward, although maybe not so much free time that you\u2019ll have. Thank you actually for everything. And then, separate from that, my question is really, not sure who wants to answer, has to do with the credit card program. Is there a way for Chase to separate out for you the -- the charges that come for travel and the airline versus charges that come for stuff? Because as you think about going forward, the percentage of stuff should decline as people have their pelotons and their computers and all the other stuff they bought during the pandemic, and they should start to shift back to travel. So, I\u2019m wondering if Chase can parse that out for you and if you can gain any intelligence from that. Andrew Watterson : Helane, it\u2019s Andrew. Yes, as part of our relationship with Chase, we do receive that on a regular basis, and we review it on a regular basis. And indeed, as you probably would have seen through macroeconomic indicators, charges during the pandemic skewed towards goods and less towards services. And then, the services would also mirror the pandemic, and we could see when restaurants were more active with our card members or flights activity as well. And so, that is something that I think tracks very well with what you see in the macroeconomics. When you have it sort of in a high-frequency basis like this, when we see it a bit earlier, that does help us with understanding the pace and duration of these waves. So, it\u2019s been very useful for us, and we expect a skew towards services going forward, which obviously would be beneficial to our industry. Helane Becker : Right. So, you would expect that the rate of growth would, what, accelerate with services or decelerate? Andrew Watterson : I think it would accelerate. Given the composition of people spend, services are underweight now versus what they were in 2019. And given the customers have very good balance sheets themselves, the stimulus program has put a lot of cash in people\u2019s pockets, and so they have some pent-up demand of potential expenditures above and beyond. They\u2019re kind of normal salary-based or compensation-based spending. And so, we expect that composition to revert back more to normal as we would get past the pandemic, whatever that might be, as Gary pointed out. So therefore, services spending on our card and economies as a whole should increase as the health crisis abates. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then, on the constraining spring capacity due to labor constraints, would you be able to offset that with pricing? Tammy Romo : Helane, I\u2019ll jump in on that. Obviously, we don\u2019t comment on pricing. So, we -- as always, we\u2019re going to work hard to achieve our financial objectives, but we\u2019ll decline to comment specifically on pricing. Bob Jordan : And I might just point you to -- back to the fourth quarter, which is we had -- I think we had a really strong performance, revenue, pricing, fare, yield. So we -- I think on sort of my memory is that it was 92% or so of capacity restored. We had 88% of revenues restored, which is leading in the industry. And yields and fares were just slightly below 2019. So not speaking to your direct question, but just if you look at the fourth quarter, we had a very strong revenue performance. Helane Becker : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks everybody. And bye, Gary. It\u2019s very sad. Operator : And the next question will come from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Linenberg : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Gary, it goes without saying, I mean, you\u2019re going to be missed. And to be on a Southwest conference call without Gary Kelly, it\u2019s going to -- we\u2019re going to get used to it, but Bob is the right guy. In that regard, I do want to ask you one final question on a call. In your new role -- or I should say new role, but as your continuing role on the Board, will you still dress up for Halloween? Gary Kelly : I don\u2019t think anybody can stop me. So, that was one of my pure joys in life, and I do have grandchildren who get a kick out of it, so. But, it\u2019s all about me. I really enjoy dressing up. Mike Linenberg : That\u2019s great to hear. So, Gene Simmons will live on through Gary Kelly. Gary Kelly : Yes. He\u2019ll live on. And he\u2019s still my pal, so. Mike Linenberg : That\u2019s awesome. All right. Well, on to a more serious topic here. I just -- I want to go back to the capacity change for 2022. I mean -- and I guess, Tammy, this is to you, where -- for the March quarter, you\u2019re shaving 3 points. But for the full year, you\u2019re cutting 4 points, and it\u2019s obviously having a tremendous upward pressure on your full year unit cost. And you did highlight that the June quarter looks like it\u2019s going to take obviously a big cut there. But as I think about the math, it just seems like that you are taking a lot out. You did say you\u2019re being cautious. It\u2019s all about returning operations, returning the integrity of the operations back to a normalcy. It does feel like it\u2019s extra conservative, or are you -- is that down 4% for the year, assume that you\u2019re not going to exercise the 37 remaining options. Can you just give some additional color there? Just it seems sizable. Tammy Romo : Sure. I\u2019ll give some color here, and then we may have some other chime in here. But yes, we -- I guess, we haven\u2019t given up here on adding additional capacity in the second quarter. Again, we\u2019re just going to have to see how things go here on the staffing front. And obviously, as we\u2019ve already said, our priority is on the operations. But, wherever we end up with regard to our capacity for the full year, at least at this point in time, we intend to exercise all of our remaining options. And the reason for that is really straightforward, Mike, we have a really strong NPV on those aircraft either way. Obviously, we hope that we\u2019re putting those into growing the network, either in 2022 or 2023. But we have a lot of flexibility here, and the fact is we just don\u2019t have to decide right now. So, if we do not have a need for those in the network, we would just simply retire and accelerate the retirements of our -700. So, we\u2019re in the -- we\u2019ve got a good fortune here of having tremendous flexibility, which was by design when we work through our order book with Boeing. Bob Jordan : And Mike, I would just add, too, that this is all forecast. If you look at look at Omicron and how quickly we have adjusted, I think my memory is our network planning team is doing 2 or 3 times the number of changes that they would typically. And so, while we\u2019ve got a great plan for \u201822, it all comes down to hiring. And I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re on our hiring plans for the fall, and we\u2019re on our hiring plan so far for January. But, in the case that we were able to beat those, we\u2019ve got up -- you\u2019d have some upside, but we\u2019ll just continue to adjust. I think, if you look at our fleet today, again, because we are flying and therefore our ASMs are constrained based on our staffing, you probably have 5% to 6% of the fleet that is effectively unflown. In other words, we could be generating 5% to 6% more ASMs with the current fleet but for the staffing. So, we\u2019ll work really hard to make progress there, and so I wouldn\u2019t call that -- we\u2019ve got a great plan, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a year done yet in terms of capacity. Mike Linenberg : Okay. So, it\u2019s very fluid. And then just, Bob, I guess just as a quick follow-up, and this follows on Hunter\u2019s sort of that never-say-never. You did mention change fees. You talked about bags. I think I saw about a week or two ago, there was something about seat assignments. But again, it may have been a reporter putting words in your mouth. Anything that you can highlight with respect to that? Maybe it was a misinterpretation. Bob Jordan : No. A reporter would never put words in your mouth, right? No, it was just an illustration. I was sort of going through the kinds of things that, over time, I think you have a duty to look at, just like we have a duty to -- mike talked about our operational tools. We have a duty to look at our customer experience and how to enhance that. And at some point, I think just like we did years and years ago, we will probably want to resurrect the work that we did there and just understand what our customers prefer, what our business customers prefer, what that does to the efficiency of the operation. So there was no prediction at all. It was just an example of the types of things that you do have to take a look at over time. Operator : The next question will be from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Savi Syth : Just kind of curious on the managed business revenues. I know you kind of talked about expecting a step change in March. But how does kind of the trends you\u2019re seeing today compared to how you exited the year? And just any color on how much that is getting boosted by some of the GDS initiatives that you\u2019ve rolled out? Andrew Watterson : Sure. This is Andrew. I\u2019ll start off by saying we see that managed business travel like our overall travel fluctuate with COVID wave. So there will be a period of time early in the wave where cancellations surge and then bookings slow down. And then the next part of that is as cases and hospitalization start to come down the backside, we see those cancellations attenuate and bookings pick up. So we\u2019re on the backside of that -- the bookings right now for managed business. And so we can see then that if we go back on its trend that we saw throughout 2021, where buff is ups and downs, you were on a solid trend from January through December. Now with regards to our initiatives, we can see that we are having a shift of travel from our previous channels to the GDS, but we also can see those incremental on top of that. Now because COVID has created such a disruption in travel patterns, we don\u2019t want to extrapolate and give final numbers on that, but we already see that we are achieving our business case. And it is causing some channel shift, but that was all part of our plan to be able to offer our corporate customers the choice of the channel from which they want to buy with Southwest Airlines. Savi Syth : Makes sense. And just curious, some -- shifting gears a little bit, on the regional airline side, you had some of your legacy competitors cut a lot of small markets. Regional airlines are struggling a little bit from a piloting standpoint as well as some of the kind of the 5G issues. Curious if you\u2019re seeing a benefit given that Southwest to fly into some of the smaller markets than you see some ULCCs flying, if you\u2019re seeing any benefit from maybe this kind of capacity that\u2019s being constrained. Andrew Watterson : Well, I can certainly read about their unfortunate situation. However, the COVID wave is such a predominant force in bookings right now, it\u2019s really hard to tease out a lot of other trends within that. And so right now, as Bob and Tammy mentioned, we\u2019re managing our network for our customers and our employees, and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re aiming at. And so we don\u2019t really kind of look outside of our lane, so to speak, to what\u2019s going with others to be opportunistic because right now. We\u2019re just trying to keep ourselves good stable operation and achieve our financial goals. Savi Syth : All right. And then Gary, I\u2019d like to echo a lot of the comments that have been shared on this call and wish you the best. Thanks. Operator : And the next question will be from David Vernon from Bernstein. David Vernon : I wonder if you can give us an update on where you are with Boeing on getting the MAX 7 certified. And as you look out over the next 2, 3 years, obviously, there\u2019s 136 from orders 60 or so more options, how do we think about retirement expectations in relation to that? Should we be thinking that as these aircraft are going in, you\u2019re going to be retiring or getting rid of some of the older classics? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. So David, this is Mike. So we\u2019ve got about 450-ish, 700, and so at least half of our order book will probably be focused on replacing those airplanes. Boeing is telling us that they\u2019re targeting ATC for the MAX 7 by the end of the first quarter. Of course, that\u2019s contingent on the FAA review process, which is a little bit different for airplanes after the MAX grounding. Once they get that type certificate, it will take us about 7 months or we\u2019re planning on about 7 months to be able to bring that airplane on our operating certificate. So we\u2019ll need to do things like get performance data from Boeing for the airplane, ingest that performance data into our systems, do all the quality assurance work on that, update our manuals and then get our own CMO to approve our manuals before we can add the airplane to our ops spec. So we\u2019ve just got -- we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility in that order book. Boeing is a very good partner with us. And so we still expect to take the 114 airplanes at this point, but we may not be flying the MAX 7 until early 2023. David Vernon : That\u2019s very, very helpful. And Andrew, maybe just as a quick follow-up. I\u2019m assuming that despite the lack of business travel, the selling efforts on the corporate side have been continuing through the pandemic. Is there any color you can give to us in terms of how GDS enrollment has impacted your traction in terms of like the number of corporate units you have or the win rate in bid process? Anything you can give us to help us gauge kind of how effective this is going to be in terms of the -- continuing for corporate share going forward would be really helpful. Andrew Watterson : Certainly, I\u2019ll try to give you some color. You can also look in the ARC data because we went in the GDS, but also settled into ARC, so you can track for yourself what we\u2019re selling in ARC as well. But if you look at our accounts, even going before going into the GDS, especially going to Sabre, we had built up our corporate sales force, and in anticipation of this and our overall effort had increased the number of our accounts like we shared at Investor Day. Now these accounts, they buy through multiple channels already. Some may be 100% 1 channel. But today, you take our largest corporate clients, and they will buy through SWABIZ, they will buy through our Direct Connect and now they\u2019ll buy through GDS as well. It depends on the travel purpose as well as the subsidiary or a population group within that company of how they buy it. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re letting them move in between. And we do see some like the government moving pretty strongly towards some GDS transactions. We see professional services not really abandoning some of the first 2, the Direct Connect and the SWABIZ and adding on GDS on top of it. So it really depends on the travel purpose and on the corporation as to which channel they prefer, which is the thesis of our strategy of let the customer choose and get out of the way and stop having friction. And so as I mentioned earlier, the COVID waves really scramble a lot of trends, so you can\u2019t be as precise as you would be in normal times. But at the highest level, we do see incremental volume we\u2019re getting, and we\u2019re hearing from corporate that they are giving us incremental volume when we speak of it because of these channels. David Vernon : And Gary, thanks for all the time, and congratulations on the move up. Operator : We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Gary, I echo those comments and congratulations. Maybe if I could ask about the bottleneck in terms of ramping capacity from \u201822 and \u201823, it seems like a lot of the industry has faced supply constraints rather than demand constraints, especially domestically. How do you think about Southwest overcoming those challenges you take on 200 aircraft or so? And I understand maybe half of those are for replacement. Gary Kelly : Well, I\u2019ll jump in and start and you all can add. So in 2021, we made some assumptions about the operating environment that we would be in and the environment that people would live in. And it was just clear to us as we went through this Delta variant that, that environment was not appropriate, and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time in 2021 reacting to that caused our crews to be rescheduled. It caused regular operations, and we had a reliability challenge for the airline. Our approach in 2022 really is to just accept that the environment that we\u2019re in currently might be the environment that we\u2019re in for a while and go ahead and plan the airline and staff the airline like that. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing with respect to the capacity adjustments here in 2022, is just making the assumption that let\u2019s still assume things are going to get better until they actually do. So we have a very aggressive plan to go hire people. I think our wage rate increases, especially in the front line for the ground, will help us accelerate our staffing. I think we\u2019ll have plenty of access to pilots and flight attendants. So I feel good that our staffing plan is going to come to fruition. And then the question just is, as we bring the people on and we mitigate the premium pay, we mitigate some of the regular operations, we run a more stable operation, can we -- will we see different behaviors? And if we do, that gives us upside. Bob Jordan : Well, and Sheila, you add back just sort of what\u2019s the constraint. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was all about managing down your capacity because of demand. Demand fell 97% and then stayed down 70% for a long time, so it was all about managing to lower demand. Well, that\u2019s not where we are today, again. Sort of back to the fourth quarter, we had stronger -- obviously, strong revenue, strong yields, strong fares, strong demand overall. And that\u2019s when business demand down 50%. So very strong leisure. In my mind, leisure has returned to 2019. Obviously, that was interrupted by Omicron, but I\u2019m confident that the leisure demand is restored. And we just need to get the staffing levels to the point where we can operate our aircraft, operate them reliably, produce the kind of operational performance that our customers need and want and deserve, and it\u2019s just going to take staffing to do that. And obviously, that staffing in a strong labor market, which is why you saw us raise our starting wages. But no, to me, the moderation is all about staffing, not because of any concern over demand. And so then again, you layer on to the fourth quarter, the 50% recovery in business continues to recover in 2022, and we\u2019re hopeful that it recovers by the end of the year to, say, down 10 to 20. I think we\u2019ll have plenty of demand. It\u2019s all about getting the hiring to restore the capacity. Ryan Martinez : All right. Any last thoughts before we wrap up? Gary Kelly : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I just wanted to acknowledge all the kind comments from everyone. I\u2019m very appreciative of that. And some of the old-timers that caused me to reminisce. When I started as CFO, it was 1989, and in those days, we didn\u2019t do this. I talked -- I was Investor Relations, and Tammy is laughing because I had to beg her 5 years into this to come bail me out. But I did the Investor Relations. We had the CFO, we had a controller, and we had a Treasurer. And we\u2019re cheap now, but we were really cheap then. So we had one assistant that supported all 3 of us, and I did the Investor Relations. So we would send out -- we had this auto fax system, where we would fax out the press releases. And then some of you would be really angry with us because you were at the bottom of the fax list, which meant that you were -- I don\u2019t know how long this damn thing took, but it was not instantaneous. We\u2019ll put it that way. And then I would talk to each analyst individually on the phone. And then when I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I said -- I begged Tammy to come over from leading financial reporting to come to Investor Relations. She was the very first Investor Relations professional in the history of Southwest Airlines, and she modernized all of the things that we enjoy today. It took a while for her to beat that in to me, but she eventually did. The other thing you caused me to reminisce on is Tammy, who was and is a star, she moved on to other jobs and hired Marcy. And then Marcy moved on to other jobs and now we hired Ryan, and that\u2019s pretty remarkable. In a 33 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ve only had 3 people, 3 different people leading Investor Relations. So I\u2019m very proud of you guys. And I -- and for all my friends here, I will tell you, and I\u2019ve told all my Southwest colleagues this, I learned more from doing Investor Relations than I learned going to school. And the questions that you all have, the ideas, the way you challenge me, at least over the years, has been invaluable, and not to mention the very rich friendships that we had. Helane will remember, and this -- I think I was a controller at the time in the late \u201880s, we would do a show at the big Shearson Lehman Hutton investor conference, which was multi days. And people would come, they would stay for days. And then Southwest, we put on this Broadway-like parody of the industry. We pick on Frank Lorenzo especially, who\u2019s a good friend of mine, by the way, and Crandall and others. But Helane, I remember the first year that you came on working for Bob Joedicke. We parodied you, and we had an actor walk across the stage. I don\u2019t remember the song, but we had -- we anointed Helane Miss Shearson Lehman Hutton because she added a lot of glamour the sales side analyst community to this day. But in any event, I\u2019m very grateful for the friendships, very blessed to have been in a really great company for 36 years. And I just heard this morning that Parker was retiring in March. And I didn\u2019t translate that into, well, that means that this is his last analyst call. And I was told that he reported that he\u2019s done between being CEO and CFO 107 of these quarterly things. And I did the math on mine, and I want every one of you to know that it\u2019s 134 for me. So not that I\u2019m keeping score with Parker, but I will leave you all with that and leave Southwest Airlines in great hands. And as you all know, I\u2019m not going anywhere. We\u2019ve got lots of work to do, and I\u2019m going to be here doing my little part. So Ryan, thank you very much. Back to you, sir. Ryan Martinez : Well, that\u2019s fantastic. Thank you for sharing. Of course, you are a legend, and I think you\u2019re the GOAT. Not a goat, but the GOAT. Sign off here, and that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. We can go ahead and get started with the media portion of our call today. I just want to welcome everyone. And you can go ahead, Chad, if you want to just give them instructions to get queued up and we\u2019ll get started. . Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Kyle Arnold : I was wondering with those 5,000 COVID calls that you had in -- are all of those individuals being sick themselves? Are you guys seeing much fallout from family members or from schools being closed, daycare, those kind of other hiccups that we\u2019re seeing in the economy? Gary Kelly : Kyle, those were all people that had -- were tested positive for COVID themselves. They weren\u2019t not coming to work because of some family issues. They tested positive and reported the positive COVID to us. Bob Jordan : And Kyle, the good thing, too, is the -- different than Delta, the cases came on really quickly. So the rise was alarming. But on the other side, the fall in the cases was similar. So the wave was very narrow, which was painful on the front end, helpful on the back end because we got people back a lot faster than Delta. Tammy Romo : One thing, but no doubt, everything that you mentioned, Kyle, I\u2019m sure we were incurring to. It\u2019s just been an incredibly challenging time for everyone. So all the additional demands that households have now, I\u2019m sure impacted that, which is be it caring for a sick spouse or child or a school closure or just dealing with everyday live. So I think that would be on top of the numbers that we shared with you. Operator : The next question will be from Leslie Joseph from CNBC. Leslie Joseph : With your hiring for 2022, I was wondering how much of those -- how many of those people are replacing other workers? And net, where do you expect to end up in headcount by the end of the year? And overall, do you expect salaries to be lower than 2019 before the pandemic junior workers are coming in? Gary Kelly : So mostly, the 8,000 number that you hear, that would be the net increase in our full-time active equivalent employees. And then one of the benefits that you do get from hiring people is you do get to average down the scale increases in the contract. And we\u2019ve got about, like I said earlier, about 40% of that group will be flat cruise, 40% will be ground-ops. All of those are covered work groups, and so I do think we\u2019ll have an opportunity on our wage rates as we have newer people come in to average those down. I haven\u2019t looked and see what that means exactly as compared to 2019, and we\u2019ll just -- that\u2019s a good question. Bob Jordan : And Leslie, I think... Leslie Joseph : Okay. And then overall, your -- sorry, go ahead. Bob Jordan : Yes, one thing embedded in your question maybe, and then just the numbers on the totals, I think maybe you were implying so what -- is it an add and what\u2019s happening to attrition? Our attrition is up -- during COVID, our attrition is up modestly, but it\u2019s not up alarmingly, which is a good thing. But sort of back to the numbers, I think we\u2019re ending -- we ended \u201821 at roughly 55,000 active employees. You add the 8,000 plus, and so the plan would be to end 2022 at about 63,000, 64,000 active. . Operator : The next question will come from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I think we\u2019ve probably asked about this pretty much every quarter, but just curious what you\u2019re hearing or what you\u2019re picking up about the mask mandate, the likelihood it would get extended. Yes, just curious how you\u2019re seeing that playing out in a couple of months. Gary Kelly : Alison, well, yes, I don\u2019t believe there is any current discussion about extending or terminating the mask mandate, right? I think it\u2019s well established that once you\u2019re onboard the aircraft, the environment is very healthy with the continuous air refresh. Adding the mask is an added layer of safety. And given the fact that we\u2019re right in the midst of this Omicron surge, now is not really the time to revisit that question in our opinion. And I think that\u2019s representative of the A4A opinion as well. We survey our customers, and there are -- there\u2019s still a significant number of customers who feel safer with the mask. There\u2019ll come a time when the mask won\u2019t be necessary. I think we all look forward to that, but right now is not the right time. Alison Sider : And I guess if I could ask about hiring and kind of the challenging labor market. In addition to the minimum wage increase, just curious if there\u2019s anything else you are doing? I know last year, you talked about kind of making on the spot offers and doing all these stop fares. Are you -- are there any other kind of creative tactics here having to utilize to bring in all these people? Bob Jordan : Yes, Alison, I think in the current tough environment, you use every lever that you have. And so obviously, you\u2019ve seen us move our starting wage rates along from sort of where they were to 15 to 17. And some airports, there were even 20 at this point. We\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s worked very hard on the processes. So how can you take steps out of the process? So if it took -- I\u2019m just making this up. But if it took 30 days to get from interview to hire, can we get that to 10 or 8? Because the longer that process is, the more you run the risk that, that person takes a job somewhere else. We\u2019re doing instant offers in some cases, as you mentioned. We\u2019re using different techniques to get people \"into the funnel of hiring\". So a lot of social media, a lot of mining for information. So I would just tell you, we\u2019re using every lever out there because, I mean, Southwest is a wonderful company. We are -- we get our share of resumes and interest, but it\u2019s just tougher than normal one. So we\u2019re turning over every rock in terms of what we can do to hire employees. And a lot of that is, yes, it\u2019s about pay and it\u2019s about pace. Operator : And the next question will be from Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Gary, you mentioned 1989, and I sound a little bit like Jamie Baker here. But I\u2019m in possession of a Gary Kelly, Vice President of Finance business card. I\u2019m wondering maybe I can monetize it through an NFT or something. I wanted to wish you well. Gary Kelly : Thank you, Dawn. I remember all the rough interviews I had to suffer through with you. So thanks for all of that. Dawn Gilbertson : A couple of questions here on the traveler front. First, pretty quickly on the March to May flight cuts, could someone put that capacity decrease into the number of daily flights for me and tell me like how much of that business is already on the books? In other words, how many people you\u2019re going to have to notify again about schedule changes? And then more importantly, on the new fare category. Bob, I\u2019m wondering, I think Andrew mentioned we\u2019re not going to take anything away from one to get away. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re willing to go on the record to say, I mean, with something like offering people who buy want to get away 1 bag instead of 2, is that taking something away? And on a related front on that, I\u2019m trying to figure out what could you guys add that you don\u2019t always have? And my mind goes to early boarding. So are you considering adding early boarding, the EarlyBird fee, to that second fare category? Because I know you -- in some test a couple of years ago, you called it, want to get away plus. And if you do include EarlyBird in this new fare category, would EarlyBird has an ancillary item go away? Gary Kelly : Dawn, I\u2019ll let Andrew come back to the flight count. But you -- so you need to join our marketing team because you probably put everything that we\u2019ve looked at on the table. But no, I\u2019ll just tell you, yes, it\u2019s just too early to give away exactly what -- for a lot of reasons. Competitively, we\u2019re not ready to reveal exactly what that fare product looks like. Andrew is right, we\u2019re not taking anything away. It\u2019s going to be very attractive in terms of where it\u2019s positioned. I think it will be what you would expect from Southwest Airlines in terms of consumer-friendly, but we\u2019re just not ready let you know, but it\u2019s coming soon. Andrew Watterson : And just to double down, we will not take anything away from one to get away. So there\u2019ll be one to get away of something above it, but we will not take anything away want to get away. And for the flight counts, the March flight counts have already been prosecuted, and so those who have already been handled. The April through May have not yet been published, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- we mentioned in the press release and in our conversation that we\u2019re in the process of doing that. So we don\u2019t have a flight count yet to give you on that. Those we expect to have prosecuted in a couple of weeks\u2019 time, so it will be well in advance of travel and be less disruptive. Bob Jordan : But the bookings are that far or pretty much. Andrew Watterson : Yes, bookings that are in COVID generally skew closer in. And so what we have -- that far of the book is modest. So it will be some customers are impacted, but it will be a modest number of customer doing well in advance. Dawn Gilbertson : If I can ask one very quick follow-up on the new fare category. What are you going for there? And I know it will vary by route, et cetera, et cetera. But obviously, this is a revenue initiative you\u2019ve been talking about for a few years. What are you going for in terms of the fare different, average fare differential, between want to get away and whatever this new product is called? And again, best to you, Gary. Andrew Watterson : What we\u2019ve done over the pandemic, if you look at our website, you\u2019ll see more modest step-ups between want to get away at any time and Business Select. And we think that has had a laudatory effect on our revenues, and customers are giving us good feedback. And so we like more modest step-up compared to what was perhaps there a number of years ago. So having a fourth one that comes in there, we would desire to have the end 4 products with modest step-ups in between with features that customers are willing to pay that modest step-up for. So it\u2019s designed to be pro-consumer and get someone who can -- will only give us additional money for additional features. Operator : And the next question will come from David Slotnick from TPG. David Slotnick : Congratulations again, Gary. I wanted to know if there is any update on when you\u2019re planning to bring back full onboard service, including alcohol. Gary Kelly : So we had planned to bring that back around the middle of February, and we ended up because of the Omicron virus. And just making sure that we had enough separation in the cabin for one, we delayed that. And then -- so we\u2019re looking at that here sometime in late in the first quarter, maybe early in the second quarter. Operator : And the next question will come from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I wanted to ask 2 quick questions. The first is you\u2019ve said that over the past year that you hope to add a total of 25,000 workers over 3 years. I wanted to see if you still think that\u2019s a realistic number, if that\u2019s one you will have to increase. And the second question is for Gary. Gary, is there something that you were unable to accomplish in your years as CEO that you would like to see Bob take on and accomplish? Bob Jordan : Well, let me take the -- just take the hiring. And again, sometimes you have to separate gross hiring and net because we always have attrition. But the 8,000 -- as you think about our growth going forward, the 8,000 per year that we\u2019re talking about here for \u201822, I can see that persisting. We\u2019ve got a lot of air into the future, in future years. We\u2019ve got a lot of aircraft coming this year, we\u2019ve got 114 in our plan. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to restore our network back to what it was in 2019. I think, Andrew, we\u2019re roughly 75% restored at this point by memory. There\u2019s a lot of work to do to add back depth after we opened the 18 cities. Beyond that, we have -- I mentioned this in my remarks, we\u2019ve got a lot of growth opportunities. We\u2019re picking up substantial gates in Denver and Phoenix and Baltimore and Nashville and others. And so all of that will take aircraft, and all of that will take employees. So is it exactly 25,000 over 3 years? I can\u2019t tell you that, but it -- you sort of take the 8,000 in 2022 and extrapolate that, and it\u2019s a significant number. Gary Kelly : And Mary, I hadn\u2019t really thought about it the way you asked the question, but it is a wonderful question. I think the -- as we think about Southwest Airlines and year 51, it is so much stronger and better prepared at any point in time in our history. And I think back 18 years ago, it -- we had a lot of challenges. It was post 9/11, and the world was just different. There was a shift from -- away from short-haul travel to longer-haul travel. We weren\u2019t necessarily well prepared for that, and a lot of things needed to be retooled and still retain the essence of Southwest Airlines, which I feel like we\u2019ve been able to do. . The speed of change in today\u2019s world is just faster than it was 20 years ago. And so I would wish for Bob that we have a better technology platform in place compared to 18 years ago that would enable a faster and more tactical like decisions. For us, anything that we wanted to do that was different in the 2000s meant years and millions in terms of construction. So it became a really significant strategic choice about which road you took when you came to the fork. So I think we have a much more settled and stable strategic outlook today, which I know that both of us -- Bob is impatient, and I think that, that\u2019s a good and a bad quality for a CEO. But certainly, he\u2019s urgent and has been a huge contributor, of course, to getting us to this point and laying out the direction that we\u2019re headed. So it\u2019s not like these are new ideas for Bob. He\u2019s been working on this for a long time like I have. I think the one thing that I\u2019m grateful for looking back is that the things that we decided to do, we had a very supportive Board, we had willing and eager employees to embrace the change, and we were able to fulfill the visions that we had. And that\u2019s pretty rare. A lot of things you try, they don\u2019t work. Or for whatever reason, they get derailed. And for us, we were pretty much able to do just about everything we wanted to do. There\u2019s a couple of things that we engage that we set aside. Code sharing is an example that eventually we\u2019ll come back to. But you look at the things that were accomplished, and it\u2019s a pretty mighty list there. So he\u2019ll -- he\u2019s got just as ambitious list going forward. Mike, he\u2019s detailed with a few words, but there\u2019s a lot of depth to what Mike\u2019s strategy is for ops, and it\u2019s just critical to our future. So hats off to the technology and the business leaders who have gotten us to this point. We\u2019re at far better place today than we were then. And I think we\u2019re -- as I said, I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned certainly for the next 5 years and beyond. I\u2019m very excited, and I\u2019m very enthused. And I know Bob is, too. Mary Schlangenstein : Thanks very much, Gary. Good luck going forward. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : And I just wanted to add, Gary, you know that you had many hats to wear in the roles in the last 18 years. And on behalf of the communications team, just really wanted to thank you for being our Chief Spokesperson. You\u2019ve made our jobs easy, and we appreciate and love you. And with that, if you all have any further follow-up for us, you can reach the communications team at (214) 792-4847 or via the media website at www.swamedia.com. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Chad. And thank you all for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. Joining me on the call today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. Just a few reminder that we will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. Also, we had a few special items in our first quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference these non-GAAP results in our remarks. Please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information, our cautionary statement and our non-GAAP reconciliation for more detail. With that Bob, I'll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : Alright. Well, thank you, Ryan. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Well, the first quarter was a tale of two really different environments. As expected, we incurred losses in January and February due to the negative impacts of the Omicron variant. We anticipated travel demand would rebound in March and we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it bounced backand the extent to which demand and booking surged. While we reported a Q1 loss, we were solidly profitable in March, actually not too far off of March 2019\u2019s profit. And while modest, I'm very pleased that first quarter unit revenues increased as compared to 2019. That was the first quarterly increase since the onset of the pandemic. So -- but for the Omicron impact, we estimate that we would have been profitable for the first quarter. In the first quarter, total operating revenues were 91% restored to 2019 levels, despite Q1 managed business revenues being only 45% restored. Looking forward, we're very encouraged with the bookings and revenue trends we're experiencing for Q2, which indicate operating revenues will be fully restored to quarterly record levels on stronger leisure and business demand. Our revenue initiatives continue to roll out and Andrew will cover our new fare product in more detail that we look forward to launching that this quarter and getting another one of our revenue initiatives in place and producing value. We will have another meaningful fuel hedge gain in Q2, and we remain well protected with our fuel hedge portfolio in the second half of this year. Despite higher than normal unit cost inflation and productivity drags from underutilizing our assets, we expect to be solidly profitable for Q2 through Q4 and for the full year 2022. We are currently forecasting a healthy profit for Q2 with solid operating margins. Now, of course, this is based on our current outlook and barring any unforeseen material events, such as another way that would impact or temporarily slow our progress and we see no signs of that at this point. It just goes to show the power of our business model and how well our people are managing through a very difficult environment. Our March results and our current outlook for Q2 represent tremendous progress in our recovery. Even if we aren't fully expected to be optimized with our network fully restored until the end of next year, I'm just really, really proud of our people for their progress to date. We've come a long way, I'm just very thankful for their constant resilience. A key to our recovery is our continued hiring progress. And we now plan to hire and add over 10,000 new employees to the Southwest family this year, and that's negative expected attrition. By the end of this month, we will have welcomed roughly 6,500 new employees in 2022. And that's 5,000 net of attrition. And I'm just really pleased with our hiring progress. We continue to work through lower available staffing, and training constraints to keep pace with rebounding travel demand.And we recently reduced our summer flight schedules to match our capacity guidance as we prioritize our operational reliability. I believe we have already accounted for the impact of staffing constraintsin our full year 2022 guidance on capacity of down 4% versus 2019. But of course, we need to trim work capacity, we certainly can. But I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get to a good balance of headcount to operate our planned flights scheduled for the remainder of the year, while setting ourselves up for resuming more material growth in 2023. You've heard me mention these things before, but we remain focused on a few key priorities for this year : first, getting properly staffed and focusing on our people; second, making progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency; third, providing our legendary hospitality; and fourth, returning to consistent profitability. It will take all 59,000 employees working together to execute on these focus areas and deliver a low-cost, high-quality product with low fares and great customer service. That's what our people are good at, and they've been good at that for 50 years, and they just do an incredible job. It's a tough environment, and they've been through a lot. I'm so grateful for them and what they do each and every day. Together, we're making tremendous progress to put this pandemic behind us. And while coming out of the pandemic has proven to be messy. As it was coming into the pandemic, I can assure you that we are very hard at work here at Southwest Airlines to make this company even stronger, and I remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their resilience in yet another challenging quarter impacted by the pandemic and weather disruptions. The rapid rise of the Omicron variant significantly impacted our business in January and February, resulting in a first quarter net loss of $191 million, excluding special items. March, however, was a much different story as we experienced a rebound in demand and surge in bookings during the month, driving March operating revenues higher in March 2019. This was our first monthly revenue increase relative to respective 2019 levels since the pandemic began. Last month, cash sales also represented a monthly record as bookings surged for spring and summer travel. And we posted healthy double-digit margins for the month of March despite the significant rise in market jet fuel prices. Needless to say, I am excited about the strong revenue trends in second quarter, as Andrew will cover in more detail in a minute. Taking a look at nonfuel cost, we are tracking in line with our 2022 cost plan with first quarter CASM-X coming in at the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 17.9% compared with first quarter 2019. Thankfully, favorable airport settlements, better operational performance in March and lower-than-expected incentive pay created some end period cost relief in first quarter relative to our guidance. As we look ahead, we continue to experience unit cost pressure from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as well as higher inflationary cost pressures, primarily in salaries, wages and benefits. We are leaving our full year CASM-X guidance unchanged at up 12% to 16% versus 2019 as we are still not able to fully utilize our assets or achieve optimal productivity levels due primarily to staffing challenges. That said, we do expect second half 2022 CASM-X growth rate relative to 2019 to ease sequentially from first half 2022. For our second quarter, we currently estimate CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% when compared with 2019 levels. Roughly half of that increase is a result of continued inflationary pressures in both labor and airport rates, which now includes labor rate increases across all work groups as best as we can estimate at this point given the current labor market and our current outlook for profitability this year. We estimate the incremental labor accruals to be roughly 1 point to CASM-X. The remaining half of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal capacity and productivity levels. Our outlook for second quarter capacity remains down approximately 7% from 2019 levels. And while our moderated capacity plans are designed to provide operational relief given our current available staffing challenges, it continues to create unit cost headwinds, particularly with a shorter stage length as we add back higher-frequency business routes, which Andrew will speak to shortly. Turning to fuel. Market prices have been on a rise and highly volatile given the current geopolitical climate. Our fuel hedge is providing excellent protection against rising energy prices and significantly offsets the market price increase in jet fuel in first quarter 2022. We are at 63% hedged for second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $3.05 to $3.15 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.80 higher than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.61 of hedging gain, which represents cost savings of more than $290 million in second quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and heating cracks have been moving pretty materially on a daily basis. By the way, the current energy environment is exactly why we hedge fuel. Even though the hedging gains in the second quarter won't fully offset the rise in market fuel costs, our hedging portfolio is providing meaningful cost mitigation. The fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2022 is estimated at roughly $1 billion. Turning to our fleet. We recently adjusted our order book with Boeing to replace the majority of our -7 MAX firm orders with -8 MAX firm orders in the short term, along with other adjustments, which we outlined in our earnings release this morning. I won't reiterate all the details but will note a few key highlights. Our current order book now reflects 21 -7 firm orders, 81 -8 firm orders and 12 remaining MAX options in 2022. If you recall from our previous order book as of the end of last year, we had no -8 firm orders in 2022. While we are eager to bring the -7 aircraft into our fleet and remain confident in the aircraft, we simply wanted to go ahead and rebound our 2022 order book to provide more near-term certainty given the ongoing certification process for the -7. We are grateful for the flexibility we have in our order book to shift between -7s and -8s and our plans this year to take 114 aircraft delivery and retire 28 -700 remains unchanged. While our CapEx guidance assumes we will exercise the remaining 12 options this year, we maintain flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise each month. And given that the certification for the -7 has been going on for some time, we contemplated the possibility of taking some -8s this year into our 2022 CapEx estimate. Therefore, our CapEx guidance of approximately $5 billion remains unchanged. As I have mentioned before, we don't expect to incur a CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft versus accelerating -700 retirement while our capacity remains temporarily moderated. So from an economic standpoint, we may not decide to accelerate further aircraft retirements this year despite having more aircraft in our fleet than needed for current 2022 capacity plans. We are also mindful of aircraft and growth needs for 2023 as we plan to continue restoring the network. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $15.7 billion. Our leverage is at a very manageable 56%, and we continue to pay down and retire debt as opportunities arise as we have done with a portion of our convertible debt. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. In closing, our second quarter financial trends are strong. Barring any unforeseen events or trend changes, we expect solid second quarter profit and operating margins. Our financial position and ample liquidity allows us to continue investing for the future so that we are ready to resume growth as soon as we are first able to restore our network and get staffing to desired levels. And we intend to grow. We are a growth airline. We have great momentum, and we are excited about the ample opportunities in front of us. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Tammy. I will provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q1, January and February passenger revenues incurred 2 main negative impacts. First, $380 million due to softness in bookings and elevated passenger cancellations attributable to the Omicron variant. And second, an additional $50 million in January due to flight cancellations related to available staffing challenges, which were made worse by winter weather. However, we experienced a very different dynamic in March as we saw a surge in leisure travel and bookings along with a significant pickup in close-in demand. The improvement in March exceeded our original expectations for both leisure and business demand. March managed business revenues were down 36% versus March 2019 compared to our latest guidance of down 40% and put us back on a nice improvement trajectory from pre-Omicron performance in December of 2021. In fact, managed business revenues improved 34 points from January's down 70% to March's down 36%. We experienced higher managed business passengers. And most notably, March marked the first month since the pandemic began where managed business fares surpassed 2019 levels. Our revenue initiatives performed well during Q1 despite the Omicron impact. We saw benefits from our GDS initiative given the significant bounce-back of business demand in March. We also had a strong performance from our loyalty program with other revenue up 43% versus Q1 2019, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. A nice attribute from our new co-brand credit card agreement is that the revenue stream is rather insulated or diversified from the passenger revenue impact from COVID wave as long as consumers' spending remains healthy. And Q1 retail sales spend per cardholder and overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019. Now our new market performance was impacted by the Omicron variant to a greater degree than the rest of our network. While Hawaii growth markets underperformed expectations slightly in March, largely driven by the COVID protocols that have since been lifted, we are encouraged by the strong demand we saw in March and heading into the summer months for Hawaii. We continue to adjust our Hawaii offering to best suit our customers' needs and allocate more of our capacity to business markets, and this can be seen in the changes beginning in June. In non-Hawaii new markets, we saw a modest outperformance versus expectations due to the sharp uptick in travel demand in March, which follow the general trend of the rest of the network of broad-based improvement across all geographies. All told, for Q1, we came in at the midpoint of our operating revenue guidance at down 9%. While the Omicron impact was higher than anticipated in January and February, the improvement in March outperformed our expectations, and we're very pleased with the recent revenue trends. Looking at Q2, the positive momentum continues, and we're expecting the operating revenues to turn positive versus Q2 2019, estimated to be up 8% to 12% despite capacity below 2019 levels and managed business revenues yet to fully recover. As we were already operating at pre-pandemic load factors in the low to mid-80% range, our revenue improvement outlook is primarily due to higher passenger yields, both leisure and business. We expect another solid contribution from our revenue initiatives, in particular, with GDS as managed business revenues are expected to improve sequentially. April managed business revenues are expected to be down 30% versus April 2019, and we expect to see sequential improvement in May and June. We also expect our new fare product to roll out this quarter, which we call Wanna Get Away Plus. Having 4 fare columns displayed in our website is a natural evolution that is geared toward offering customers the attributes they want to choose while not taking anything away. The general attributes of Wanna Get Away Plus are : the introduction of transferable flight credits; more flexibility with same-day confirmed change in standby benefits; and a higher earned multiple for Rapid Rewards points. At the same time, our Anytime fares will gain the Express Fly By Security Lane and priority check-in perks where available as well as EarlyBirdCheck-In benefits. We believe this will better represent the product offerings that our customers want and are going to pay for, and it has the added benefit of generating incremental revenue for the Company. Given the timing of the rollout, we aren't expecting a material benefit in Q2, but we are expecting a solid revenue contribution in the second half of 2022. Lastly, on our revenue initiatives, our revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. Before I wrap up, I want to share some color on our capacity and published flight schedules. We continue to expect our Q2 capacity to decline 7% versus Q2 2019. While this is a 2-point sequential increase in Q1, we expect a 5-point sequential decrease in stage length from Q1 as we establish trips in shorter-haul markets aimed at business travel and in an effort to provide more recoverability to the operation with more frequencies. We have now adjusted our published flight schedules through Labor Day to match flight activity to our 2022 capacity guidance. In terms of network restoration, we will be roughly 80% restored by June based on trips. And based on our full year capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we expect to be roughly 85% restored by December. As we have discussed, it will take us some time to rebuild the network that we want given current staffing constraints. We will continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our network by the end of 2023. And with that, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Van de Ven : Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. On our last earnings call, I walked through the availability of staffing and our challenges that we face due to the Omicron variant and the roughly 5,000 employees that became sick in the first 3 weeks of January. As a result of that, we reinstated an incentive pay program that ran from January 9 through February 8. The incentive pay program work is designed. Our employees responded very well. They picked up extra shifts that helped us cover the flight schedule and those employees out sick. While the program cost us $127 million, it afforded us an opportunity to more quickly stabilize the operation. In the first 7 days of January, our on-time performance was 41.2%. From January 8 through mid-February, that on-time performance jumped to 85.1%. That put us #2 for on-time performance in the industry, and that was a monumental feat after the start to the year that we had. What I think is most impressive about our people is that they not only stepped up to cover the extra shifts during what can only be described as an Omicron crisis, but they put Southwest Airlines in the top spot for customer satisfaction in January for the DOT's Air Travel Consumer Report, and we remained in the top spot among marketing shares in February as well. Our people have been through a lot these last few years, and just to accomplish that in the first 2 months of this year is just superb. And my sincere thanks to everyone out there on the front line that's working hard for Southwest and are taking great care of our customers. I am very pleased that our employees and our customers can now make a decision for themselves as to whether or not they want to wear a mask on board our aircraft. I know that enforcing mass compliance has been a tough endeavor for our employees for a long time now, and they deserve a break. The science supports the mask mandate expiring. So great news on that front. Relative to early January, our operational performance in February and March improved. Our February flight levels stayed relatively low at 3,300 flights per day, and then they increased to roughly 3,400 flights a day in March. And as Andrew mentioned, travel demand in March surged with load factors in the mid-80s. We anticipated a ramp-up in demand, but we did run into a few challenges during March related to weather and ATC delay programs. In mid-March, we had Winter Storm Quinlan. That impacted many of our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast airports. And then we also had a line of severe thunderstorms that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico and across Florida, and that resulted in air traffic management programs, operational adjustments and then resulting flight cancellations. In early April, we experienced a technology outage that caused similar issues, and it took a couple of days to work through that event. We've had a tough time during irregular operations given our center network and some of the unanticipated air traffic control slowdowns. The good news is that we've made some adjustments to our network starting this month that we believe will help and I'll speak to them more shortly. On the staffing front, we continue to aggressively hire. And as Bob mentioned, we're now targeting over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. The majority of this hiring is in the operations group, and it's imperative that we are properly staffed. The goal with the majority of these hires is to cover our published flight schedules and our capacity plans this year. But also, we intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future and get ahead of our spring and summer 2023 staffing needs. We are making great progress with hiring, but we have thousands of employees that are in training, and they're still gaining proficiency. So it just takes time before we'll going to have a full complement of frontline employees that are on the job versus either being a new hire and still in the training pipeline. So we've made trade-offs with lower capacity in order to support operational reliability. And the combination of this and the continued hiring should help us as we move into the summer. On behavior trends and hours worked per employee, we continue to lag pre-pandemic metrics. We're still experiencing higher sick time, more employees on inactive status and overall staffing availability challenges. We've also had some constraints on training throughput, but we believe we have a path to get the sufficient headcount in our key operational groups this year. It remains a work in progress, and it's one of our top priorities. Until then, our capacity will remain muted versus the aircraft that we would like to return to service to accelerate the network restoration. And lastly, Andrew mentioned that we expect our average stage length to decrease by about 5 points from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that should help us with our operational recoverability in Q2. We're adding short-haul flights in the business-oriented markets. That provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We won't snap back to a historical network composition overnight, but I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve as we restore the network through the end of next year. That should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage, and we're also working on other initiatives to improve overall efficiency and return to our historic levels of productivity. And so with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up for questions. And just a reminder, that please keep your questions to one and a follow up if needed. So Chad, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : A quick question on the corporate side. Can you just give us a little more detail on what you expect the corporate ramp trajectory to be through the rest of the year and the next year? And also, we're hearing from some corporate accounts that they expect a fair bit of competition in the second half of this year going into '23 when it comes to negotiating kind of just corporate travel agreements just given that we're kind of coming off this trough and everyone is going to be fighting for a slice of pie. Or do you have any visibility into that or not? Bob Jordan : Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then I'll let Andrew chime in on more of the specifics. I think we -- while the -- our managed business recovery has obviously lagged leisure -- I mean leisure is well ahead of 2019 at this point. We've seen a really robust recovery. So I think we -- in March, we were down about 36% compared to 2019, but that's a 34-point recovery from January, which is just a really significant trend. It looks like April is going to be about 30%, down 30%, and I would expect that the -- from what we can see, the trends continue to improve through May and then through June. And while it's a long ways away, you never -- it's all a forecast, I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that we could have managed business revenues fully recovered to 2019 levels by the end of this year. But I'll let Andrew add some details as well. Andrew? Andrew Watterson : Yes. Thanks, Bob. The only thing I'd add to that initial macro point of view is if you kind of go back further than January and kind of April of last year when corporates really started traveling again, we have a nice strong trend line, but it has some ups and downs with COVID waves. And so now that we're kind of out of Omicron and seeing a sharp comeback, it's still on that same trajectory, which leads one to believe that it will get to what Bob said. So we have pretty good confidence in this growth because it's grown and rebound strongly through at least 2 COVID waves so far. So that's good news. And in regard to corporate contracts, a lot of them become stale because there wasn't really a lot to renegotiate during the pandemic. So we fully expect there will be kind of a big season of renewal of contracts in the fall, as you mentioned. And given that during the period from pre-pandemic to now, we've greatly transformed our offering in managed business through both the GDS we've talked about, but also ramping up our Southwest business team with the tools for -- TMCs and CTMs as well as more account managers, we think that kind of broad-based renewal is actually beneficial for us and our play for a bigger share of this pie. So we're encouraged by the renewal season coming up this fall. Operator : And the next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Maybe one for Andrew. Sorry to stay with you. Just regarding the strong implied yield improvement in 2Q. If we assume a stable macro backdrop, so stable economy, stable fuel, how do you think about the progression of yields for the balance of the year? I'm not asking for explicit guidance or anything like that. But if the economy does not change and fuel does not change, is there anything you're thinking about which would cause yields to change seasonality or otherwise? Andrew Watterson : What we did -- the economy printout today wasn't a positive one, so I don't know how long we can say the comment doesn't change. But at least, consumer spending was still strong in the underlying details of that. So I think the broader picture, though, is that demand for air travel, especially for leisure, is above 2019 levels, as Bob mentioned. However, supply is not. And we don't see a pathway yet for supply to get back to 2019 levels until much later this year. So a backdrop of demand exceeding supply is what you can give broad based of price increases that we've seen, mostly from the lack of discount fares versus kind of fare structures being increased. So I think that's a tailwind we have going on. Now the wildcard is the economy and how -- what that does over the near term. Certainly, there are headwinds with Fed increases and stuff like that, but the underlying consumer spending seems to be robust. So I feel like we have pretty good confidence in the kind of continued demand outpacing supply, at least for our guidance range. Does that answer your question? Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. Yes, I couldn't get you to completely agree to no change on macro, but I think that's helpful color. Just as a follow-up, is there any way to think about yields on this 2019 baseline on a same-store basis? I mean I know the network looks very different than it did back then, and you alluded to that, but how much of this RASM expansion is the result of not flying lower marginal RASM routes because of your constraints right now? Andrew Watterson : Well, it's hard to generalize because we have -- the network is different, and you have demand being different of leisure and business being separated by so much. And I did mention that business fares are up versus 2019. So I think you can see broad-based demand exceed supply is the driver regardless of the route structure. So now you'll still have variations in your route by route, but I think it's still a broad-based demand strength and a broad-based supply insufficiency, is what's behind all this. Getting kind of a little more detailed, I think, doesn't really show you any different trends than that kind of broad-based trend I talked about. Bob Jordan : And Duane, I would just add the same thing. You've got this set up in the second quarter here. Again, it's all a forecast where you have overall operating revenue performance up 8% to 12%, on capacity down 7%. I mean so that's a significant amount of strength. And that's still on the backs of your managed business being down. The talked about in April sort of the in 30% range. The other piece of this, too, is as we restore our network, there is -- and we've got 125 aircraft that we need to put into restoring the network this year and next year. That all comes on at lower than normal risk in terms of the typical yield drags you might see as you add new cities or new routes because these are routes that we've had before, and they're connecting cities that we have a presence in. So I think they come on without those penalties. At the same time, again, if the trends hold, you're restoring business at a faster rate, which also helps on the yield side. So -- now who knows what's going to happen to the macro economy? There's a lot of different things that can occur out there with the Fed moves and potential for recession. And I think what's helpful there is that, despite all of that, consumer savings is still more than double what it was coming into the pandemic. So there's a lot of consumer strength out there in terms of what they've saved and what could be spent. But anyway, hopefully, that helps a bit. Operator : And the next question will be from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Maybe this one is for Bob or Mike. But can you guys just help us understand where the constraints are right now on operating more capacity? Because I hear you that you need to restore the network to pre-pandemic levels, but your stage length is only down maybe 2% here. Your FTEs look like they're almost back to 2019 levels. Now maybe with a lot more new folks that need to be trained up. But is this really a pilot issue? Are you guys having trouble filling trainee classes? Can you speak to some of the constraints and what it's going to take to get back to where you want to be? Bob Jordan : Yes, Brandon, let me take a shot, and then Mike can add a lot of detail there. I think we are -- hiring progress since we restarted in the fall has just been tremendous. We've hired thousands of folks. We're now projecting that we'll hire over 10,000 this year. Obviously, there's some attrition in there as well, but I'm just really proud of our people department and our hiring teams for making that happen from literally a dead start last fall. If you look at that in aggregate, we are still today below our total FTE headcount in 2019, so we haven't caught 2019 yet. It's just 1 basic point. The other is, as you think about just all the folks that we've hired overall, they're not all working or working proficiently yet. So we've hired roughly 8,000 in that time period, but 1,600 in a typical month right now, they're in training. So they're not out there on the frontline. They're not working. So they're in training, so they don't really add to our ability to fly and add capacity. If you look at the remainder, we have something on the order of over 15% of our entire workforce that is new since the fall. So they're out there working, but you know what it's like to have a new job. They're just not proficient yet. They're not efficient. They're still learning their positions. So that comes into account as you think about our ability to restore capacity. Now when you get to the where are you most constrained, definitely, it's pilots. And to some extent, it's our flight instructors to train our pilots. We had several thousand pilots go out on the long-term leaves with COVID. We had another 640, I think, take early retirement. Job 1 was to get everybody that was out on leave back trained and flying, and we just got that completed literally in February of this year. And then job 2 is to replace the pilots that took early retirement. And we're just over half the way through that, maybe 2/3, so we haven't caught that back up yet as well. So I would tell you that, yes, the chief constraint right now is on the pilot side. Mike, yes, please add some more detail. Mike Van de Ven : Yes, Brandon, I think most of the other work groups that we hire to really is just a one-step process. We go out, we find the people. We bring them in, we interview. For the pilots, it really is, for us, it's a 2-step process. Step #1 is making sure that we have flight instructors in place that can so we can get to our maximum capacity of flight training. And so that's where we're focused at this point in time is making sure that the slots that we have for training are focused on flight instructors so we can have -- we can get up to maximum capacity in terms of our hiring towards the end of this year and into next year. So that's step #1. And then in terms of access to pilots, we still have -- we're an airline that pilots love to come to. We have a long history of success here. And so we're able to go fill up our classes and have access to the pilots, at least certainly here in the next year or 2. Operator : The next question will be from Helane Becker from Cowen. Helane Becker : Just 2 questions. The first question is on the crew members who worked extra hours. Are you concerned that as the year goes on, especially at the end for the peak, there won't be enough crew hours for them to fly during the busy year-end season? Bob Jordan : Yes. Helane, are you talking about pilots running up against their block hour limits for the year? Helane Becker : Yes. Bob Jordan : Yes. I don't think that we're at risk of that at all. We've got our schedule adjusted for the capacity that we have. We'll see more pilots coming online in the second half of the year. And so I don't think we'll have an issue with that. Helane Becker : Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe, Tammy, one for you since you've been so quiet during this Q&A. On cash and liquidity, how are you thinking about bringing cash down to whatever your new minimum liquidity or cash level is going forward? Tammy Romo : Yes. Thanks for the question, Helane. Yes, our -- obviously, our liquidity is much higher than where it has been historically. And if we have learned anything through this pandemic recovery, it can be choppy. But we are making really great progress as evidenced in the commentary that we shared with you on our second quarter outlook. So we're making really great progress there. And when you combine that with our fuel hedge protection, are very encouraged with where we're headed there. So all that to say is I think we're really well positioned. So we want to get comfortably past the pandemic. Obviously, we want to have plenty of cash reserves to invest in the business, and we've shared all of that with you. But we do want to work down our cash levels over time. I've shared with you in the past that kind of -- right now, we have an agreement to be roughly, call it, $10 billion in cash. And now going forward, we believe we can continue to bring that down. Now can we get back to historical? Should we get back to historical levels, which were probably in that, call it, $2 billion to $3 billion range? It may need to be higher than that. So we're going to work our way through that. Obviously, first order of business is to get back to solid profitability. So looking good there. And we want to invest in the business. And then obviously, we want to get back to shareholder returns. And we certainly have a desire to reinstate our dividend. And as we go here, as always, we'll consider share repurchases as those feel appropriate. And obviously, that will be based on, as always, free cash flow and just profitability level. So kind of a long-winded answer, Helane. But clearly, we want to get back on track to what we were delivering pre pandemic, and that obviously starts with adequate returns on capital, and that starts with profit. So I think we're making really good progress here, and we want to work our way back to those pre-pandemic levels. Operator : And the next question will be from SaviSyth with Raymond James. Savanthi Syth : Just a question on the stage length. You mentioned kind of 5 points of contraction here in this quarter. And I would assume that a lot of those other markets that you're adding on short haul as well that, that might continue to contract. Any color you can give us over the next few quarters on how that will trend? Or was there something kind of unique about the network restoration this quarter that had a bigger jump than you expect going forward? Bob Jordan : Yes, Savi. Good to talk to you. I'll give a start and then let Andrew, obviously, weigh in from a network perspective. But as we redesigned the network here to deal with the pandemic, and it was obvious that leisure demand was going to come back faster than business, we orient ourselves in that direction. So yes, we flew longer. We had differences in places like intra-California. And now that business demand is coming back, you want to -- you want the network position to take advantage of that. So really, it's simply adding back more short haul to really build -- begin to build the network that is aligned around the business demand that we anticipate. The good thing is, in addition to meeting the business demand, that additional depth in the network also helps us with our recoverability for our customers. So it helps us with network depth. And when we had the regular operations, it's extremely helpful. Andrew can talk to sort of thinking forward sequentially does that continue, but it is a big shift, a 5-point change quarter-over-quarter in the stage length is significant. You didn't ask this, but it is a piece of our cost story here in the second quarter with costs up, our CASM-X projection up 14% to 18%. Sort of half of that is labor rates, airport, those kinds of things, your typical inflation. The other half is sort of inefficiency in the system plus the drag caused by this increase in -- this decrease in stage length from Q1 to Q2 as having a material impact as well. But Andrew, if you want to just add some color on just the -- this and where we are going forward in terms of stage. Andrew Watterson : Yes, certainly. The -- if you kind of break down our network in the short, medium and long hauls, what's really going on here is we're adding back lots of short haul and even more medium haul versus 2019 in order to kind of get -- restore the network. It also happens to be kind of business-oriented as we see business demand recovering. And then also, as Mike mentioned, helps the network, all things being equal, for recoverability. So really, it's a case of what's missing, and that's the long hauls that will probably be the last to be restored. Because they'll be attractive to customers and they do well financially, they don't add as much to kind of network resiliency or kind of business travel recovery. And so we kind of prioritize those. And so you'll see stage length for a period of time be down as a result of this. And then towards the end of restoration, you should expect it to start to come back up a little bit as those long hauls get restored. Savanthi Syth : That's helpful. Is there kind of a general on that just the stage-length level that you think you'll get back to when it's fully restored? Andrew Watterson : Yes, I think as you get -- we said we'd be largely restored by the end of next year and then we get towards the end of next year, success would be having a lot of those network metrics look very, very similar to just before the pandemic. And so that's where we want to be. As step 4, we now have these new things we added during the pandemic could overall enhance the attractiveness of the network, but the composition of short, medium and long and the kind of what's the point-to-point versus connecting, all that goes back to the network we love before the pandemic. Savanthi Syth : And can I ask a quick follow-up on the pilot responses earlier? I was just curious, in the opening remarks, you mentioned setting up for more material growth in 2023. Just curious like how -- because it seems like, again, for Southwest, hiring is not the issue, clearly an attractive destination, but training class sizes and that bottleneck seems to be on the training side. So when you talk about kind of material growth next year, I mean, are you expecting your training class sizes to get bigger? Or like what's going to change that helped you get back to kind of growth next year, especially on the pilot side? Bob Jordan : Yes. Well, Savi, we've got a 26-bay training facility out there. Currently, we have 23 of those bays filled. We're going to have three additional simulators here coming online later this year, and they'll be ready and fully operational for next year. So we have that capacity growth there. And then as I said, if we can get our instructor level up to our targeted levels, we'll have plenty of capacity in terms of our training to produce more pilots next year, even balancing out our recurrent training with the new hire training and the upgrade training. Operator : And the next question will be from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : I don't know who it's for, but I'll pose it anyway. You had really good growth in ATL, maybe just 10% below 1Q '19 levels, but the big three at 50% to 100% higher ATL growth in the first quarter this year versus 2019. And I guess my theory is that it's because of the policy change on change fees, but curious if you have a perspective on that relative performance. Tammy Romo : No. Really nothing to do with any policy change fees at all because we have not really changed that. Myles Walton : Sorry. I meant fare change fees changing. Tammy Romo : Yes. So no, I really -- when we've been sharing the demand environment is just obviously really strong. We had a surge in bookings here in March, so just really solid, robust demand. And we're seeing that, as we've already shared on both the leisure shop side as well as the corporate side. So, I would attribute that just more to strong bookings. Myles Walton : Okay, okay. I was really getting at the delta between their outperformance and your in-line performance, but I'll take it up off-line. And then just a clarification on the 10,000 hiring versus the 8,000 previously, can you just add color to that as well, if there's a difference in composition versus the January comments? Bob Jordan : No, I think it's just -- if you look at our ability to train, so training capacity, it's come up just here a little bit. And so really, that's the difference. There's no other significant change. We want -- it's going to take into 2023 to restore our network deep into 2023 and to fly all of our aircraft. And so the sooner we can get there, the better. And so we've -- as I mentioned before, I'm just really proud of our hiring folks because we went from a dead start to hiring at these incredible sort of 1,500 a month kind of levels here in six months. And so really, it's just a boost in our ability to hire versus we have somehow changed our target hiring. Operator : The next question is from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Catherine O'Brien: Maybe just staying on the labor front, labor availability has been a major theme this quarter. It seems like you guys got ahead of the curve realigning your outlook for this year. So, asking a longer-term one. When we get beyond 2023, I know there'll be some lumpiness with changes to this year, but beyond 2023, is your five-year guidance for mid-single digit capacity growth and low single-digit unit costs still doable in your view based on what you can see for your own hiring pipeline and then what you're hearing from airports and your third-party vendors? Bob Jordan : Yes, I would say that there's a lot of choppiness out there. So we've -- you've got unknowns in the workforce. Who's going to return? What's driving some of the folks who were out of the workforce? You have inflation concerns. You have this -- you got Fed policy. You have this overhang of a potential recession. So, there's a lot of things that are going to drive the macro economy, which obviously drives the workforce, things like that. And we're not in control of that, and the projections are a little bit all over the map at this point. I would just tell you that, while you do have to work harder, we have not had an issue hiring quality, I mean, really good folks. I spend a lot of time with our new hires. I'm proud to bring them into Southwest Airlines because they're exactly the kind of people that we want here. I think we're going to have to continue to work hard and adapt our hiring. We've all had to speed up the processes. We've had to use channels and techniques that we didn't before, like social media. We've had to do instant interview, instant offer, all that. But I think, beyond that, I don't see, as you look beyond '22, '23, that somehow the labor market becomes a constraint to what we want to do, what we want to grow. Job number one is use all of our aircraft, fully restore our network. And then beyond that, we've got aircraft coming. We have lots and lots of opportunities. You saw us open the 18 cities. We have a lot of opportunities in front of us, and we intend to take advantage of those. Tammy Romo : Yes, Bob. And the only thing I would add to that is just in terms of our five-year targets, I agree. I do think we were out ahead. We were certainly expecting inflationary pressures this year, and that's certainly playing out here as we go. But I think we all have confidence in our plan, and so nothing that we're sharing with you today would change any of the five-year targets that we shared with you back at Investor Day. Catherine O'Brien: Okay. That's great. And then maybe just for my next one. You already walked through how you're moving around to MAX 7s and MAX 8s this year, just given the status of -7, I guess, just like what makes you comfortable with taking more of that larger variant closer in? Is it the demand uptick? And then what's your willingness to keep taking -8 closer in, just pending the -7 certification? And then maybe just along with that, are there any moving pieces we should think about on CapEx here as you move to larger gauge? Or given that this is more of like a Boeing FAA issue, do you keep your -7 price in? Or -- and maybe you can get some like remuneration just given the changes to your order book. Sorry. It's a bit of a long run. Tammy Romo : No, I think I followed what you're trying to ask there. But just in terms of the overall mix of aircraft, we really do have a lot of flexibility with the network. As we've been sharing a year today, we're hard at work to restore our network and that really does call for a mix of aircraft. So we feel really good about taking the MAX 8. We -- as we shared today, we firmed up 81 of those for this year. So we're just -- we'll just continue to monitor that as we go. And I don't really see any issues even into next year from a network perspective. So we'll continue to work with Boeing to firm up position. So no, very pleased and don't really -- we have a lot of optionality, and I think we can manage that really well here as we restore our network and resume growth. Bob Jordan : Catherine, the way I just thought about it is just pretty simply is we have two big objectives with the fleet. We want to modernize the fleet and then we need more shelves to restore the network. And at the end of the day, I think we're comfortable anywhere between the 8s and the 7s in the 60% to 40% split one way or the other. So it might be a little choppy here as Boeing gets the MAX 7 certified. But as you plan that out over the next couple of years, we're going to be in that range, and we don't want to give up delivery slots in the near term because we -- because the modernization and the restoration are important to us. Catherine O'Brien: Totally makes sense. Operator : The next question is from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Michael Linenberg : Quick one here for Andrew. Can you just walk through some of the considerations what drove sort of your thinking in expanding the Hawaiian interisland operation? And as a consequence of that, are you going to have to establish either a pilot and/or flight attendant domicile there. Andrew Watterson : I'll start with the last part first. No, usually, we have much larger operations before we start to establish domiciles. Secondly, as I referred to in my remarks, we kind of restructured Hawaii, both the summer and the fall, but part of that was we're reallocating more capacity in the business market because business has a robust return. And then for kind of customer preference, we've done some changes to our Mainland Hawaii flying, which is mostly about how we take the connectivity we have because it's mostly point to point with some connections on top of that restructured where we'd like to have those connections to take place on the Mainland. And then for the ones that -- places where we want to have gateways mostly kind of origin, then we will have those connections happen to neighbor islands in Hawaii. So as a consequence of that, we have less flying from the Mainland to Hawaii and then more flying between the islands. It also has a great benefit of having some time of day appeal because our previous frequencies did not allow for kind of reliable day trips for business travelers in the islands. If you think about your business Ravanaahu with the largest population, you're going to Maui, those are very nice hotels and Maui, but there's not a business hotel, so you have to get back that night. And so the service pattern has to allow for the early morning departures and the evening returns. And so the increased frequency count also appeals to them. So, it achieves multiple objectives, and it's part of that broader restructuring of a reduction of about 20% in Mainland Hawaii flying as part of that. Michael Linenberg : Okay. That's super helpful. And then just a quick one to just Bob or Mike on the 10,000 up from the 8,000. Bob, as I recall, a few months back, you sort of hinted that it's not just 8,000 this year. It feels like it's probably going to be 8,000 for several years. So the way we think about it, is it 10,000 this year and you're getting ahead of next year and therefore next year you may be looking to only hire 6,000 on a net basis? And what in round numbers, how many pilots this year and next year? I know you said that you're going to replace 640 pilots who had early retired. But I believe your natural attrition is probably several hundred pilots per year. So what are we looking at for this year in pilots and maybe even '23? Bob Jordan : You bet, and there's a lot in that question, but I think the -- I mean there are really two things happening in hiring. Number one is to catch us up to where we need to be to our current fleet and network restoration. As I mentioned before, we're still below -- just in total, we're below our 2019 headcount still. And we -- and as I also mentioned, we have a large number of the new -- our new employees, so they count in that number that they're either still in training or they are gaining proficiency. So in my mind, it's six months, nine months a year before they're fully proficient as a longer-term employee. So obviously, we've got to catch up. Number two, we want to get a bit ahead here because we've got a lot -- we've got 114 aircraft coming in this year. We have 90. And then net, obviously, some retirements next year is going to take the 125 to restore the network. So it's taking a lot to get back to where we've got our network restored. So there's a bit of that 10,000. There's part of that 10,000 that's catching up. And I think there's a part of that 10,000 that's trying to get a bit ahead. At the end of the day, the goal number one is to fly all of our aircraft, restore our network, have a reliable operation. And then as we've talked about, by the end of 2023, get back to our historic operational reliability and get back to our historic productivity, which we've defined as regained 2018 productivity and efficiency. How that translates into an exact number of hiring for 2023? I can't really tell you just because it's dependent on attrition and a whole number of things. My guess just because of the aircraft number or the deliveries, net retirements are falling from 2022 to 2023. It may be reasonable to expect that 2023 hiring overall is a bit lower. But I think we just have to see -- again, I come back to the number one goal is use all of our assets, fly all of our aircraft and return by the end of 2023 to our historic efficiency and reliability. On the pilot front, Mike can give you a lot more exact number than I can. What I've got in my head is the pilot hiring in 2022 here is roughly 1,200 or so. Mike, so yes, if you don't mind just a little more detail on pilot. Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Just a couple of things. In terms of the hiring, just the way I think about that, I'd always rather go faster than slower. When we get behind on staffing, it just takes a longer time to catch up with that. And then if we can have staffing with some cushion, it gives us a better cost profile with less premium pay. It gives us a better operational recovery profile. And if you find yourself in an overstaffed situation, you can just dial back the hiring and you can solve that pretty quickly. So -- just as a frame of reference, the faster that we can hire and get up the speed for us, the better. In terms of the pilot hiring, Bob is right. We've got somewhere just north of 1,000 pilots here this year. And then if we can get up to full capacity, we can produce probably close to 2,300 pilots next year if we needed to. Bob? Michael Linenberg : Thanks for the details. Big numbers. Bob Jordan : Thanks you, Mike. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question, and that question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : It's Scott on for Sheila. Just on that managed corporate down 30% in April, is there any way to maybe parse out how much of that is restoration of 2019 managed corporate revenue and how much is coming from taking share with these new revenue initiatives you put in place? Bob Jordan : Andrew, you want to take a shot at that one? Andrew Watterson : Sure, which I'm going to disappoint you is we're -- the -- that's part of our overall revenue switch, which we gave a benefit of $1 billion to $1.5 billion at Investor Day, and we're not decomposing those individually. You can certainly take a look in the ARC data and see our increasing composition of ARC and what that means for us getting more and more business travel. But that restoration is a combination of what we had before and new stuff. The new stuff is really mostly share of wallet, if you will, for individual entities. So the people with whom -- while we're doing business through GDS, we were also doing business through our Direct Connect or Southwest business, SWABIZ application before. So it's really about giving them multiple ways to purchase from us, whatever distribution channel they prefer. And we're seeing we're getting more of those accounts business as we've given them this option. Bob Jordan : Yes, I think the thing that's terrific is Investor Day in December we laid out our revenue initiative plan to add $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT in 2023 and half of that here in 2022. And so -- and it's all things that attract business. So as Andrew said, GDS, it's new revenue management tools. It's the new fare product, which is Wanna Get Away Plus. It launches here shortly. It's our enhancements to our Rapid Rewards program and our agreement with Chase. And all of those things are on track, the ones that have been delivered are performing. And so I think the main takeaway is that we laid out a really good plan, and we're on track to meet those goals. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call. I appreciate everyone listening in. Thank you for the questions, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications. Linda Rutherford : Well, thank you very much, Chad, and welcome to our media members. I think we can go ahead and get started if you would give them the instructions on how to queue up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein : I just had a couple of quick questions. Bob, Southwest has said previously that they plan to hire 25,000 people over three years. So, the 2,000 that you added today to bring you to 10,000 for this year, do you think that just brings the 25,000 to 27,000? Or do you think you still over those three years would end up adding just the 25,000? Bob Jordan : Yes. Well, Mary, I'll be completely honest with you, which was that's an old -- the 25,000 is an old number. And as we were planning, it was a very round number. Just trying to think through what it takes to get our staffing fully back in place. The other thing to that, to me, that's a gross number, which is, we always -- we have attrition in there, too. So I wouldn't be -- I don't think I would be quite so granular. I do think the -- if you look at the changes this year, so the 8 becoming 10, I feel comfortable with that because a lot of that was dependent at the time that we set the goal of eight. We weren't quite sure what we could ramp the hiring machine, too. Because we -- again, I know I've said this three times, but we went from no hiring machine to trying to hire thousands. And it was -- we were just unclear in terms of how quickly we could rebuild all those processes. And we've done a -- our folks have done a terrific job, and we're actually ahead of eight. And so that's really what's raised the eight to the 10 in this case. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. And although you talked about how many pilots you hope to hire this year, a couple of months ago, you actually trimmed your plan for hiring first officers because of the lack of simulator instructor or flight instructors. Has that number changed? Like have you had to carve out a few more just despite the goal that you have of hiring over 1,000, if you had to bring that down any? Bob Jordan : I would tell you that it's moved around. Our constraints generally have moved around over time, which group, in particular, is the real constraint. The constraint right now is it's flight instructors. We've made tremendous progress on our flight instructors, and we're getting very close, but that's really what is the narrows constraint versus literally pilots. We have a lot of pilots in the pipeline, and we could go faster if we had our full complement of flight instructors. Now we recently have really invested in speeding up that process. So probably way much way more than you want to know, but we have retention bonusing. We have referral bonusing with our current employees. We have begun to use or thinking about how to use pilots who have recently retired to be flight instructors. So we really widened out our thinking in terms of how to grow that because every airline is looking for flight instructors right now. But no, that's our primary constraint right now is flight instructors. Andrew Watterson : Yes. And Mary, Mary, we do -- our target this year is to hire 1,200 pilots. And I think we have a very reasonable path to hit that target. Just realize, though, that some of those pilots are going to be coming on here in late October, November, December. They'll still be training, and they won't be out on the frontline flying at that point in time. Mary Schlangenstein : Right. Okay. And how many flight instructors do you need to add to be fully staffed? Andrew Watterson : We're looking somewhere between -- to hit our plan, 35 to 38. To exceed our plan, a little north of that, say, 50 to 60. Operator : And the next question is from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : I guess the last question, just curious if you're seeing any issues with fuel supply at any of the airports where you operate. I know it was a little bit of an issue some places last summer, and it seems like the stocks are kind of low in some parts of the country now. I'm just curious, if that's something you're anticipating or what you're doing to get ahead of it? Bob Jordan : Alison and Tammy, please chime in. I would tell you that those are really spot issues, and we're really not seeing those now. The issue now, of course, is price. And price differentials across the country and then not just the rise in underlying crude prices, but a titanic rise in the crack spread, which is driving up costs as well. Luckily, we're well hedged. And our hedge portfolio this year is going to add about $1 billion in value in terms of helping manage our fuel costs. But no, straight up with your question, we aren't experiencing significant issues with fuel supply at this point. Tammy, if you want to add anything. Tammy Romo : Yes, you covered it, Bob. Yes, really no physical issue, so much better position than we were. And yes, and even relative to just the increase in prices, as Bob already said, we've got a wonderful fuel hedge in place. So no, I think we're in a much better position there. Alison Sider : Okay. And I guess one other thing I thought was interesting you mentioned about just people being sort of new and it's taking time for people to kind of get ramped up and to be really proficient in their jobs. Where are you seeing that kind of manifest? Is that kind of slowing things down on the maintenance front? Or where is that causing issues? Mike Van de Ven : Alison, mostly that presents itself on the ground and in the airports. So think about your new ramp agent and you're out in the different conditions that you'll operate in during the course of the year, just navigating through all the transfer bags, navigating just to the speed in the tempo of the airport operation out there, all the equipment move. It just takes several months for you to kind of get up to speed and get comfortable in that environment. And we want to make sure that we focus them with a lot of supervision and a lot of oversight because it's a -- safety is our highest priority out there. We want to make sure that with the new hires out there we've got all of our Is dotted and the Ts crossed as we're executing through our procedures. Operator : The next question will be from David Koenig from The Associated Press. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Bob, your fares in the first quarter were up quite a bit from a year ago, although they're only up 5% from 2019, which I suspect is less than CPI. But any concern that consumers who are seeing inflation in everything they buy, because travel is a discretionary choice, do you have any concern that general inflation and higher fares are going to cut into the strong demand you're seeing? Bob Jordan : Yes, Dave, thanks for the question. There's a lot in there. And again, I just said, a base, I just want to reiterate that we've not been raising fares. So we did have one modest fare increase in the first quarter. I think it was $5. What's really happening is that we've got a normal fare structure. And as demand is really strong, the lower-end fares close out faster and you move along the fare structure, but we've not modified our fare structure. The other thing that I would add is as we -- especially as we add our Wanna Get Away product and as we've managed what we call fare gaps between the columns, what you're seeing is that, in a lot of cases, and Andrew could talk to this in most cases, the prices or the differentials between Wanna Get Away and Anytime and Business Select have come down substantially. So our fares on the upper end are actually and that fare gap is actually much lower than it has been historically. So in that case, those fares are actually more affordable. But generally, as demand is strong, and it's extremely strong. Again, our second quarter operating revenues per our forecast could be an all-time record, which is just incredible after two years of the pandemic. But as you see that kind of strength, seats are going to sell out faster and customers are going to see higher fares. So far, we don't see any dampening of demand. Some of that may be because there's a lot of discretionary household savings still in the system. But so far, we've seen no indicator that demand has been dampened by this increase in fares. Andrew, you want to add anything? Andrew Watterson : The one thing I'd add is, overall, our capacity is down versus 2019 for the summer that you mentioned, Dave, as well as the industry as a collective. So we're actually not able to satisfy all the travel demand kind of as is given the capacities or like in 2019. So there will be people who are not buying that would have bought in 2019. But as we restore more capacity, we expect that demand to be there. David Koenig : Okay. I get that the rise -- the higher average could be because the lower buckets are selling out faster and everybody's capacity is still recovering, but I just wondered if there was any concern going forward about the inflation nipping this in the bud. Operator : And the next question is from Kyle Arnold from Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Kyle Arnold : Have you done -- made any more work? Or is there anything specific you've done to solve some of the regular operations problems? I know there's report about a meeting in Florida, talk with the FAA about some of the issues happening in there. What are you doing to make sure that some of that, either TAC or the staffing or the compounding problems, don't creep up again this summer? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Let me start out there for you, Kyle. So we've done a couple of just basic things. As you know, we've reduced our originally published schedules through Labor Day. That absolutely is going to give us more cushion and staffing cushion in the operation. We've been talking all morning long about our aggressive hiring plans. So adding people there and then Andrew talked a little bit about us reoptimizing our aircraft flow and our design toward the shorter-haul trips, and that's going to help our crew and our operational recovery. So we feel that those are the three big pieces that we're in a much better condition in place that we've been in as we move forward. We do have -- as you mentioned, we do have specific -- and when I say we, I mean, the airline industry, has specific impacts with respect to Florida air traffic control and travel through there. And it's a combination of problems down there. There's more commercial activity. There's more GA activity. There are more space shuttle launch. The weather patterns that go through there are complicating all of that additional traffic. And then I think that just like everyone else going through with staffing, the FAA is going through staffing challenges as well. So there is a focus, an industry focus on that. And in May, the FAA and some of the impacted carriers are going to talk about solutions to that specific airspace. So I think when you package all those things together, we're in a much better place going into this summer than we were last summer. Bob Jordan : And Kyle, I just wanted to add -- I wanted to just offer some praise for the FAA here because they're taking this head on. We got this meeting in May to develop solutions. They're working with carriers, are working directly with us and to think about developing solutions because, clearly, we have more issues this year, more weather. Mike mentioned you got more SpaceX and other launches. The flight activity is back above -- scheduled flight activity back above 2019 levels. But the other thing that's obvious is we put -- as they put in programs, flow control, those kinds of things that are designed to manage the issue. They're just not working as effectively as they have historically. So I'm just really pleased that the FAA is hitting that one head on and they're working with carriers and working with us directly to find solutions that work for everybody. Mike mentioned one other thing that I think is really important, which is while we both -- there's been a lot of public focus on, scheduled flight activity is above 2019. I think it's really important to point out that general aviation, or GA, aircraft activity is far above 2019. That takes a piece of the -- obviously, the limited air space out. So I think that understanding that and solving that is a significant part of the solution as well. Operator : And the next question is from Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Speaking of higher ticket prices, you now offer uplift as an option. I just was noticing it really just popped up right when I was searching for a flight. Can you give any color to what percentage of bookings -- new bookings since you've added that people are buying now and paying later? I know with Southwest vacations, it was a notable percentage. And secondly, speaking of Southwest Vacations, are you guys taking that in-house? Bob Jordan : Andrew, I'm going to defer to you. Andrew Watterson : Okay. Yes. We do offer uplift. It's a very small percentage of sales that I'm not going to disclose, but it's also part of the overall progress we've made in payment forms, whether it's PayPal, Uplift, Apple Pay. We've just been on a program in the last three years or giving more and more options for payment method for consumers under the idea that more choice is better. And for the vacations and higher ticket values, yes, that order value is rather that does offer a benefit for consumers that want it. And then secondly, on Southwest Vacations, we are, as we kind of alluded to an Investor Day, on an approach to kind of restructure, redefine how we handle Southwest Vacations. We're setting up a team and working with industry partners to figure out how we take advantage of the fact that our network is really over-indexed, a lot of big leisure destinations where packages are sold, and yet we don't really distribute through the traditional package channels. And so there's an opportunity there for us to do more business and packages consumers. And so that's something that we're looking at as a future revenue initiative. As we kind of look over the horizon in order to kind of meet the investor promises we've made about RASM performance exceeding CASM, we don't want to leave ourselves with a vagary of kind of the market, so to speak. So we need a pipeline of revenue initiatives that allow us to have kind of ex market, if you will, benefits that can make sure we keep our own. So this is one of those things. It's kind of still in the laboratory, and we'd expect to roll out over the next couple of years as we make more progress. Operator : The next question will be from Laurie Aritomi from The Washington Post. Please go ahead. Laurie Aritomi : Teeing off of Kyle's question, I wondered how you might characterize Southwest's approach this summer compared to last summer. You mentioned you're in a much better place going in last summer was kind of odd because not folks weren't -- there was pent-up demand, but all folks weren't vaccinated. So can you talk about this summer versus last summer? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Laurie, just generally, I just think that the conditions that the U.S. is operating in is different this summer, this summer coming up as compared to last summer. So last summer, we still had surges of COVID coming. We still had challenges across the country with schools, with daycare, with parent availability, with working from home. There were lots of challenges that created a situation where people just couldn't behave in this pandemic world like they did in pre pandemic. And as a result, when we went into the summer, we should have had more staffing because the tempo of the operations were slower last summer. And we should have had more staffing available or less capacity out there to navigate through that better. I think some of those conditions are changed as we come into this summer. As you mentioned, there's more vaccines out there. There's more boosters out there. And we've also got a better balance between staffing and our capacity. So we have cushion, more cushion available this year to absorb any shocks that come. Bob Jordan : Yes. Laurie, I think it's exactly what Mike said. We've got, I think, number one, we've got more visibility I mean we thought we knew what was happening last summer. And then the demand just surged at the sort of April, May last minute. While we've got a big surge this summer, we've seen it coming for a lot longer, and we've been able to anticipate it. Two, the network is more restored and there's more flight activity, which means you just have a better ability to recover when you have a regular operation and a better ability to move customers and then move employees when we need to. Another big item is COVID poles. And so we had employees that were going out on -- you have a close contact, you go out, you go out to, I can't remember, it's 5 days or 10 days. And so the number of employees out and then out at the last minute. So it was not predictable. You didn't know until today what your workforce was going to look like in a lot of ways. And so with the change in those policies around COVID, that's gone, so we can have a much better predictability around sick leave and the available workforce. So I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, but I think our ability to manage the summer and our belief that the summer is going to be much more reliable from an operational perspective is much better here in '22 than it was in Operator : The next question comes from Ethan Clapper from TPG. Please go ahead. Ethan Clapper : We're hearing from pilots and from members of swap out that there have been a lot of no shows for pilot classes and that recruiting has been especially difficult in that area. So why is that? And how can Southwest fix that? Mike Van de Ven : Well, Ethan, generally speaking, I would just say Southwest Airlines is the airline for pilots. We've got very competitive rates of pay, great benefits, good retirement program. And we have a very efficient network with less ground time. And I think that allows our pilots just to get more flying per day than anybody else. They generally receive more pay then as a result of that. So I just -- I feel like the Southwest Airlines is an airline where pilots want to come to. We've protected their careers. We've built great retirement programs and great career earnings for them. So you take that as a foundation of it's a great place to work. I believe, given that, we are going to attract absolutely our fair share of pilots out there from all the pools. We may see ebbs and flows from one class to another, but I think we have all of the tools and the toolkit we need to attract all the pilots that we need. Bob Jordan : Yes. And I think you got to be careful generalizing. I think, overall, this has not been an issue. You always have no shows. We've had classes, and we've had a good no-show rate -- I mean good show rates, and we've not had a significant portion that didn't show in the class. So this has not been an issue. We recently had a class where we had a higher no-show rate than we expected, and we're trying to understand exactly why that happened, but I wouldn't extrapolate this one incident to we have a broad-based problem. So you just got to be careful about that. And then number two, there's a ton of work going on. It's a competitive market. And the longer you take to make an offer, the longer you take to get somebody into a slot in a class, the more risk you run that they could go somewhere else. And so there's a ton of work going on between our flight ops department and our people and hiring folks to take those processes down to the absolute minimum, and we're all over that. But I think the main thing is I wouldn't extrapolate what happened in a class to what's happening across the board because it has not been. Operator : And the next question is from Chris Isidore from CNN. Please go ahead. Chris Isidore : Wondering what you can say about where you see the status of the various labor negotiations. And do you feel any -- it would be advantageous in your hiring efforts if you were to -- be able to wrap those up and be able to let potential new hires know what the labor contract would be if that puts more pressure on the negotiations than maybe in the past years when you were doing the hiring binge that you're doing now? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Yes, Chris, so I've been through a lot of labor contract negotiations over the years. And I would just say over the 50 years of Southwest Airlines, I would characterize every contract negotiation is vigorous, is contentious, is passionate on both sides. And what I will tell you is that, over that 50-year period, those kinds of negotiations between the unions and the Company, they have manifested themselves, I would say, in the most job secure, the highest productive and the most attractive career earnings opportunity for our people. And that's what our people really want to have. They want to have a company they can count on through good times and bad. And if we can get through the contract negotiations and achieve all of that faster, I'm absolutely for that. But at the end of the day, it's that process that creates that -- the Company needs and our people's needs, and we've been very successful at doing that over the years, and I see no reason that we won't be just as successful going forward. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for just one more question, and that question will come from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Please go ahead. Robert Silk : David Koenig actually had a story about this recently, but what are you -- are you all getting many calls or cancellation requests from individuals who are worried now that there's no mask mandate? And if so, are you allowing cancellations in those cases? Bob Jordan : Robert, I -- we watch our customer relations calls and questions every single day. I haven't seen a material rise in that at all. We survey our customers every single day. And I would just start with the percentage of customers that are comfortable flying just overall is very, very high. It's 90%, 90%-plus. The second is we also survey how comfortable our customers are flying without mask, and that number is also very much in favor of our customers being comfortable. And just to mention on the mask, I'm very pleased for our employees and for our customers that they now have a choice. It's tough to wear the mask all day. The data shows that while cases may be rising modestly, they're very low. Hospitalizations are not rising. So I'm just pleased that our customers and our employees now have a choice. We have -- we always have had wonderful flexibility in our policies and our fares. And so every ticket that you buy can be cancelled and then those funds held for future use with no change fee. And obviously, if you buy a refundable fare, we will refund that. But if you're not comfortable flying, we'll either refund that if it's refundable and/or we'll allow you to use that -- those funds for future ticket. But generally, overall, no, we're not hearing -- I'm not hearing anything relative to customers cancelling because they're now afraid to fly because of the mask mandate change. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Chad, thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us and for putting a little bit of extra time, so we could accommodate all the questions for you this afternoon. If you have any follow-up, our Stellar Communications Group is standing by 214-792-4847 or you can visit us online at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you all for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In just a moment, we will share some prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And with me today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation and future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. Also, we had a few special items in our second quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference our non-GAAP results as well. So please refer to our press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information. And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, what a difference a quarter can make. Coming off first quarter's net loss, you will recall that we are encouraged by the positive trend change in travel demand in March, and we're optimistic about summer travel revenues. That said, I don't think any of us expected demand to surge to the levels we experienced in the second quarter, particularly in June.  Andrew will cover the revenue details, but Q2 operating revenues increased 13.9% versus Q2, 2019 to an all-time quarterly record of $6.7 billion, despite Q2 managed business revenue still down 24% and capacity that was still down about 7%. We also produced an all-time record quarterly net income, excluding special items of $825 million. It is all because of the people at Southwest Airlines and I want to just say a huge thank you to them for a job very well done. I want to congratulate them on the progress that we've made together. It's just an incredible turnaround from last year, not to mention just a quarter ago. Looking forward, demand continues to be strong. We continue to experience both inflationary pressures and headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency. Energy prices have moderated a bit recently, but remain high, and we expect to have another meaningful fuel hedging gain here in Q3. But most importantly, we remain largely on our plan for this year. Our 2022 capacity remains stable. We remain on our cost plan. We're slightly ahead of our overall staffing plan and our operational reliability is much improved. We've made tremendous progress, and our people have a lot to be proud of. I'm just extremely thankful for all of their efforts in getting us to this point in the pandemic recovery.  Our third quarter guidance is based on our current outlook and excludes any significant unforeseen events, but I'll admit that there's a lot of noise out there right now. It seems that all of us know someone who has this latest strand of COVID, inflation pressures are real, and they are worried about a potential recession.  Consumer and business sentiment is down, and there are data points out there that could indicate early signs of a slowdown. But so far, demand remains strong and we haven't seen material impacts to our business. As always, we'll continue to monitor the environment and be ready to respond if needed. It's helpful to remember that we have historically lagged in terms of impact to revenues going into a recession, and we have typically lagged recovery coming out. Well, you've heard me mention our list of key priorities for 2022 many times; I'd like to share our midyear progress on each of them. First, getting properly staffed at focusing on our people. I'm really proud to report that we reached pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022, which is just a huge milestone. We continue hiring in specific areas, particularly for pilots, and we expect to add over 10,000 employees this year out of attrition. We're pleased to be seeing the impact of our hiring in airports, especially given the busy travel season that we're in, now that thousands of new employees have been due training and are contributing on the front line. Second, making progress towards our historic operational reliability and efficiency. Our operational performance since April has been very strong, and our flight cancellations in May and June were less than 1%, which means a 99-plus percent completion factor. Mike will cover the operations in more detail, but we are benefiting from getting better staffed, getting new employees through training and on the front line, adding more short-haul flying to provide better network stability and adding more flying between crew bases. We know that we've got work to do on the efficiency side, as we focus on 2023, and we're laser-focused on walking down fleet and capacity plans, moderating our overall hiring, optimizing staffing to flight schedules, ringing out cost inefficiencies and returning to our historic efficiency levels by the end of next year. But again, I just want to thank our amazing people for their hard work, as we continue to improve our operational reliability. And I want to thank our partners at the FAA and in the administration for working to overcome challenges and continuing to improve the airspace as travel demand returns. Third, providing legendary hospitality. I'm very proud of our people and our employees for restoring our customer service advantage this year. For January through May, we are number one in customer service for the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I continue to be out in the field on a regular basis, and I get to experience firsthand our terrific employees taking great care of our customers. I get the e-mails, I see the stories, and I truly appreciate what they all do each and every day for our customers and for each other. I'm also very pleased to announce that we continue to make traveling on Southwest Airlines even easier by adding yet another customer benefit, our new flight credits don't expire policy. It's an industry-leading flight credit policy. And when you combine that with no change fees, no bag fees, rapid rewards points that don't expire and transferable flight credits, it's just a powerful low-fare brand combo that's all about winning more customers. While there is a cost, it's really the onetime cost of extending the COVID-related funds that would have expired this September and we expect the impact to be immaterial beyond this quarter. And finally, returning to consistent profitability. We just reported record earnings for Q2 and this is the most stable revenue environment that we've had in over two years. We remain well protected with our fuel hedge, and we are currently expecting to be profitable for Q3 and Q4 and for the full year 2022. Our main gating factor to future growth is pilot hiring. Despite delays in aircraft deliveries, we feel good about our ability to fly our flight schedules as planned, which are currently published through March 8. Our current outlook for first quarter 2023 is for capacity to be up about 10% versus first quarter 2022. And if we find ourselves in a position to need to republish schedules or trim capacity, we can certainly do that, but I'm optimistic that we can continue to avoid that going forward. It is still very early for 2023. So we're just going to take it one quarter at a time beyond our currently published schedules, but we're turning our focus to 2023 planning and, in particular, regaining historic efficiency levels, and we'll share our 2023 outlook with you at Investor Day, which is currently planned for December 7th. Last, I just want to stop and acknowledge the assailant incident event that we had at Love Field earlier this week. Luckily, all of our employees and customers are safe. And I just want to say a huge thank you to our employees for taking great care of our customers and each other. I want to thank law enforcement for their swift and professional action. Thank the TSA for managing the fault out. And just thank you to everybody involved for keeping this from being worse. I'm just very, very grateful for that. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this quarter, which resulted in solid operational and record financial performance. The demand surge, coupled with constrained capacity, resulted in a strong yield environment and record quarterly operating revenues of $6.7 billion. The record revenue performance drove record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million despite higher fuel and inflationary cost pressures. We have also posted a strong operating margin, excluding special items, of 17.4%, which exceeded second quarter 2019 levels. All around, this was an impressive quarter and an important milestone along our pandemic recovery. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, including why we made the policy change regarding flight credits that don't expire, but I want to make a few comments regarding the timing of revenue recognition for breakage revenue for tickets expected to go unused. The pandemic caused an extremely high number of customer flight cancellations during 2020, and to a lesser degree, last year and even the beginning of this year with Omicron wave. As a result, we have had more flight credits outstanding than normal. Today's policy change to eliminate the expiration dates for unused funds will result in lower breakage revenue for third quarter than we would record under our previous policy in large part due to the COVID-related travel funds that were set to expire in September. Andrew will cover the sequential impact to revenue in a minute, but we expect the policy change to result in significantly lower breakage revenue in third quarter, which we factored into our third quarter revenue guidance. We currently expect that impact to be in the $250 million to $300 million range. As we look beyond third quarter, we expect breakage as a percentage of revenue to normalize back to pre-pandemic levels and any ongoing impact from this policy change is estimated to be immaterial beyond this quarter. Our people did a great job, managing costs in second quarter and our fuel hedge performed very well. While market prices have moderated a bit lately, they are still elevated and volatile given the current geopolitical climate, regardless of the continued uncertainty surrounding the market our fuel hedge significantly offset the market price increase in jet fuel in second quarter 2022, saving us $330 million in fuel expense. We are 59% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, slightly below our second quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.46 of hedging gains, which represents cost savings of more than $230 million in third quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and jet fuel cracks can move materially on a daily basis. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our 2023 and 2024 portfolio. The fair market value of our fuel hedge for the second half of this year is approximately $430 million, which would bring our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit to roughly $1 billion based on price assumptions outlined in our earnings release, and the fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2023 and beyond is estimated at roughly $580 million. Taking a look at non-fuel costs, second quarter CASM-X was favorable to our previous guidance range at up 13.1% compared with second quarter 2019 and due to lower-than-anticipated benefit cost and the shifting of some maintenance costs into the second half of this year. For our third quarter, we currently estimate non-fuel CASM-X to increase in the range of 12% to 15% when compared with 2019 levels. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for our labor, benefits and airports. The remainder of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as we continue to work to get adequately staffed and our new employees trained, while third quarter capacity levels are expected to be roughly in line with 2019 levels. Overall, I am pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, especially in this environment, and our full year CASM-X guidance remains unchanged at 12% to 16% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all work groups beginning April 1st, taking into account our best estimate in this labor environment. Turning to our fleet. We have revised our expectations for aircraft deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as the current status of the -7 MAX certification. Through the first half of this year, we took delivery of 12 -8 MAX aircraft, and we now expect to take delivery of 23 aircraft in the third quarter and 31 aircraft in fourth quarter. All -8 MAX aircraft for a total of 66 deliveries this year. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We plan to retire a total of 29 -700 aircraft this year and currently estimate will end the year with 765 aircraft in our fleet, which supports our currently published flight schedules through March 8 of next year. We have additional information in our press release, so I won't reiterate all the fleet details. You will see that our contractual order book still reflects 114 MAX deliveries, including options this year, but we are providing you our best estimate for what we think we will receive this year based on recent discussions with Boeing. We will continue working with Boeing with the focus on this year and next. Based on our updated planning assumption that we will receive a total of 66 -8 MAX aircraft this year, we have lowered our 2022 CapEx guidance to approximately $4 billion, 1 billion lower than our previous guidance that assumed the delivery of 114 MAX aircraft. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $16.4 billion. We also recently extended our $1 billion revolving line of credit by two years with no change to our covenants, and it remains undrawn and fully available to us. We are in a net cash position and leverage is at a very manageable 53%. We continue to be the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. We have modest scheduled debt payments for the remainder of this year. However, we have been opportunistic and have repurchased some of our convertible notes, $302 million so far this year and $505 million in total with $1.8 billion still outstanding. As a reminder, the payroll support restrictions on dividends and share repurchases remain in place until the end of this quarter. As always, we will be evaluating our capital plans with our board as we began planning for 2023. Throughout the pandemic, we've been surgical in our capital allocation decisions to drive future growth and value. And in terms of priority, as we move forward, we intend to continue investing in the business as we scale for future growth. We will continue paying down debt, and we will continue to be opportunistic where we can and we may have opportunities to reduce our leverage at a faster pace. As ever, we are committed to generating returns on capital, well in excess of our cost of capital and intend to outline our future capital plans at our Investor Day later this year. So more to come on that. In closing, I am very pleased with our second quarter results. As Bob mentioned, we remain on track with our plans this year, have better stability and have good momentum heading into the second half of this year. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue trends and Q2 outlook, and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q2, we experienced a significant change in revenue trends compared to Q1, as travel demand began to surge in March. Each month in Q2 was stronger than the prior in terms of load factor yield and revenue. June represented the strongest monthly revenue performance in our history, and we had all-time quarterly record operating revenues in Q2 of $6.7 billion, which was up 13.9% versus Q2 2019, in line with our guidance. Leisure demand was robust, and we also saw a notable improvement in business demand. Managed business revenues improved from down 36% in March to down 19% in June. While business passengers and overall business revenues remain below 2019 levels, managed business fares were above 2019 throughout Q2. Our Q2 loyalty program revenue also represented an all-time quarterly record, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Q2 retail sales spend for cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue contribution. Our new cities and development markets performed well, as did Hawaii, which was aided by the modifications we made to our Hawaii flight schedule and Mainland flying. Our revenue initiatives also performed well, and we launched our new fare product Wanna Get Away Plus in May. I want to congratulate our teams on a successful rollout. And customers are responding well to our expanded fare offerings. All told, Q2 was strong across all geographies and metrics. And we were very pleased with the results. As you saw in our release this morning, beginning today, any flight credit that results from a flight change or cancellation, no longer will expire in the future. Previously, Southwest flight credits had to be flown within one year for the date our customers originally purchased their ticket. We also are eliminating the expiration date on any flight credits that are currently valid and unexpired, including those travel credits that were issued as customers changed their travel early in the pandemic and would have expired this coming September. We're famous for offering industry-leading flexibility across the board. And customers tell us it is one of the key differentiators of our brand. Repeat purchases by engaged customers is a cornerstone of our business model and our success. Our customer research and feedback tells us that flexibility has become even more important to customers over the past two years. Therefore, it's important to us to deepen our commitment to flexibility and the ease of doing business with Southwest Airlines. And with this move, we are clearly the industry leader and unmatched in this regard. The value proposition for our customers is greater than it has ever been. Now looking at Q3, we're coming off of June's peak performance, but current demand trends remain strong. We continue to experience strong passenger bookings yields and load factors. Leisure bookings are trending in line with seasonal expectations. Business demand is also trending well, and we expect Q3 business -- managed business revenues to improve the down 17% to 21% compared with Q3 2019. July is the second weakest month for business travel and August is a mix of leisure and business, as leisure summer demand seasonally cools off in the back half of the month. If we look at post-Labor Day bookings on hand at this point, we're encouraged by both leisure and business bookings, although it's still pretty early in the booking curve, especially for business travel. I would be remiss, if I didn't mention that there are quantitative anecdotes from external data that indicate industry yields are softening off of the peak of June. And we are watching our bookings very closely. That said, we are overall pleased with the trends we are currently seeing and expect Q3 operating revenues to increase 8% to 12% versus Q3 2019. Included in our Q3 guidance are two headwinds and as we look at sequential revenue expectations compared with Q2. First, we have a five-point sequential headwind due to our policy change to remove expiration dates from our flight credits, which Tammy mentioned is a one-time impact. And secondly, we have a two-point headwind due to our network restoration with focus on short-haul markets in Q3. Our network restoration is important to getting back to full utilization of our assets, but is already providing benefits in terms of operational reliability. And we believe this revenue headwind is temporary until business demand recovers more fully. Our Q3 capacity is roughly flat with Q3 2019, and our Q4 capacity is expected to be down 1% to 2% versus Q4 2019. Our flight schedule is currently published through March 8. And based on current plans, January and February 2023 capacity is flat to January and February 2019. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase 10% versus Q1 2022. We are still early in our 2023 planning process, but that gives you an idea of where we expect to begin the year in terms of capacity. In terms of network restoration, and based on our full year 2020 capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we continue to expect to be roughly 85% restored by the end of this year. While capacity levels are in line with 2019 in the second half of this year, our network won't be fully restored until at least the end of 2023 as we continue to rebuild the vast majority of flights we cut during the pandemic to fund new city growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Van de Ven : Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We are in the middle of the busiest summer travel season we've experienced in several years, and we're making significant progress in delivering a stable and reliable travel experience to our customers and to our employees. Our hiring momentum began to build in the first quarter, and that's continuing. Those additional employees are beginning to impact our day-to-day operating environment as they complete their initial training and move into their respective roles. Our new hires, combined with the scheduled reductions that we made earlier in the year, as well as our ongoing operational modernization efforts, have stabilized the operation as we continue forward. From the beginning of May through the busy 4th of July travel period that I know you all heard about on the news, our cancellation rate was less than 1%, and that's the best performance for Southwest since 2017. Our on-time performance over that same period, as measured by the DOT, was 74.3%, and while that is certainly below our expectation, it's primarily an operating tempo problem. Our tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires just starting work, heavy load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from weather and staffing. If on-time performance was measured within 30 minutes, that 74.3% would improve to 85.3% and that's in line with our historic pre-pandemic levels. So in practical terms, that means that in today's environment, almost 90% of our nearly 4,000 flights a day are operating just like they were pre-pandemic, but about 10% of the flights have a 15-minute delay that wasn't there in pre-pandemic periods. So we've made solid progress towards historical operating results, and we're doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We've accomplished all of that by balancing our flight schedules with staffing. Our staffing -- our active staffing is up over 7,000 employees since the end of last year, and we surpassed 2019 levels of active staffing in May. About 75% of this hiring was in our airport operations and about 20% were in flight crews. We're going to continue hiring. It's imperative that we remain adequately staffed to support both our customers and our employees. We're focused on improving the experience of our flight crews in terms of reroutes and deadheads and any unplanned overnight and extra flying. And finally, we've improved the quality of the schedule for our operation with more depth and more nonstop flights. We've added short-haul flights in the business orient markets provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. And we also had more flying between our crew bases and all of those things and all of those changes support a more stable operational environment. As we continue our network restoration, I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve. I believe that those improvements, combined with our other operational initiatives, are going to provide the foundation to recapture our overall efficiency and return to historic levels of productivity. And just a couple more thoughts on hiring and training. As travel demand began to rebound last year, our first step was to rebuild and restart our hiring machine, and we had staffing shortages and bottlenecks throughout the organization from recruiters to the front line to supporting positions. We've been running at a record pace this year. And from a company-wide perspective, we've augmented our staffing in most of the critical areas, and that's leaving just our pilot hiring and training as the pacing factor for the company as we move forward. So as Bob mentioned, we still expect to add over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we're now at a point where we can begin to transition those hiring efforts into more targeted and focused locations and groups where our network restoration has occurred. The majority of these hires will be to cover our published schedules and capacity plans this year, but we also intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future, and then get ahead of our spring and summer of 2023 staffing needs with a more seasoned workforce. We're still being impacted by COVID illnesses and a higher level of inactive employees. Our sick rates are still elevated in some of our work groups. So we believe that it's just prudent to build some staffing cushion and buffer in the aviation environment that we all find ourselves in. And none of that is unique to Southwest. It's a work in progress and getting back to historical levels of productivity by the end of next year remains one of our top priorities. So on a separate note, I wasn't able to be at our grand opening of our new 130,000 square foot aircraft maintenance hangar in Denver during the second quarter, and that's going to be very helpful to the operation. With the addition of Denver, we now have seven Hanger locations : Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando and now Denver. Our tech up team does a tremendous job, and I want to thank them for managing through a changing flight schedule in a fleet plan over the past several years. And last, but certainly not least, our people have solidly restored our customer service advantage. Year-to-date through May, Southwest is back in the top spot for customer satisfaction for the DOT's air travel consumer report and my sincere thanks to all of our employees, especially all those on the front line that are taking care of our customers and of each other. They are simply the best, and I have my deepest respect and admiration. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ryan. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Mike. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-an-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hi, good afternoon. Just in terms of the MAX delays here. I know you're talking about really working on one quarter at a time as you plan 2023. But was curious if the delays. I know pilot hiring, you've kind of talked about being the long pole in the tent. But do the delays that you're seeing today kind of give you pause about your ability to kind of plan in 2023 capacity? Bob Jordan : Hey, Savi, it's Bob, and I'll let Tammy and Mike jump in. Yeah, obviously, the change is a big one from 114 to 66 in 2022 here. But Boeing and GE and others are suffering supply chain issues just like everybody. So I'm not sure that it is completely unexpected. The good thing is if you look in through our published schedules through March, which I think are through March 8 right now, because we did have excess aircraft that we've talked to you about, that reduction doesn't compromise those schedules. So we'll be able to fly the schedules as planned, which is good news for our customers, good news for our employees. It's a big number though. So if you think about how long is it going to take to recover the catch up in terms of the delivery plan. I suspect, again, this is all kind of guess, we're going to go schedule-to-schedule, quarter-to-quarter, but it feels like it will take 2023, could leak into 2024 in terms of how long it takes to catch back up to the fleet, the original contractual fleet delivery plan. Now to your question, which is well what about constraints, which has been pilot hiring. If you end up -- there's, I think, a chance that if you leak into -- if this continues to delay into late 2023, you could get to the point where the constraint becomes actually the aircraft deliveries versus pilots. So I think that would be late in 2023 and not earlier. So again, we're just -- you don't -- it's all speculation today. But for now, we'll stay really close with Boeing, and that's late in the year 2023. So we'll keep after our pilot hiring plan. Savi Syth : That's helpful. And if I might, on that pilot hiring topic. Just I think you were saying the last quarter that you're kind of hiring or training around just over 1,000 this year. Is the -- you're getting capacity that you can kind of do with the hiring and training for maybe 2,300 next year. Is that -- I know that's the top end. Is that what you think you're going to need to do, or how should we think about pilot hiring and training kind of costs and levels as we -- as you kind of move through the second half of this year and into next year? Bob Jordan : Yeah, we'll hire -- this doesn't change if you're tying that to the Boeing issue, it doesn't change that at all. So yeah, we're looking to hire 1,000 to 1,100 this year. We're roughly on plan there. I'm very proud of everybody. We -- for a while, we told you, we were short flight instructors. We've hired all of our flight instructors as of, I think, May. So the training, the SIMs, it's all running at full capacity. I think the plan is to hire about 2,200 pilots next year. So that will remain our plan because it's full capacity, and then we will get these aircraft even if they're slightly delayed as we talked about in like 2023. So this doesn't change our pilot hiring plan. Savi Syth : I appreciate that. Thank you. Bob Jordan : You're welcome. Tammy Romo : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. This kind of builds on Savi's question. I mean given the Boeing issue, it doesn't seem like Southwest will ever catch up to where you would have been in terms of overall size, had COVID not occurred. So if we think about 2025, I don't see a path where Boeing could accelerate to make up for lost time. So it seems inevitable that you'll be smaller in 2025 than you once planned, smaller in 2026 than you once planned and so forth. If you agree with this, why not take more substantive steps to shed surplus costs now instead of just waiting for capacity to accelerate from here? Mike Van de Ven : Hey Jamie, this is Mike. Just maybe one way to kind of think about the Boeing delays as I've been thinking about them, there are production issues that are supply chain related, then there are delivery issues that are based on a certification issue with the MAX-7. So, Boeing has produced through the production line, MAX-7s, but just not able to deliver them yet. So I think that you will find a \u2013 when the MAX 7 is certified, we'll be able to catch that up quickly in 2023 and then we're just struggling with production delays that aren't long, they're probably no more than a month or so as they deal with their supply chain. And I think that will get better in 2023 as compared to where it is today. Jamie Baker : Okay. Tammy Romo : And Jamie, Tammy here. Just to add on to Mike's comments back to your question on the cost side. We -- Bob has already taken you through the pilot hiring, but we do intend to optimize here as we move forward, best we can, on the best -- based on the best information that we have from Boeing, and we'll continue to hire pilots.  But moderate in other groups around what our best guess is for capacity as we close out this year and into next year. So, we've kicked off our planning efforts for next year. So obviously, all the information that we shared with you today will be inputs into that. And clearly, we want to come up with a unit cost performance that makes sense relative to the capacity that we're flying. Bob Jordan : Yes. Jamie, we have plenty of time, if you're thinking about '24, '25, we have plenty of time to adjust along the way here, if things change. We just now -- and I'm very proud of this, we just now caught our 2019 capacity here in the third quarter will be about flat. And we just now caught our 2019 employees, we're slightly over about 1,600 here at the same time. So, we've just caught up to 2019 at this point.  And as Tammy said, we'll begin to moderate our -- we'll begin to moderate our hiring really ex-pilots here in the back half of the year. And our goals for '23 haven't changed, which is, that now at some point, you're just running it all this to get stable. Now we really begin to pivot to moderate the hiring, begin to wring out inefficiencies and get to our goal that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is get back to our historic efficiencies by the end of next year. Jamie Baker : Okay. Very helpful. I appreciate you jumping in. Thanks Tammy as well. And just as a follow-up on the pilots, raising the 65-year rule, it really seem to have any union traction to speak of. And obviously, for airlines with multiple fleet types, at a nonstarter because of the training costs that it would drive. But with only a single fleet type, does this imply Southwest might be in favor of relaxing the rule? Mike Van de Ven : Jamie, it would be basically, what our pilot you would want. We're not going to have an opinion on that. And at this point in time, I don't think that there's much energy around us doing that at all. Jamie Baker : Okay. So totally agree. I was just curious as a single fleet operator. Appreciate it. Take care, everybody. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Jamie. Tammy Romo : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : And the next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Just on the flight credits, is there any way you can help us think about what a clean sequential underlying revenue would look like, kind of, 2Q to 3Q, excluding the credits in both periods. You know, this is not just a Southwest issue, but you've brought it up clearly, and I'm wondering, can you disclose what credits were like as a percentage of revenue in the 2Q? And do you expect that to pick back up in the fourth quarter? Tammy Romo : Yes, Duane, I'll take that. I hope you're doing well. So well, first of all, as you're aware, we don't disclose our breakage revenue. But even during the pandemic when it's been elevated, it still represents a really small percentage of overall revenue. So in terms of the underlying trends, we expect the ongoing impact to total operating revenue beyond third quarter to be immaterial, and it shouldn't be a material driver of sequential trends. And just to note on the second quarter, even without the elevated breakage revenue in second quarter, we would have still had record revenues and the underlying business trends were very strong. So -- but in terms of what is your starting point in terms of our core business trends, it would be the results that we reported to you this morning in terms of revenue for second quarter up almost 14%. So just in terms of trying to help you sort through the trends. So again, the third quarter impact of $250 million to $300 million, you know, you really should look at that as kind of a onetime impact here related to the policy change. Ryan Martinez : And Duane, you want to -- I want to add, sort of, 50,000 feet on this because there's change in flight credits is a big deal. Obviously, it's a terrific consumer benefit -- customer benefit, and it matches perfectly with bags fly free, no change fees. Rapid Rewards points that do not expire, all the things that you know about that separate Southwest Airlines. So it's a terrific added benefit. And I'm absolutely confident it's going to win more customers and improve customer loyalty and retention, just like bags fly free did for us. On the timing side, we were up against -- you had a big pile of COVID travel funds from, especially that early period of COVID, where there were so many changes that were set to expire in September, and we felt like we needed to address that, which is a big piece of the why now and the timing. On the cost, the -- this onetime isolated to the third quarter 250 to 300. As Tammy mentioned we think it's immaterial beyond that. That's really primarily the revenue impact and timing of recognizing the revenue/breakage on these COVID funds. Ultimately, they're going to be used. They could break. It's going to come back to you. It's just going to come back to you over time. So it's -- to me, a lot of this is a timing issue, but it's the right thing to do. If it's terrifically with our brand, again, it's a onetime third quarter thing here. And I'm convinced, absolutely like bags fly free that it's going to be not just a customer positive, it's going to be a financial and shareholder positive as well. We win more customers, and we retain more customers. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for that detail. And then just a quick follow-up, and I apologize if you mentioned it already, but your 2022 CapEx is a bit lower. Do you see that as a shift into 2023, or could 2023 potentially be lower as well? Thanks for taking the questions. Tammy Romo : Yeah, Duane, it is a shift into next year. Now hopefully, we'll catch up here on the Boeing deliveries, but if those shift a bit into 2024, then we'd see some shipping into 2024 on the CapEx side as well. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Didora : Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time today. If Tammy -- if a delivery program keeps getting pushed out and limits your ability to fly your anticipated schedule, what types of levers do you have in order to help maintain your longer term cost structure that you outlined at Investor Day? And then just heading into 2023, I know it's early, but anything out there that would not drive 2023 CASM below 2022? Tammy Romo : Yes. On -- certainly, our goal for next year remains to have CASM-X down from this year's level. So we haven't given up on that goal. Obviously, capacity is an input to all of that, as you're well aware. But going back to our discussion a little bit earlier, we -- as we move forward, we will work to optimize our staffing around our expected capacity plans. So again, just trying to get back to our historical efficiency level. So we're very focused on getting back to our historical efficiency, and we've got a lot of initiatives underway to help improve efficiencies. And those range from -- over the longer term, anything from self-service for our customers, airport modernization, other efforts along those lines. So I think the -- and then, of course, just the continued restoration of the network. So we'll -- even if we have to grow at a lower rate than maybe we were otherwise hoping for -- we should be able to continue to restore our network, which will help us get back to those historical efficiency levels. So as of June, we were probably about 80% restored, and we expect to be about 85% restored by the end of this year, and we're going to work really hard to be fully restored by next year, which, of course, would give us operating leverage and help our cost performance next year. Andrew Didora : Thanks Tammy. And second question just for Bob. I know your prepared remarks; you said that you weren't seeing any material impacts to your business, which leads me to believe you're maybe seeing some anomalies out there. Is there anything that you're keenly focused on watching right now? Maybe are you seeing any discrepancies among your different income cohorts and the way they book or travel? Anything you want to call out there? Thanks. Bob Jordan : No. And I'll also defer to the master here, Andrew, to add a whole lot of color, but it's just -- it's nothing specific, because it's more the surrounding data. So if you look at our booking strength, it continues. I mean, obviously, June was a peak as it is typically across the -- sequentially across the year, but the booking strength is there. You've got strength post-Labor Day. It's really just looking at the other factors. So, as I mentioned, business and consumer sentiment is down. You've seen some peaks here, rates are rising, just all the things that typically lead you to expect a bit of a slowdown. So, really nothing more than that color, because we aren't seeing it in our bookings yet. It's just to call out. And Andrew, please add color to that. Andrew Watterson : I guess I'd add to that, Bob that we see still substantial demand, potential visits to the website, central volumes, but we saw a peak of yields in June. And all the industry data we look at whether that's ARC data, whether that's credit card data, whether that's Adobe or Hopper or CPI, they all point to that same kind of peak in June. And so, loads are fine and yields are up, generously on a year-over -- three-year basis, they're not up as much as June. That's all. So it's kind of sequentially softened a little bit, but at a level that's still well above 2019 levels. So that gives us a lot of encouragement going forward. We're also rotating out of a high leisure period into a high business period. And so, you expect that business to hold up more of your capacity, so to speak, and so that will be the big question. We've obviously guided to a sequential 5-point improvement in managed business into Q3 and how that evolves through Q3, that\u2019s the prime business travel season. It's kind of back half of August through October. If we see good improvement there, I think that that will be really meaningful for trends. Bob Jordan : Well, Andrew you take all that -- yeah, thank you. You take all of that into context. We got like -- I always want to guide appropriately. And so, you take all that into account as you think about your guidance as well. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. David Vernon : Hey, Andrew. I wanted to ask you about the headwind you're expecting from the return of short haul business flying that 200 basis points, whatever you're calling out there. When you think about the driver of that, is that just in some of these high-density markets, you're going to be flying at a lower load factor, or I'm trying to just kind of square that, call out, you're making from a headwind perspective with the bullishness in terms of recovery in managed business travel. Andrew Watterson : So, I'll start off, but we put that in there. The research and development teams from network planning worked with Mike's research and development teams from operations planning, and we looked at what would be the way to improve the operability of our summer into fall schedules. And so, we jointly evaluated innumerable schedule concepts, and we came up with this return of some specific short haul for recoverability Mike talked about, more crew flying between crew bases -- more crew-based originators from like the low 30% to the high 38%. And then, some -- look at mid-day peaking that was stressful and ground operations. All that together made for a more operable summer. Now, because short haul is really powered by business travel, return of business travel will make the kind of revenue impact of that mitigated. And so corporate travel did kind of you see through ARC data, a plateau on a volume basis in mid-June. So, as we come out of summer and people burn off their PTO, they had accumulated and COVID and get back on the road, you would expect that short haul that was put there to help recoverability would get additional travel from corporate travelers. And so that shows up either yield or load factor. It's just insufficient demand for that level of short-haul capacity. In some months, you may see the yield was higher and low was lowered vice versa. It just shows you there is insufficient business demand for that level of short haul at this point in time. But as we go into a more heavy business travel season that can be mitigated through the return of business travel. David Vernon : I think I understand the driver of putting it in there. When you think about the go forward and the look ahead, right, if we do end up in a softer period, like -- can you talk us through how you think about when the decision to keep that capacity up maybe isn't the right one, or how flexible are you on that in terms of the sensitivity to that demand recovery? Andrew Watterson : Besides demand recovery, the second thing that will aid it is a network restoration. You can think of this short haul being restored and longer hauls not being restored creates an imbalance network. And so even though we are predominantly a point-to-point carrier, there's many situations where you have a higher flow content. And if you look at our short haul is on average, besides having higher business content, they have higher flow content. And so by not having the kind of medium and longer hauls in that same geography, we find the short hauls, you're starving them with the flow they normally have. So, as we go through and add in medium and long hauls as pilot supply allows, that will then kind of help balance the system and allow those flights to be fuller, if not with as much business travel as 1 might imagine, at least more flow, which right now we're seeing is carrying a pretty high yield. David Vernon : All right. Thank you guys for the time. Andrew Watterson : My pleasure. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Afternoon. So I'm sorry, I just want to go back to this breakage issue to make sure I understand it. So, if we're thinking about fourth quarter revenue, should we just assume normal seasonality from this lower third quarter run rate, or do we take the third quarter, add back $250 million to $300 million and then assume normal seasonality from that? I'm just trying to understand what this could mean for fourth quarter. Tammy Romo : You would just take our reported results and adjust for a normal sequential trending from what we reported to you or what our guidance is for third quarter. So, you just simply take out that onetime impact. Bob Jordan : And then it's just maybe just to liberate. I mean as those funds that we've now extended are used over time, that's going to play out over a period that's not -- it's going to play out over a period of time as their use and revenue is recognized. Tammy Romo : That's right. It's just simply the timing of the revenue recognition as we move forward. And then the -- our trends as we go forward should really revert back closer to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the percentage of breakage to revenue. Scott Group : So this would have been -- if I'm thinking about this, this would have been the final sort of big quarter of breakage and then you would have seen the drop-off in fourth quarter had you not made this change. You're making this change, so you see the drop-off in breakers starting this quarter and then you sort of go normal from here. Is that right? Tammy Romo : Yeah, I think that's a fair way to look at it. Bob Jordan : That's very fair. Scott Group : Okay. And then, just lastly, I know you've got the 10% plan for January, February next year. Would you think or hope that full year 2023 more or less than that 10% non capacity? Andrew Watterson : I think to start with, the Jan-Feb is flat to 2019. I think we're looking at the first quarter being up 10%. So once we kind of get March out there, you'll see the first quarter versus 2022 being up 10%. And so, that's a good starting point. I don't want to get over my skis. The back half of the year, as Bob mentioned, you have both either pilots or aircraft could become a constraining element, but at least to start the year through at least to begin of the summer, I think it's a good place to start. Ryan Martinez : Yeah, yeah, it gives you good sort of indicator of where we're headed, I think. But yeah, there's so much noise in 2023 right now. And again, on two critical fronts pilot hiring and availability and the availability of aircraft. So we're just going to have to take it schedule-to-schedule. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Scott. My pleasure. Operator : And the next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I guess following up on that conversation about capacity starting off in 2023. Tammy, how should we think about unit cost inflation? Because obviously, you're going to be hiring in front of that network restoration, so should investors be braced for still elevated CASM-X maybe in the first half of 2023? Tammy Romo : Well, we are incurring inflationary costs, as you're aware, which is primarily higher rates for labor, benefits in airports. But I do want to remind everyone that we are accruing for higher labor rates, and that accrual began on the second quarter, on April 1st. So that's fully loaded in the second half and incorporated in the guidance that we shared for you for third quarter. So we do have cost pressures from lower productivity. And I think a key for us will be to really work to continue optimizing our staffing levels around the capacity set that we come up with for 2023, which, as Andrew took you through, we're just kind of out there now through the first quarter. It was pretty healthy capacity growth -- double-digit capacity growth. So obviously, that is going to help for the first quarter. So we're -- the main thing that we're going to have to work through, are inefficiencies as we continue to restore the network and just right-size our staffing. So we're working really hard to do that. And our priority is to regain our historical productivity and maintain healthy unit cost timing to our peers. So it's a little early to give you guidance for first quarter for CASM-X. We'll lay out our full 2023 plan for you when we get together in December for Investor Day, but those are really the key drivers of the inflation that we're feeling here this year. So we're going to work real hard to optimize and hit our goal for 2023 to have down CASM-X year-over-year. Bob Jordan : And just -- sorry to keep adding, but add a little 50,000-foot color again. Whenever -- coming out of COVID, with all of the early retirements and leaves and everything that we all did, we -- as you rebuild your hiring teams, you just ran at the staffing. So we were all hiring a lot. We've been on the sort of 1,500 a month pace here for a while overall. You're going to hear us talk a lot about now we're going to moderate our hiring, because there was a lot of getting -- trying to hire ahead of the demand because there was so much gap between resources and the availability of the aircraft. So as that tightens up, we're, obviously, ex pilots because pilots is really the gap at this point. You're going to see us work to get our hiring closer to the need versus hiring ahead that makes any sense. It's going to take us a while to do that, but you are going to hear us talking an awful lot about moderating our hiring plans, again, ex-pilots. Tammy Romo : Yes. And just one more thought. I don't want to lose it, again, going back to the network, gross duration, as we do bring back on those more of our longer-haul flights, and that will certainly ease some of the CASM-X pressure as well. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate that, guys. And I guess, Tammy, to follow up on that. I mean, is the limitation here really pilots, or is it commercial constraints? Is it Boeing order book, or is it computation of all three? Tammy Romo : Today, it's pilots. We have the fleet we need to fly our schedule through March. So going back to what we shared with you last quarter, we had more aircraft than we really needed. So with the adjustments that we walked through are that we have agreed to file with Boeing, we believe that we can buy our schedule here through the end of the year. And so today, it is pilots. And as we move into 2023, we're hopeful that we'll begin to catch up here on the deliveries, but it is possible that as we get to the end of 2023, the constraint could go from pilots to the fleet. So we just -- it's just too early to give you any more precision than that today. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the managed business revenues improving from, I think, down 30% in April to down 19% in June. Is there any way to think about the breakout of how much of that improvement was volume versus better pricing? And you pointed to fares above 2019. So what are sort of volumes today? And how you think about it getting back to 2019 levels? Andrew Watterson : We had volumes improving faster than fares. Fares were still elevated versus 2019, but volumes really picked up some -- really started in March through the end of June. I will say that it was skewed towards smaller businesses and government and education were traveling. Our largest corporates are the ones that are lagging, particularly banking, consulting and technology who previously were amongst our top-tier travelers now or on the lower side. And then, if you kind of look at our -- all of our accounts, our largest accounts, they're all traveling. They all have activity, and they just have less unique travelers per account, but those travelers who are traveling are traveling just slightly less than their trialing before. So it's more about these large companies don't have the same number of people, but they're traveling right now, which we think varies by company of what that reason is. But that's the kind of hopeful benefit as we get into the travel season here post-summer is to get more travelers per account out on the road. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Got it. No, that's super helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on some of the RASM questions. If we exclude the headwinds from more short-haul corporate and breakage, there's a five-point deceleration. And you mentioned pricing peaking in June, but as we think about that deceleration and how we extrapolate that towards the pricing environment retracting slightly versus restoring the network, I guess, how do you think about potential scenarios into Q4? Andrew Watterson : I'm not quite sure I got the last part of that, but I'll start off with the first part, which is about the deceleration. I think to have year over three-year RASM be flat from Q2 to Q3. One would have to have load factor be flat sequentially, and that certainly is a reasonable assumption. And then secondly, you have to have yields to be flat sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing through all of our external data, as well as our internal, the yields peaked in June. And so -- and that's a leisure heavy period where they peaked. And so essentially, you couldn't push leisure travelers beyond a certain fair level it seems like. And that same highest fare level also seemed to hurt our redemptions as well because the point volume got super high, but now you're rotating in a period where there's less leisure travel, and you certainly can't push fall leisure travel at the same fare levels as the summer. And then we have the kind of composition issue of how much business travel will be back, who are paying the higher fares. So, you have a composition headwind as we go from Q2 to Q3 because this business and leisure and you have the point of business travelers -- or excuse me, leisure travelers have a price elasticity effect, where you can't go much higher. And so that's really what's driving this kind of change. It's not an abrupt change or a free fall. It's just a moderation from the hay day of June. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Sure. Thank you so much. Andrew Watterson : My pleasure. Operator : We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. If I can just follow up on the last comment on the yield. Again, is the message here that what you're seeing is just normal seasonality, or is it like better or worse than that Also, do you have a sense of what percentage of the June yield growth versus 2019 is sort of the new normal or can be built as part of the baseline going forward if you have a sense of that? Andrew Watterson : So my personal opinion is that June leisure travel reflected part trend, part pent-up demand that was kind of a onetime effect, so to speak. And so, we're still seeing leisure yield up July, August, September. So leisure yields are still up and look like they'll continue to be up as far as we can see it in our booking curve. And then yes, you do then have on top of that, a compositional effect. So we have that pent-up demand that will not persist, but you still have an elevated leisure trend and you rotate that into a time of year where leisure is a lower composition of businesses higher. And then back to the question of how much business will there be. So a lot of that kind of ultimate yield for Q3 will turn on how much business demand comes back and if we see a return to that kind of acceleration we had in the spring of business travel. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Sounds good. And maybe as a follow-up. Bob, maybe to summarize a lot of the detail on this call so far. What do you think is the biggest risk facing Southwest over the next six months? Is it a risk of a consumer recession kind of beating up your top line, or is it another kind of operational snap for the industry in a late fall into the fourth quarter that kind of drives elevated CASM-X? Bob Jordan : The -- Ravi, the airline industry, there's always -- it's not for the faint of heart, right? There's all kinds of things in front of you. I don't know that I tend to think of it the same way. We have -- I kind of go into reverse here, and then I'll come to your question. If you look at just the past six months, and where we were. So we've gotten staffing stable. We were on our hiring plans. Obviously, we have work to do with pilots, but we are in so much better shape. We've gotten operationally stable, same thing. We want to do better, but we are in so much better shape. Our cancel rate in May and June was sub 1% better than 2019. We just had a record quarter, record operating revenue. So it's just -- we're hiring 1,500 people. There's so many things to be grateful for in terms of the pace of getting the airline from kind of surviving to being really stable. Now we want to move into the next phase and really move back into operational excellence and other things. But now to really answer your question though, I do think there's no one thing on the horizon. There is -- if you just sort of click through them, there's risk in hiring enough pilots, but we're filling our classes. We have a lot of folks in the pipeline. The SIMs are full, the classrooms are full. We have all our flight instructors, checked, I feel good about that. You have our -- this new delay in deliveries from Boeing, but we're working really closely with Boeing and I feel like we're on top of that. And at the end of the day, we can fly our schedule. So it's not going to force a reduction to the schedule that's been published, which is just terrific for employees and our customers. I guess the biggest thing is just not one thing, but it's just all the uncertainty on the horizon. So you've got a recession potential, and you've got a lot of variability in fuel prices, huge variability and volatility and crack spreads on fuel, you have potential variability in demand because of all those things supply chain issue still. So who knows whether those will materialize or not. The good thing is, we are extremely well positioned. We have the people we need. We have the aircraft we need. We have a $6 billion net cash position. We have 53% leverage and -- so we're well positioned to weather whatever comes our way. So I don't -- I didn't specifically -- I didn't name one thing, but I've just given you a flavor for how I think about it. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, Bob. Sounds like one of the above. Good luck. Bob Jordan : Yes, sir. Ryan Martinez : Well, thank you, Ravi, and thank you, everyone, for the questions. That's all the time we have for the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad, and welcome to the members of the media on our call today. We can go ahead and get started if you'll just give them some quick instructions on how to queue up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Alison Sider from The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the reports that the FAA released yesterday, and specifically, some of the allegations that raised about how Southwest has responded to investigations of certain flight incidents and accidents. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what you made of those allegations, if you agree with those assessments and whether you've made any changes in the last couple of years to your approach to those investigations? Bob Jordan : Hey, Alison, I'll start and then Mike can give a lot better information in detail, I'm sure. But the \u2013 I think from what I've seen here, there's nothing new. It's a collection of old stories. So these are allegations that were raised, I think, in 2018, 2019, all examined by the DOT, the OIG others And I think a published report in February 2020, we cooperated with everyone. FA-AOIG, Senate committees, et cetera, took this very seriously as we always' do. Safety is number one. We are very safe, always improving safety. So I think this was \u2013 my mind is just a wrap-up of that process. So I think in the special counsel report letter that came out even at the end there, it acknowledged this matter is now closed. So I think it's just essentially a closeout of what occurred in 2018 and 2019 versus some new. So to me, it's just \u2013 it's a rehash of something that has been \u2013 that has gone on before versus anything new. But Mike, do you want to add anything? Mike Van de Ven : Yeah. I don't have anything to add there. Alison, we have participated with every group looking into it. We have responded to everyone that was interested in it, and every one of those issues have been addressed. Alison Sider : Okay. Thanks. And if I could ask one more. Mike, you mentioned sort of the connection between having all these new hires who are just new in their roles and kind of just the temp of the operation this summer. Can you talk a little bit about what the connection is, like what where you're seeing \u2013 where you had seen things kind of get slowed down and if that's changed at all in the last couple of months? Mike Van de Ven : Yeah. So just when you think about the tempo, so I think that we've hired about 3,000 ground operations employees in the second quarter. So if you think about the operating environment in the airport, a lot of heavy equipment out there. There's an operating tempo out there, and you don't necessarily feel that, or experience that in training, and so when you are new hire employ part of the one the job, training process is the match you up with an experienced employee. And so a ramp agent in Southwest Airlines that has been there a year is \u2013 he can work alone or she can work alone and process all the activity. If you're a brand new hire, you're paired up with someone. So those are the kinds of things that just pace and slow down the operating tempo a bit. And so we just have given all the hiring, you just feel that as part of the company. Alison Sider : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Dawn Gilbertson from the USA TODAY. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi. First question for Andrew, I would -- I'd like it if you could maybe go into some more detail on your policy change as it relates to credit. I guess -- was it ever under consideration to just extend the COVID credit policy and not make this broader. Can you just talk about the pros and cons you're weighing? Was this a -- you get comment you get questions all the time, can I extend my credit? I know you offered people -- they could pay $100 to get a credit. It just becomes kind of overwhelming trying to do this, and this was -- aside from your brand promise, this was something that you thought would make things a whole lot easier for employees and travelers? Thanks. Andrew Watterson : Hi Dawn, I think you're on to good elements of this. So we had this looming expiration of kind of COVID funds that kind of brings it to the why now, as Bob mentioned earlier. But flexibility has always been important for customers. But over COVID, it's become even more important. And you see like I Wanna Get Away Plus, we like to transfer flight credits. We now have discount refundable tickets because that becomes more important to people. So the desire for customers to have more and more flexibility has been increasing. And now it's become the number one call driver for our customer relations department as people coming in, they call in and talk about their funds. We also added in the website into my account, we kind of put it prominently even before your point balance you have it there. And so -- we -- the elevated desire of our customers for flexibility and concern about funds led us to this move, which we think is consistent with our brand. And so you could just extend some funds, but realistically, that really gives you nothing to go and promise customers. If you say, well, not only this extended, there's been forever, then you can go out and say now part of my marketing message is, I'm giving you this is yours to begin with, and it will never expire. We can market that, and that can lower the hurdle for people to buy ticket from Southwest Airlines because, A, they know they can change it. There will be no fee. They know they can bring bags, all that stuff. And on top of that, you're not worried about using it in a timely manner, because it will always be there for you. So you put those things together and you might as well go all the way and have it never expire versus just a simple extension, which kind of gets lost in the shuffle. Dawn Gilbertson : One quick follow-up on that. Do you have any stats or can you give me any sense, I mean, how many people, obviously, if you have a small credit, it wouldn't have been worth it to pay $100. But how many people paid for that six-month extension by having $100 shaved off their credit. Andrew Watterson : I don't have it, and maybe we can follow-up. I don't know if you even track it. It wasn't always a policy, it was like a compromise sometimes. Many times, we would just extend it for free. And other times, when it was clear that someone had long forgotten and we've extended it multiple times, maybe that was a last gap. So it was not a hard and fast policy from us. It was just an occasional practice, but it shows you the increasing importance of the customers. So we\u2019ll just move to the other side of the ledger, so to speak, and say it's always yours and it will be there for you. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. Thanks very much. Go ahead. Bob Jordan : Well, we're always doing customer research around what do our customers want. That's how we arrived that we need to add, recently, we need to add power on the aircraft. We need to add the larger overhead beds. And the desire for flexibility, especially post-COVID, where there were lots of changes, it rises right to the top, and so our customers are telling us that that peace of mind around the ability to change is really, really important. And so again, I know I've said this many times, you couple that with a peace of mind around no bag fees, no change fees, rep rewards points that don't expire. And now transferability within the new Wanna Get Away Plus fare. And it's just a really powerful package because we're taking all that worry and away from our customers. And again, I'm convinced that not only are we going to retain customers because of this policy change, we are going to win new customers, just like we did with bag fees. Andrew Watterson : And Bob, I'd also add on that we're really powered by repeat, right. People buys us, they experience us, they love us, they come back. Thank you, Dawn, for being a frequent flyer. And so I think that's different. A lot of the times, airlines look at as a one to done, a smash graph like a basic economy or something like that. People remember when it was -- they weren't treated well. And so in this environment, once again, we're getting more to the customer, they will like this, they will come back and repurchase us. And in fact, a travel credit, by definition, is a repurchase. And so that repurchase behavior is what powers all consumer businesses, especially ours. Dawn Gilbertson : Thanks so much for the color. Andrew Watterson : My pleasure. Operator : Next question will be from David Slotnick from TPG. Please go ahead. David Slotnick : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for question. Wondered if you could just share any colors or numbers or anything on the number of individual outstanding credits you have or the overall value of them, anything to that effect maybe the number that's left unused since 2020? Tammy Romo : Yes. This is Tammy. I can help you with that. In terms of the balance that represents travel issues that have been issued, what was in our air traffic liability balance at the end of the second quarter, it probably represented about 6% of that balance. So call it, between $400 million and $500 million, and that is, of course, a net of estimated breakage. So that gives you at least a ballpark. It's historically been maybe close -- maybe a little bit lighter than that, but it's not the most significant piece of our air traffic liability. David Slotnick : Okay. Thanks very much. Andrew Watterson : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Nahur Ujwani from [indiscernible] Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for doing this. I wanted to ask about talk in the local news media lately in the DSW area that Southwest will be able to expand service to without having to give a date that love field starting in 2025. I wanted to ask you directly, is adding service to DSW Airport part of your long-term plan, why or why not? . Bob Jordan : Well, the -- I mean first off, Dallas is are home. And we love serving Dallas. We were born here. The Dallas, we put a lot of money in the Dallas Love Field, basically rebuilding the airport, adding gauges, and we're very happy there. Job one is to secure the gates that we have at Love Field and all that. Love Field though, obviously, is constrained. And so we want to see -- we want to continue to serve the area. And at some point, that becomes difficult given the capacity Love field. So, it's just a general comment that as we that will look to add capacity generally to the extent that we can. There are a lot of potential ways to do that. Obviously, DFW could be a way to do that. We don't have anything in process. It's really more a comment about being able to serve the area than it is about a desire to go to DFW. And at some point, when you're constrained, you have to find a way around that. But really job one right now is to conserve \u2013 is to preserve access to Love Field. And Andrew, if you want to add anything to that? Andrew Watterson : I think it's common for us to serve multiple airports in a metro area. We do that in the Los Angeles Basin area, [indiscernible] Bay Area, Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, so that's normal for us. So, it would be normal for us to have another airport we served in a large population place like Dallas. One of our responsibilities is to create more opportunities we can prosecute. And so, we have lots of opportunities all around our system. Dallas is one of them. So, I think the point in time is not material, but it's an opportunity for us to prosecute when the timing and the facilities are right. Bob Jordan : Very well said. So yes, the issue isn't DFW, the issue is how do we continue to serve the area. That's really the issue at stake. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : And if I may follow up briefly. Are you able to share some of the benefits that you've noticed operationally for having flights out of two airports in a [indiscernible] regions? What are some of the things that can be a win-win for not only customers, but also for you at Southwest? Bob Jordan : We generally want this for our customer reason because we want customers to go to the airport. It's the convenient to them. So really when you get these big metro areas, traffic also becomes a big part of your travel plans. And especially if you fly in shorter hauls, if you're flying from across the country, you may not perceive the difference between LAX and Burbank in Long Beach in Orange County and in Ontario. But if you're flying from Denver or Northern California or Phoenix, then it can become the traffic is a material part of your journey. So, you want to fly an airport that's closer to where you're going. And so having these kind of neighborhood airports, if you will, gives our customers a better value proposition for kind of end-to-end transit. So that's the biggest driver is that kind of convenience once you're on the ground to our customers. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Bob Jordan : My pleasure. Thanks for the question. Operator : We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Virag Sakshi [ph] from the New York Times. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thank you. I apologize if you've already addressed this, but I was just curious if you're able to say anything with the Spirit, Jet Blue merger, if -- I guess I'd just be curious to hear your perspective on how that could affect the competitive landscape, how -- just anything sort of generally about how you think it might affect the industry? Bob Jordan : You love my answer because we don't comment mergers acquisition. But just generally, obviously, we have experience with these things. It's Southwest overtime. We purchased AirTran Airways. We did some things with ATA. We had more overtime. So, we have experience about once a decade or so doing something here.  I'm not going to opine on Spirit and what's happening with Frontier and JetBlue. I would just tell you how we think about it, which is we're going to compete with anybody, whoever that is. We compete vigorously every single day in every location. And so whether that's, in this case, Spirit standalone or Spirit merged with somebody else, it doesn't change the way we think about competition and what we need to do. We need to serve our customers. We need to have the best network. We need to have efficiencies like a single aircraft type. We need to have low cost that enable low fares. And I always go back to the beauty of Southwest Airlines is we have the best employees who wake up every day with a heart to serve others before they serve themselves. And that's the beauty of Southwest. And that's how we think about competition is deploying our strengths. So that would be my answer, which is no matter who it is, we're going to compete. Andrew Watterson : And I'd just add on to it. You've probably heard through the call, is talking about getting back to our efficiencies, rolling out our new products, restoring our network, reinvigorating our culture. So we control our own destiny. So we just roll this plan out, we talked about all call and we control our own estate. So we don't really need someone to do someone else in the industry to do something to avoid doing something. We control our own destiny, and so we'll prosecute that. I think that's what benefits you when you're in a position of strength Southwest Airlines. Bob Jordan : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So back to the earlier question, too, about what worries you out there like potential recession? We talk all the time internally about. We can't control the externals, but we can't control our reaction to them and how we manage ourselves here, Southwest Airlines, and that is 100% our focus. Tammy Romo : Yes. And just one thought as you were all talking, just to come back to our second quarter results, they truly were extraordinary to have a record performance. And you just think about where we come from two years ago, it's just remarkable. And we've talked a lot about our third quarter revenue performance. And while there is certainly some noise in some of the numbers, our guide was still up 8% to 12% relative to 2019. And a lot of commentary on revenues, but I do want to make sure that I was clear that when modeling our revenues going forward, you would want to use our third quarter guidance of that 8% to 12%. Just to be really clear, because I know we've done a lot of information out of you today. So it's really gratifying to think about how far we've come from 2019. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you all so much for being with us today. As usual, you can follow up with our communications department if you have any other questions or you can visit us at www.swamedia.com. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone. And welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. My name is Jamie, and I will be moderating today's conference. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.  After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, operator. And welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. In just a moment, we will share some prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on the call today we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; President, Mike Van de Ven; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. We also have a few other senior leaders in the room today including Ryan Green, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements today which are based on our current expectation of future performance. And our actual results could differ. Also, we had a few special items in our third quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to the press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information. And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : All right. Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Just really pleased to report another solid profit in the third quarter of $316 million, excluding special items were $0.50 a share. All in all, third quarter\u2019s bottom line results came in almost right in line with our expectations back in July, slightly better in fact. And that really speaks to the more stable environment that we are operating in today versus where we were just two quarters ago. While not fully recovered yet, it makes a big difference in our ability to more effectively plan, set our flight schedules and avoid revising them and deliver a more reliable operation both for our customers and our employees. That's exactly what we're doing in the second half of 2022, and that's what we plan to do going forward. Given the significant progress we've made thus far, we do not intend to republish or materially change our future flight schedules, as was necessary to do during most of the pandemic. One of our primary goals for this year is returning to consistent profitability, and we are well on our way and continue to expect a solid profit for 2022. We're coming off a record third quarter revenues and bookings appear strong as far as we can see in our booking curve. Demand trends, both volumes and yields are robust. We want to get properly staffed and that's going very well. We remain on track with adding over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we are getting much better staffed in key areas with exception of pilots where our aggressive hiring efforts continue. And we are on our track to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year as planned. We wanted to restore our operational reliability, and we are headed in the right direction, having made a lot of solid progress. As we shared previously, we restored some of our short haul flying in the third quarter, which was a little early and at the expense of revenue without knowing where business demand has ended up. But the goal was to help the operation, and I believe we got the desired result in the third quarter. Going forward, we believe we have capacity better matched to seasonally to demand in the fourth quarter, and you can see the benefit in our sequential revenue improvement from 3Q to 4Q based on our guidance. And as Michael will cover our on time performance this month has been very strong with high completion rates. And the thanks of course goes to our people who have solidly restored our customer service advantage this year. Another one of our top priorities. For January through August, the most recent data available we remain number one in customer service per the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I just so thankful for our employees and how they have worked tirelessly together as a team, no matter the obstacle, and they have us solidly back on top of the industry. Again, our employees are the central proof and essence here at Southwest Airlines that I'm just so very proud of them and all that they have done. Jet fuel prices remain high, but we are 61% hedged in the fourth quarter and continue to expect healthy hedging gains. We continue to expect both inflationary cost pressures and cost headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency in fourth quarter. This is all anticipated in our full year guidance. And other than some timing of cost between 3Q and 4Q, our cost trends have been very stable. We've been executing well on our full year 2022 cost plan since we provided our full year CASM-X guidance back in January. But for the Hurricane Ian impact to capacity, we are also executing on our full year 2022 capacity plan. Specific areas of focus for 2023 are to maintain adequate staffing and get caught up in pilot staffing, get new contracts with all labor groups currently in negotiations, fully utilize our aircraft and optimize staffing to the fleet and flight activity, ring out cost inefficiencies and improve efficiency levels and operating leverage as we fully restore the network. Our primary gating factor to growth next year continues to be pilot hiring, and I don't expect that we will be fully utilizing the fleet until late 2023. As of today, our flight schedules are published through July 10, 2023, and we feel good about our ability to fly those schedules as published and planned, despite some uncertainty around aircraft deliveries. While we expect a healthy amount of capacity growth next year, it is nearly all going back into key Southwest markets. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansion during the pandemic, and as business demand improves, we have opportunities to build those back up. And this is lower risk growth, primarily in markets where we have the number one share and a strong Southwest customer base. So we don't believe the capacity additions carry near the risk of adding a new market. Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer of 2023, we should be about 90% done. In closing, we've made tremendous progress this year. Barring any significant unforeseen impacts, we should finish this year very strong, given our fourth quarter outlook. While there is noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not, or whether we may even be in in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends. There has also been a lot of discussion about the blending of business and leisure why and where those trends may ultimately end up. But regardless, our overall revenue trends are strong and well above 2019 levels. Our work continues on developing a strong financial plan for next year, and we will share more about that at our upcoming Investor Day meeting in December. And I'm extremely proud of our employees for their dedication to the cause at Southwest Airlines. They are our greatest asset and they are our secret weapon. They are the best in the business and I know I can count on them to rally together and help us improve further in 2023. And before I turn it over to Tammy, I just want to say a big thank you to Mike. Mike has overseen the operations here at Southwest for over 16 years, and that is just a huge job and a huge task. He is a tremendous leader. I'm just very grateful Mike, for all that you do. And I'm very grateful that you will continue to work as an advisor to me and others in the future. And I also want to say a big congrats to Andrew, to Linda and to Ryan for taking on even more. I really appreciate that. And today Mike will report on operations and Andrew will report on commercial. And then beginning at our December Investor Day, Andrew will speak to operations and you will hear from Ryan regarding our commercial plans. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you Bob. And thank you Mike. My very dear friends for three decades of incredible leadership. And thanks also to all of our employees for their remarkable job throughout the quarter. In addition to delivering a high quality experience for our customers, their efforts led to a solid third quarter performance. The strong demand trends from summer continued in third quarter resulted in record third quarter revenue and record third quarter revenue passengers. Our third quarter operating revenues grew a healthy 10.3% versus 2019, aided by a very strong other revenue performance. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute. So I will turn to our cost, performance and outlook. Our people did another great job managing cost in third quarter. Our fuel hedge continues to perform well in this environment where market prices remain volatile and elevated, saving the company about $220 million in fuel expense in third quarter alone. We are 61% hedged for fourth quarter, and we currently estimate our fourth quarter fuel price to be in the $3.15 to $3.25 per gallon range, which would be a sequential improvement from third quarter's fuel price based on current prices. That estimate includes $0.37 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of more than $185 million in fourth quarter, which would put our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit at roughly $1 billion. We recently added to our 2023 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 50% hedged with a fair market value of around $390 million for full year 2023. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio through 2024 is $685 million. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 and beyond, but we are in good shape headed into next year, especially given the volatile energy market over the past year that made it tough to materially expand our positions at historical premium cost. Taking a look at non-fuel cost, third quarter CASM excluding special items and profit sharing was towards the favorable end of our previous guidance range at 12.2% compared with third quarter 2019 due to lower than anticipated health and benefit cost, as well as higher favorable airport settlements that we expected to receive this quarter, but shifted earlier to third quarter. We currently estimate fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels, compounded by decreased capacity levels here in fourth quarter relative to third quarter. The remainder of the CASM-X increase continues to be primarily attributable to inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for labor, benefits and airports. All of that said, I am very pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, as Bob mentioned, especially in this environment. As we close out the year, our full year 2022, CASM-X guidance has narrowed to up 14% to 15% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all contract labor groups beginning April 1 of this year. Taking into account our best estimate for wage rate increases. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to estimate full year CASM-X to decrease compared with this year. We now have our first half 2023 flight schedules published for sale, and we currently expect first half 2023 CASM-X to be in the range of flat to up 2% compared with first half 2022. Given the level of first half capacity growth in a pre-pandemic period, we would have expected CASM-X to be solidly down year-over-year. However, we expect to continue experiencing unprecedented cost headwinds due to higher than expected inflation and as part of that, keep in mind that we are accruing for all open labor contracts and further wage rate increases in 2023. So that is fully included in our guidance based on our best estimation of market rates. On top of wage rate inflation, we expect to continue hiring at a healthy pace next year to support 2023 capacity and scale for 2024 growth. Our productivity has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, which has required additional hiring to support the operation. It seems that most industries and companies, including our peers, are experiencing a similar workforce dynamic. Based on our assumption that fleet utilization will be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023, these cost headwinds will persist throughout next year, but should improve somewhat in second half relative to first half 2023. We haven't finalized our second half 2023 capacity plans, but our current estimation is that second half 2023 CASM-X will decrease in the low-to-mid single-digit range compared with second half 2022. We continue to be focused on better optimization of staffing levels to our flight activity and improving our efficiency metrics and operating leverage. That work will begin in 2023 and continue into 2024. Turning to our fleet, our planning assumption for Boeing aircraft deliveries this year remains unchanged from what we shared in July. While our contractual order book still reflects 114 aircraft in 2022, we continue to expect 66 -8 MAX deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with, as well as uncertainty regarding the timing of the -7 MAX certification. However, we are encouraged to have received all 23 -8 MAX aircraft in third quarter as expected and continue to expect 31 -8 MAX aircraft delivery during the fourth quarter. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We continue ongoing discussions with Boeing and just recently made some modifications to our order book. In short, we converted more -7 MAX aircraft to -8 MAX aircraft in the near-term. We outlined the specific changes in our press release this morning, so I won\u2019t reiterate all the fleet details here. In terms of retirements, we now plan to retire a total of 26 -700 aircraft this year, a few less than previously expected, ending the year with an estimated 768 aircraft in our fleet. And our full year 2022 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $4 billion. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $13.7 billion after paying $1.9 billion to retire debt and finance lease obligations during third quarter. This included the full $1.2 billion outstanding amount of our 4.75% notes due 2023 and $184 million in principal of our convertible notes. We have now repurchased a total of $689 million of our convertible notes, roughly 30% of the original issuance, and have $1.6 billion currently outstanding. We remain in a net cash position with leverage at a very manageable 48%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key long-term competitive advantages in good times and in challenging times. With our strong balance sheet and continued financial strength, we will soon discuss our 2023 capital plans with our Board of Directors, but our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have a long-standing dividend history, and reinstating a dividend remains a high priority. We will also continue to look for opportunities to reduce debt. We will continue investing in the company and our people, and we are focused on wrapping up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Last but not least, and at the right time, we intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation as we have in the past. And all of these intentions assume that the travel demand environment remains steady and we continue producing consistent quarterly profits. We are mindful of the economy and recessionary risk, and we would like to monitor the environment to see if there is any noticeable impact on travel demand as we move into 2023. Again, we are not seeing any noticeable impact today, but we would like to preserve a higher-than-normal cash balance for some period of time into next year before we materially reduce our cash reserves. So while I can\u2019t commit to anything today, I hope that gives you an idea of how we are evaluating our capital allocation choices. In closing, third quarter represented another profitable quarter in our recovery. Our momentum is building here in fourth quarter, supported by a strong revenue outlook, and I am encouraged with the progress we have made as we look to close the year strong and turn our focus to 2023. We are committed to generating healthy returns on invested capital, and I am very pleased with the direction we are headed. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Tammy. I\u2019ll provide some additional color on our Q3 revenue trends and Q4 outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Overall, Q3 operating revenues came in right in line with the mid-point of our original guidance range, up 10.3% versus Q3 2019. Our path there was a bit different than anticipated, but a solid result nonetheless. We had an 85.4% load factor, and yields increased 5.3% versus Q3 2019. In July and August, we saw a step back in close-end business demand, but that was coupled with stronger advanced purchase leisure demand. In September, we saw a nice sequential improvement in managed business revenues, and leisure demand remained stronger than anticipated and was particularly robust for a typically weaker leisure shoulder month post Labor Day. September managed business revenues finished down 25% versus Q3 2019. So while Q3 took a bit of a step back on business trends, we finished the quarter on a strong note, and revenue momentum is picking up steam. As anticipated, we had a 5-point sequential headwind from Q2 to Q3 for our travel credit expiration policy change in July, which resulted in lower breakage revenue in Q3. As Bob mentioned, we also increased our short-haul flying in Q3 in order to help with our operational stability. Mike will cover operational results in a moment. But we over-indexed some short-haul flying in Q3 relative to where business demand ended up, which created a roughly 2-point drag to Q3 operating revenue. As business demand rebound in September, the additional short-haul flying helped overall revenues, and our revenue trends in medium and long-haul segments were very strong throughout Q3. Our Q3 loyalty program revenue was exceptionally strong and the primary driver of the increase in the other revenues. We saw strong growth in retail sales, which was aided by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Even so, Q3 retail sales spend per cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue and EBIT contribution. Our ancillary products also performed well in Q3, in particular, our upgraded boarding product. This allows customers to purchase any unsold business select boarding positions in the A1 to A15 boarding group on the day of travel. We recently rolled out a new digital self-service option to purchase this product, which was previously only available to purchase at the airport gate. Our portfolio of new cities and development markets performed in line with expectations in Q3. Hawaii outperformed our expectations, primarily due to stronger Mainland to Hawaii performance as we further invested in and we optimized our Hawaii franchise. And these actions are paying off. Our Hawaii interisland service will take longer to development, and our primary goal at this point is generating awareness among local travelers and incentivize them to try Southwest and experience our product. This is not uncommon with introduction of new service. Now looking at Q4, travel demand is strengthening, and we expect both leisure and business revenue trends to improve sequentially from Q3, and bookings for the holidays are strong. We expect Q4 operating revenues to increase in the range of 13% to 17% versus Q4 2019. We expect sequential improvement in Q4 business revenue trends compared with September is down 25%, and we expect Q4 managed business revenues to be down 20% to 25% versus Q4 2019. The sequential improvement we are seeing in operating revenues is from base business improvement, in particular on the yield side, as we continue \u2013 as well as continued ramp of benefits from revenue initiatives. Our Q3 capacity decreased slightly, down 0.3% versus Q3 2019, which was in line with our guidance despite flight cancelations from Hurricane Ian. Our Q4 capacity is a little lower than previously guided due to Hurricane Ian flight cancellations and is now expected to be down approximately 2% versus Q4 2019. Stage length is increasing a bit as we move through Q4 and we continue to expect to be about 85% restored from a network perspective by this December. Looking ahead to next year, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase around 10% year-over-year and Q2 2023 capacity to increase around 14% year-over-year. While we aren\u2019t ready to provide full year 2023 capacity guidance yet, that should give you an idea of the rate of capacity growth next year. When we talk about being fully restored from a network perspective, that means restoring the key Southwest markets that we borrowed from to fund the new airport growth during the pandemic. So our year-end 2023 capacity goal would be network restoration plus our 18 new airports and recent Hawaii expansion. In closing, this will be my last earnings call covering the commercial update as our new Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, will take over going forward. I\u2019ve worked with Ryan for a long time, and he\u2019s very prepared and well qualified for his expanded role. Some of you have met Ryan in the past, but he was most recently our Chief Marketing Officer. As I\u2019m transitioning to Chief Operating Officer, I will retain the network planning function as we strive to increase operating leverage as we move past the pandemic and reconstruct the network. And being conscious that I\u2019m standing on his shoulders for my new job, I thank you, Mike, and turn it over to you. Mike Van de Ven : Well. Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We\u2019re now through the busy summer travel season. And aside from some weather that the industry had to deal with, I am very pleased with the reliability of the operations that our employees delivered in the third quarter. They\u2019re working very hard to take great care of each other and our customers. And we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in several areas, including getting properly staffed in most work groups, and we have more employees that have completed their initial training, and they\u2019re now contributing on the front line. So over 95% of our hiring has been in frontline and operations groups. Second, flying our published schedules without making material posting revisions. As Bob mentioned, our third quarter schedules were much more stable for our employees and our customers. And third, just as with last quarter, we have improved the quality of the schedule with more depth and more non-stop flights. Andrew mentioned we\u2019ve added short-haul flights in business or end markets, that provides more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We also have more flying between all of our crew bases, and all of those changes support a more stable operational performance. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, the heavy summer travel season, we improved year-over-year across nearly every operational metric, including our on-time performance. And our flight completion rate was 98.6%, which means we canceled slightly more than 1% of our scheduled flight, and that\u2019s in line with our pre-pandemic performance, and that\u2019s really where we aim to be. Digging into on-time performance for the third quarter, our on-time performance was 71.2%, which was referred to as A14 by the Department of Transportation or getting customers to their destination within 14 minutes of their scheduled arrival time. So if you look at getting our customers to their destination within 30 minutes, our on-time performance increased to 81.7%, and it was 90.4% within an hour. Well, we always want to be on time, but my point is that we are currently canceling very few flights, and we\u2019re consistently getting the vast majority of our customers to their destinations within a reasonable amount of time. We are focused on improving our A14, and we know that the primary challenge is operating tempo. And I talked about this last quarter, but I think it\u2019s worth repeating. Our operating tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires starting work. We\u2019ve got more leisure customers that are in our load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from both weather and staffing. And all of these things tend to require more time and are causing us some delays that just didn\u2019t exist pre-pandemic. However, we have made solid progress towards our historical operational results, and we\u2019re doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We aim to continue improving. We\u2019ve got great momentum here in October with our on-time performance running in the low 80% range. We continue to hire and train new employees. And that should have us well prepared for the upcoming holiday season, and we should continue just to get better as we continue our network restoration through next year and get even more employees through training. And just a couple of more thoughts on hiring and training. We continue to hire in most work groups and focused locations, and we still expect to add over 10,000 employees this year net of attrition. We just \u2013 we aren\u2019t just hiring for this year, though, we\u2019re hiring to support the spring and the summer of 2023 so that we have a more seasoned workforce in place. Our pilot hiring and training continues to be the pacing factor for growth as we move forward. We continue to attract high-quality pilot candidates, and the training program to onboard a new pilot to Southwest Airlines are robust. We\u2019re operating at our maximum training capacity for pilots, and that will continue well into 2023. And then just last, but certainly not least, I do want to congratulate my friend, Andrew Watterson, for his new role as Chief Operating Officer. I\u2019ve been doing that role for almost 17 years, and I know Andrew is well prepared to take on this role. I know he\u2019s going to continue driving to modernize the operation. He\u2019s going to bring a new perspective and energy that will serve our company well. And I\u2019m looking forward to transition into an executive adviser role early next year and assisting Bob and the Southwest team on a variety of matters as needed. I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. I especially want to say thank you to the entire operations team that I\u2019ve been a part of and have had the pleasure to support all these years. Southwest is truly a championship team, and I am grateful that I will continue to be a part of it. So with that, Ryan, I will turn it back over to you. Ryan Martinez : Well, thank you, Mike. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder to please, keep your questions to one and a follow-up if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions. Andrew Didora : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Tammy, two quick questions on cost here. I know you\u2019ve been accruing for labor most of this year. But do any of the \u2013 does the recent deal from one of your peers change in any way how you accrue for your agreements going forward? And then second, on costs, does the low single-digit CASM growth that you outlined at last Investor Day after 2023 still seem reasonable in the current environment? Tammy Romo : Yes. Thank you, Andrew, for your question. And yes, we\u2019ve taken into consideration all of the current labor deals as we\u2019ve contemplated our accruals here. So all of that has been baked into the guidance that we\u2019ve shared with you. And in terms of the \u2013 our investor \u2013 the goal set \u2013 our longer-term goal set we laid out with you at Investor Day, I think we\u2019re in line \u2013 still in line with those longer-term goals. So clearly, we\u2019ve had some choppiness here in terms of the rate that we\u2019re bringing back aircraft and employees and restoring the network. So that created some lumpiness in our cost trends. But we\u2019ve done our very best here, at least looking ahead for 2023, to include all of those inflationary pressures and the guidance that we provided to you this morning. Bob Jordan : Hey, Andrew. This is Bob. Yes, I agree with Tammy. The goals stand. The \u2013 if you\u2019re thinking that \u2013 you saw we noted that deliveries as an example only, some of this delivery \u2013 these delivery issues with Boeing could persist into 2024, so you could still be, to some extent, wringing out some of the inefficiencies that are caused by some of that and just still folks entering training, going back to \u2013 going out under the line. Some of that could persist early into 2024, but no, absolutely, all the goals stand. Andrew Didora : Got it. Understood. Then second, Tammy, nearly $14 billion in cash on the balance sheet. With the move in rates, just \u2013 how are you investing this cash? And how should we think about interest income going forward into 4Q? Because it looks like it\u2019s reaching a level where it offsets your interest expense. So any color there would be great. Thanks. Tammy Romo : Yes. No, great question. You\u2019re absolutely right. We saw an improvement in our other expenses as we\u2019ve seen rates improve here. So yes, no, we are investing that cash in obviously what we consider to be secure investments, but we do expect interest income to continue to outpace interest expense. Andrew Didora : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask about the 4Q RASM acceleration. It\u2019s different than others, but I guess your third quarter deceleration was different than others. Is this just noise around breakage from Q3? Or is there some real underlying acceleration strengthening in the RASM trend Q4 versus Q3? Bob Jordan : Hey, Scott. I\u2019ll just start for just a second, and I\u2019ll let Andrew chime in here. There is a little noise between the quarters, but I think really it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s the continued strengthening in the underlying business. You\u2019ve got leisure trends, which are really strong. And there\u2019s been all kinds of talk about what\u2019s going on there, the blending of leisure and business and everything. We are seeing leisure strength in what would have been typically off-peak period. As just an example only, in a typical period or a typical year, September would have been two to three load factor points under the summer just sequentially. And this year, we didn\u2019t see that. So there were about two to three points above that sequential trend. So the leisure traffic is really, really strong. Coming off, we did have a dip in business in July and August, and then we got those trends reversed in September, and we expect to see strengthening in the fourth quarter from September\u2019s down 25%. So no, you\u2019re seeing \u2013 it\u2019s more about the continued strength in leisure and business revenues in the fourth quarter than it is noise. Andrew? Andrew Watterson : What I\u2019d add is, yes, we had some company-specific drags in Q3 that have either gone away or attenuated. And at the same time, we saw some business travel weakness there during the summertime, which was unexpected. But then as we exit the summer, we saw business travel pick back up. And business travel, in general, has had a nice line \u2013 trend line of restoration from post vaccines till today, but it\u2019s had some kind of ups and downs unexpected times. And it took kind of a down, as Tammy said, during early Q3, and now it\u2019s kind of ticked back up. And so that combined with some of the actions we took on a little bit less short haul that we sent out, I think those things combined and showed us good both volume and yield acceleration from Q3 to Q4. Scott Group : Okay. And then, Tammy, your comments about wanting to keep elevated cash, is that sort of a signal don\u2019t expect much in terms of buyback dividend or don\u2019t expect much in terms of size of buyback dividend? I\u2019m just \u2013 if there\u2019s any sort of more color you want to share there. Tammy Romo : Yes, I covered that pretty well in my remarks. Obviously, we want to get back to our long-standing tradition of healthy shareholder returns. And we continue to be thoughtful in our capital allocation decisions. Clearly, we want to drive future growth and value. As you\u2019re aware, the PSP restrictions on dividends and share repurchases just expired at the end of the third quarter. And we\u2019ll \u2013 as we look ahead to December, we\u2019ll discuss our 2023 plans with you in more detail, but I would just say that our capital allocation priorities really haven\u2019t changed. And as I said earlier, we have a long-standing dividend history, so reinstating a dividend continues to be a high priority for us. As we\u2019ve been doing here this year, we\u2019ve been looking for opportunities to reduce our debt, and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities that make sense for us there. And importantly, we continue to invest in our company and our people and are certainly focused on wrapping up our negotiation of all of our open labor contracts. And at the right time, it will \u2013 we do intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation, just like we have done in the past. So we\u2019re just trying to balance all of that. And again, not to \u2013 I think it is important to repeat, we just \u2013 all of this assumes that the demand environment remains steady. And certainly, we haven\u2019t seen any step back here as we are talking to you today, but we\u2019ll want to continue to monitor the environment. But so far, so good on that front. And we\u2019ll just keep you apprised of our plans as we update them. Scott Group : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Jamie Baker : Hey, good afternoon everybody. So Tammy, a follow-up to Andrew\u2019s question and just so I understand the accrual mechanism. Hypothetically, if American and United ratified pilot contracts tomorrow with a 30% date of signing increase \u2013 I\u2019m being deliberate here \u2013 you would upwardly adjust your accrual to reflect that? Or is it just a set it and forget it metric in your model? Tammy Romo : I\u2019m not going to speculate with you, Jamie, on any particular percentages, but we certainly take labor contracts and what market rates in \u2013 as an input into our accruals. So we do monitor those and do our best job to estimate labor rates. But obviously, there are estimations involved with that. But it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 we evaluate that every quarter and update as we feel is necessary, which is what we\u2019ve been doing really starting back in the beginning of the second quarter. Jamie Baker : Yes, I didn\u2019t need to throw you off with the percentage. I was just being dramatic for the data. But I did miss it. You say you do or you don\u2019t upgrade or update it every quarter to reflect what\u2019s going on in the market? Tammy Romo : We do. Jamie Baker : You do. Okay. Perfect. And then second, when listing priorities, both in your prepared remarks and in the last question, you tend to emphasize labor deals, and then you bring up the topic of capital returns. Is that deliberate? Or put differently, should we view labor deals as one of the criteria you need to achieve before reinstating capital returns? Or am I reading just too much into it? Bob Jordan : Yes. Jamie, this is Bob. And again, we\u2019re going to be talking with our Board in the next month about just capital returns, and then we\u2019ll be sharing a lot more of this with you at our Investor Day in December. I don\u2019t know that you can be that prescriptive in terms of the exact order, but it\u2019s very important for us to get these labor deals done. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 I think we have great employees. We want to reward them. They\u2019re highly paid today. We want them to be even more \u2013 even better paid. You\u2019re starting to see deals by others. You\u2019re starting to see us get some TAs out there. So I think it\u2019s clear the high priority would be the dividend restoration. And then as you\u2019ve seen us, we\u2019ve had opportunities to take \u2013 to reduce debt, which we\u2019ve done. But no, the \u2013 getting our labor deals done is a very high priority for our people. Jamie Baker : Okay. That\u2019s great. The bump, it sounds, obviously, like your answer as well, too. Sorry about that. Thank you. Bob Jordan : You may have a package on the porch. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thank you, everyone. Great to see the traction on the operational reliability there after, obviously, a little over a year of trying. So I just wanted to get a sense of how robust or fragile that is given \u2013 like if we had a really bad winter storm or there was a huge surge in travel like for \u2013 like one or two days during Thanksgiving or something, do you feel like there\u2019s enough slack in the system to be able to support some of that? Bob Jordan : Ravi, this is Bob. I want to just add one couple of topside things, then Mike could talk about the details. But I think there are several things in here that are just macro helping drive the operational improvement. Number one is getting staffed. I mean, when you\u2019re understaffed, it affects everything, you don\u2019t have margin to deal with any kind of issue, and we are so much better staffed today than we were even three to four months ago. Obviously, we have a ways to go with our pilots. But really, what\u2019s happening there is we just aren\u2019t \u2013 we are just under-flying our aircraft because of that. The other big thing is we committed, I think, late in the spring, early in the summer, we committed to not republishing our schedules any longer because it\u2019s really hard on our employees, it\u2019s very hard on our customers. And then republishing just \u2013 it\u2019s part of what adds operational difficulty. So post the summer, we are committed to not republishing schedules, and you\u2019ve seen improvement operationally in September and a real improvement here in October. I think our OTP in October is low 80s and our NPS scores are in the 60s. And so yes, you\u2019re always going to have IROPs, but I think the base stability of the operation is much better for those reasons. But Mike? Mike Van de Ven : Yes. Ravi, I don\u2019t have much to add there. But we\u2019ve been very purposeful in trying to make sure that we match our resources to our schedules for the whole year. And we\u2019ve had really good experience over the summer in difficult weather conditions with high load factors, all the kind of things that would be an operational challenge during the holidays, and we were \u2013 we navigated through all of them very stably. So I feel like we\u2019re really set up to perform well over the holidays as we go into Thanksgiving and the Christmas season. Ravi Shanker : Very encouraging. And maybe just a follow-up. I apologize if I missed this, but you guys introduced a new fare class structure a few months ago. What\u2019s the update on that? What\u2019s the take rate like? And how much of a boost could that be to TRASM? How much are we seeing already? And how much could it be in 2023? Andrew Watterson : It\u2019s Andrew. The new fare product, Wanna Get Away Plus, is one we talked about at Investor Day last year, and we rolled out in Q2. It was part of the bundle of initiatives we said next year would give us about between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of EBIT. So we didn\u2019t break out the line item for that nor do we break out the take rate. What I have said and will say again is that the large majority of our customers will still buy the anchor Wanna Get Away, so this allows us to have more bite-sized sell-ups for additional features that customers will only pay for and don\u2019t have a huge cost of delivery for us. So some intangible costs, but don\u2019t have a big cost for delivery. And we have a cross-functional team whose job it is, is to take that product, which was delivered exceptionally well from a technical perspective, and move it to our inside target take rate for the customers. They\u2019re making great progress on that. They\u2019ve already done a different \u2013 taking different actions on merchandising and on price and how they communicate to customers. And so we are seeing really good progress. It\u2019s on its track to hit the business case, and we couldn\u2019t be happy with it. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Bob Jordan : My pleasure. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Please ask your question. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey thanks. Andrew, since this is your last call on commercial, I wanted to ask you a revenue question. So just longer term, how do you think about the stickiness of yields in the context of an inflationary environment? Do you think people should still be indexing their thinking to 2019? Or has the world changed? And how much of the yield environment would you attribute to capacity deficiency? How are you thinking about the new normal here? Andrew Watterson : Well, I appreciate the philosophical question on my last revenue call. But I think entire 2019 comps, so hopefully, next year, we\u2019ll start talking about 2019. You do have a supply-demand mismatch right now in the industry. And you have a bounce-back from this recession that was stronger than any other recession that kind of I recall. And certainly, going back maybe one of the 1980s, early 1980s, those recessions had a we [ph] like this, but it was extraordinary. So it\u2019s unusual do you have demand quickly outstripping supply like this. So it\u2019s going to take a while, I think, for the industry to have supply come back up. Because whether you have economic softness for next quarter, next year, whatever, it will keep chugging along and generating more demand. And given that some airlines are having trouble getting pilots and the airframers are having trouble kind of meeting their target delivery dates, it\u2019s going to \u2013 supply is going to be hard to come by at an industry level for a couple of years now. So, I think we have a couple of years where demand and supply may not be as aligned as it was pre-pandemic, which I think will have these yield tailwinds for a while. So that\u2019s about as far as I think one can reasonably see in this industry, but definitely a couple of years of supply headwinds and demand tailwinds. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe for Bob or whoever wants it, Southwest is a margin-focused company, in our opinion. But in any given year, you might have different priorities. So what is your guiding light for 2023 growth? Are you solving for margin expansion next year? Or has this COVID recovery been so unique that the goal is sort of capacity restoration and we\u2019ll worry about margin expansion beyond this 2023 transition year? Bob Jordan : Duane, I think they all hang together. So, we \u2013 I mean we\u2019ve got several goals. We need to continue to restore our ops reliability. We\u2019ve got to get staff, that\u2019s really pilots, next year so that we can fly our whole fleet. That enables the ability to restore the network. In other words, get all the stuff that we flew pre-pandemic back into the network. We\u2019ll be sort of 90% restored this summer. We think 100% fully restored by the end of next year 2023. Why that\u2019s important is because that capacity is going back into markets that we were in, so they\u2019re going into markets that we are very strong in, we have a strong customer base. So it comes on at much less risk than opening a new market. So that ties into the revenue performance in the margin discussion, because it helps. The \u2013 but no, the goal \u2013 on top of those goals in 2023, the goal is to grow revenues, to grow profits, to grow margins and to grow returns. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate the thoughts. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your question. Conor Cunningham : Hey everyone. Thank you for the time. You talked a fair bit about just training in general, and it seems like that\u2019s one of your biggest problems from a pilot standpoint. I\u2019m just \u2013 is there anything you can do to bolster the throughput there? Like I feel like this has been an issue for a while, and I\u2019m just surprised that it hasn\u2019t been fixed, but like there hasn\u2019t been a better solution in the near term that could drive some efficiencies there. Bob Jordan : Yes. Conor, I just want to clear up, sometimes it\u2019s confusing between hiring and training. We were having not \u2013 we\u2019re having \u2013 I just want to point this out. We\u2019re not having any trouble hiring pilots. We\u2019re getting all the pilots, good, great pilots that we need. We\u2019re overbooking classes as an example. That\u2019s different than getting everybody through the training process. There\u2019s just a max capacity. We have a lot of simulators, like we have 23? Andrew Watterson : 26. Bob Jordan : 26. We\u2019re adding three here. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of simulators, but the training pipeline is full. You \u2013 Andrew talking about the whole industry being constrained. I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on in the industry is this constraint to the \u2013 to some extent, hiring for some carriers, but really the training processes. So if you ask about what can you do about it, it\u2019s really difficult because the lead time on a simulator is years, as an example. So by the time you get that in, you don\u2019t need it any longer in terms of managing this bubble. So \u2013 but the main point is the hiring is going great. The training is full. Our plan this year was to hire 1,200 pilots, and we will hit that. The plan next year is to hire 2,100 pilots, and we will hit that. And then the plan is to have sort of the pilots catch the aircraft late next year so that we\u2019re flying the whole fleet, and that will be our plan. Mike, do you want to add anything? Mike Van de Ven : Yes, I\u2019ll just jump in, Connor. So yes, our training throughput, we\u2019re at maximum training throughput with all of the infrastructure that we have. So, we\u2019ve got, I think, 26 bays. We\u2019ll have 26 simulators in there at the beginning of the year. We\u2019re fully staffed on flight instructors to go do that. We\u2019ve got enough check airmen to go do that. So, we\u2019re just hiring a lot of new pilots. We\u2019ve got a lot of captain upgrades. And we have the normal recurrent training. So, we\u2019ll be at maximum training capacity in 2023, and then it falls off, as Bob mentioned, in 2024 and beyond there. So, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re putting as many pilots through our system as we can. Andrew Watterson : And I have to compliment Mike and Tammy on this. In the middle of the pandemic, where people are focused on day-to-day, they made the decision to expand our training facility by putting in more bays, to order simulators when no one else is doing either. So when we came out, we actually have more training capacity now than we had pre-pandemic by quite a bit. And so even though we\u2019re at capacity, this capacity was added during the pandemic when everyone else was thinking about today, they were thinking about tomorrow. Conor Cunningham : I appreciate that detail. And just \u2013 sorry, I\u2019d like to piggyback on Duane\u2019s margin question. But \u2013 so you still have a fair bit of inefficiencies in the 2023 and some of your hedge benefits probably roll off. So, we\u2019re kind of banking on revenue being really strong. And I\u2019m not really asking about forward pricing, but is there any other levers out there outside of revenue that could drive sustained profits higher next year that just people aren\u2019t thinking about? I appreciate it. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Well, you\u2019ve got again strong revenue performance, and that\u2019s for a number of reasons. The other thing, you\u2019ve got our initiatives coming fully online, as Andrew pointed out. So the contribution is sort of [indiscernible] EBITDA in 2023, and we\u2019ve been right on track, hitting the contributions that we told you about in terms of our revenue initiatives. We have work to do on the cost front. Some of our cost pressures are what everybody is seeing, their inflation, in particular, wage inflation, some other categories. Another piece of that are inefficiencies that again, I would argue, almost everybody is seeing. They\u2019re just folks in training, not flying all your fleet, just not back to the efficiency levels that you were pre-pandemic. And so we\u2019ve got an opportunity to work on \u2013 we talked to you about this, especially in the operations area, is tools, processes, ways to take cost out of our \u2013 of the operation, in particular, and we\u2019ll be sharing a lot of that at Investor Day here in December. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. Savi Syth : Hey, good afternoon. Can I ask on the managed business revenue? Is the decline that you saw from June, is that a function of pricing? Or is that volumes as well? Because I know you gave a revenue kind of outlook here. And I\u2019m guessing pricing has been softer just generally from kind of the earlier in the summer. Andrew Watterson : Yes, Savi, it\u2019s Andrew. We did see coming out from June to July and August, both some volume and yield softness in managed business, which then turned around in September and in October. And so it was clearly different behavior. As I mentioned before, there\u2019s been kind of the start-stop, start-stop of managed business from kind of post-vaccine rollout. And it\u2019s hard to get \u2013 be super clear on exactly the drivers are, but we do hear lots of anecdotes over the summer of companies reinstating PTO caps. Therefore, people had to take PTO during the summer. Also, many companies put in place kind of hybrid work, but then had remote July, where you could kind of work remotely for the month of July. And therefore, you don\u2019t travel for business reasons. So lots of these anecdotes fit with a summer slowdown in travel, but then resume post Labor Day with a nice tick-up post Labor Day, and that trend continued to accelerate from September into October. So not too much about why, but it was clear this is what happened and both volume and fare are improving now for managed business as we exit the summer. Savi Syth : That\u2019s helpful. And if I might, I know that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around delivery, but I\u2019m wondering if you could put a guardrail around 2023 capacity plans or just even a guardrail around maybe what you could see in terms \u2013 what you think is realistic in terms of kind of fleet delivery from a low end and a high end. Andrew Watterson : I think what Bob said earlier that we\u2019re pilot-constrained until the end of next year. So a lot of what we\u2019re doing for the bulk of next year is really paced by our pilot training capacity, not by Boeing deliveries. Obviously, these are much more efficient aircraft about to fly, but it\u2019s not the delivery rate that\u2019s really constraining 2023 for the bulk of the year. Bob Jordan : And I think of \u2013 you\u2019ve also got \u2013 this is the way to think about the capacity that we\u2019ve given you. So, we\u2019ve given you the 10% in the first quarter and the 14% in the second quarter, probably gives you some guidance out of \u2013 we\u2019re not ready to offer 2023 full year capacity, but to give you some way maybe think about that. Another just \u2013 it wasn\u2019t exactly your question, but just to tie to that, when you think about the capacity for the first half of the year, the vast majority of that is just carryover from capacity that was implemented in 2022. I think, Andrew, it\u2019s upwards of 90%. Andrew Watterson : Yes, just around 90%. Bob Jordan : So you got about 90% of that capacity is just stuff that\u2019s carried over from things that were added back as we restore the network in 2022, if that helps. The \u2013 I agree with Andrew on the delivery front. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t see a scenario right now where the Boeing deliveries are reduced to the point where somehow that limits our ability to put into place the capacity that we want. Because, again, we\u2019re pilot-constrained in all likelihood through the end of the year. So we \u2013 again, our intent is we publish schedules, our intent through the middle of the summer our intent is to fly those. I don\u2019t think those will be affected by any delivery issues. And I do expect to, like all companies, as the year moves along next year, I don\u2019t want to speak for Boeing, but as you continue to work on supply chain, whether that\u2019s engine or parts or whatever, I would assume they\u2019ll begin to stabilize those deliveries. And so no, I don\u2019t think it will have an impact on 2023. Savi Syth : That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you. Bob Jordan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess can we stay on this topic of being constrained by pilots and network recovery? Because I think if we\u2019re reading your op stats correctly, you actually have a lower average stage length now than you did in the past. So I get it, maybe the composition of the city pairs is not the same as the past, but it would seem some of that long-haul flying that was challenging you in the past maybe is coming out of the mix here. So, can you just help us understand like where are you scaled from a pilot perspective today? If you could have everyone trained, like how large of a fleet could you fly? And how much more could you scale capacity from here? Bob Jordan : I think it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not a \u2013 we\u2019ve changed the network is the driver. It\u2019s we have \u2013 we picked an order in which we have restored capacity. And so we chose to restore some of the short-haul earlier this year, a little bit of a bet on business recovery, a lot of bet of that helps the operational reliability, which is what we\u2019re seeing here in the last few months, which is different than we\u2019ve got a different network post-pandemic. And so I think it\u2019s really the order of restoration. And I\u2019m not sure this is exactly answering your question. But if we could fly all of our aircraft, that is we had enough pilots to fly the aircraft on property we would be roughly five, six, seven, eight higher persons of capacity or ASMs this year right now. That's about how much more we could fly. It's really more that's the factor than it is the mix of the flying short haul, medium haul long haul but Andrew, are want to add anything? Andrew Watterson : That's true. We from last summer through last winter we had a much longer stage length because we had fewer short haul that did hurt. We determine the network stability. A bad day could become a very bad day and so to hedge against that we restored the short haul sooner than we would've otherwise paced it based on demand in starting Q2 of this year. And that has proven a robust decision because when we've had bad days and with a lot of bad days over the summer, we operated just fine, got through them in contrast to some of our competitors. Now that does lead to a kind of imbalanced network where the stage length is much shorter as you point out and so when we talk about restoration, we're essentially talking about adding in longer haul, medium to longer haul departures from now through the end of next year to fully restore the network. It'll bring a back-up balance but well, I won't say we'll have every city payer have the same number of frequency we had before. We will \u2013 every city will have its kind of pre-pandemic network as far as or it's serving customers who want to fly for business, visiting friends and relatives and holidays. So I think you'll see a kind of regular Southwest network stage length and composition by the end of next year. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate the response. And just maybe a quick follow for Tammy. So the outlook for improved full-year CASM-X in 2023, I guess that's really not that contingent on Boeing deliveries then, right? It sounds like it's more the pilot training issue is the biggest constraint? Tammy Romo : That yes, I think that is a fair assessment and how our ability to bring on that capacity. So yes, I would agree with that. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from SIG. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Good afternoon. So Bob, I was wondering if you could give some color on how your strategy in Hawaii has evolved now over the last three or so years. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks about incentivizing travelers to try Southwest. And I realize that the \u2013 that fair special is in place through the end of the year, but should we think that that level of pricing, which is clearly unsustainable, could persist, perhaps not at that absolute level, but as you talk about incentivizing or making travelers aware of Southwest, that that level of pricing could persist into next year? Andrew Watterson : Its Andrew, I'll start off and then Bob can correct me where he needs to. Obviously we won't talk about forward pricing, but what I will say is the current pricing is we have a special and in effect since really at the end of summer where we have a low price and we guarantee that low price for customers. This is not at all in common. You look back over Southwest's history and we've done this many, many times. So it's not unusual that we do this to incent trials. Kind of to work backwards here. Bob and I were there this past summer, met with a lot of customers, a lot of stakeholders, and we saw we're aware of Southwest, they knew us, they didn't know about us too much. They had not tried us as much. And so to kind of incent that trial we had this low far and we had it available all the time just to make it really easy for people to try us and we've seen a kind of explosive growth and use by the local customer to fly us for travel between the islands. The travel between the island is much reduced from what it was before that, that's because the mainland travel from vacation has come back to its pre-pandemics levels, but it had not come back interisland. In general, when we were visiting people we're not traveling in interisland as much as they used to back before it was a monopoly. And so we wanted to get people back in the habit of traveling to Neighbor Island. It was a family to go to football games for all the reasons one might in the mainland getting your car and drive. And so it was really about getting people used to a different behavior, which is you can count on low prices between the islands, and once you got them \u2013 get them back knowing that they can adjust how they're going to allocate their budget, what they're going to do on the weekends. And we think that ultimately ends up to having a more robust interisland market compared to before when it was characterized by high prices and monopoly service. So we think this is a pathway onto that. Now, our schedule also at the same time been changed. Our entry into Hawaii, we viewed it as a franchise, and that franchise includes mainland, offline as well as Neighbor Island flying and we kind of dimensionalize that based on customer feedback. So we went out to Hawaii well before we started flying, and we heard from people, yes, it's great you're going to fly from the mainland Southwest, but can you please give us interisland travel? We heard all kinds of sad stories of not being able to visit friends and relatives. And so we came and we put that back into our business plan. We figured out a good network that would provide good robust reliability and customer options to have some very short mainland \u2013 very short interisland flying and some long haul mainland flying. And the combination looks good on paper to us. We've kind of adjusted that based on feedback. We heard from a lot of the local customers, please fly to Vegas. So we added Vegas to it. They said, hey, Southwest, it's great you're offering options but I need more \u2013 a better schedule so I can get back home because if you've ever been to Maui, they have very nice hotels, but they're quite expensive. So if you're a business traveler you don't stay over, you come back home. And so you look at that and you think of business travelers as your white collar workforce, which is true in Hawaii, but they also have a blue collar workforce that travels for business construction workers, dock workers, trades people and so they need to be able to get back home each night when they go Neighbor Island to serve their customers. So that led us to having a bit more of a schedule offering that kind of span the day so people could have that that round trip ability. And because we had started off with a little bit more of a looser schedule in Hawaii, because it was very new to us to fly such long stage link, we were able to kind of tighten up our, our scheduling parameters and really didn't use a whole bunch more new aircraft and new crew time because both were there and just not as productive. So we're able to kind of increase that offering without a lot of cost to us. So this all fits down to, I think a franchise that's maturing. We love it, and I think our product fits with the local customers and they're responding and droves by our introductory offer. Bob Jordan : Yes. I would just say, yes, Andrew and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Hawaii in May, and it was \u2013 it's clear that people love us, but they don't all know us. And this gives us a chance to introduce ourselves. It was also really clear, a much better inter island schedule was something they really wanted and needed. And the last thing I would just say, I've been with Southwest 34 years and we've gone in \u2013 in my time we've gone into lots and lots of new markets, new cities, and grown some of those to what today are \u2013 what we would call mega stations. And using introductory pricing to really introduce ourselves to the market and drive traffic is a \u2013 it's a tactic that we have used very successfully here for years and years and years and this is very similar. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Okay, thank you. And my follow up. So if we look at U.S. domestic capacity in the first half of next year narrow bodies, this is for the U.S. as a whole now. Narrow bodies are up low double digits, wide bodies up a few points. RJ is down obviously not completely relevant to you, but as we think about the capacity plans that you outlined for the first half, but also the yield environment for next year is the base case scenario that this mix of equipment for U.S. domestic travel as a whole normalizes or perhaps just in an easier way that these narrow and wide bodies return to their more natural markets? Thank you. Bob Jordan : I've really \u2013 I can't speak to the industry and what their plans are. I think if you look ahead especially with aircraft, if you look ahead at in sort of the intermediate term in terms of capacity, as Andrew noted, a lot of carrier's capacity will remain moderated for a while here. We suspect that because of the same pilot constraints that we have, but it does look like it'll remain moderated for a while. And I'll go back to what I said in terms of [indiscernible], so how that, what kind of interacts with the yield environment I think we'll just have to see. But the best guess would be that for a while here you do have moderated overall capacity. Again, if you look at us, we've got more capacity growth, a lot of that is carry over, but it is nearly all back into markets that we served pre-pandemic, served successfully have an established customer base. And so we see that as very different than going putting all the service into new markets that then have to be developed. So those will \u2013 that's why the plans next year continued expansion of the revenue, plan continuing expansion of margins, continuing expansions of profits. So I see those things a little bit differently. But now we can't manage the industry environment. All we can do is manage Southwest Airlines. Mike Van de Ven : I would say that the \u2013 Bob says we're going back into the market frame before we know there is travel demand, we know that we normally would service that travel demand, yet we're unable to at this point in time. So we know the demand is there, right? So we'll put the supply up against that demand. We think that makes us to be quite low risk. It's clear that other carriers are having trouble scheduling all \u2013 or servicing all of their RJs. And so their regional flying is down right now, you look into Ford schedules, it kind of pops back up. So obviously they are not going to get regional pilots and in a cliff change here next year. So, it's unlikely that the capacity is kind of out there and regional flying can actually be serviced. So you imagine that would come down as they true up their plans. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thanks so much and good afternoon everyone. I just have two questions on labor, if that's okay. So first, when we think about your net new hires for 2022 it's about 10,000 folks or 15% of the workforce will have less than one year of experience. So how do we think about the timing of getting those employees up to speed, and is there a CASM impact associated with that for 2023? Tammy Romo : Yes. We thought about all of that as we've shared our guidance with you this morning. But yes, there is certainly an impact as we hire new employees. There is some dilution as a result of that that that offset somewhat some of the inflation that we're seeing, of course. But on the other hand, there is a penalty, if you will, because we're continuing to hire to fund future growth. So, there is that probably washes itself out a bit as we look ahead into 2023. Bob Jordan : And I think some of that proficiency question, which we've been asked a lot is probably different by work group. So you take a pilot and they out of training and you've got two pilots in the cockpit and you are proficient. In other words, you're not becoming more productive over time. You are flying the aircraft and you are fully proficient. Other jobs, on the ramp, for example, you're trained, but it takes a long time to understand the nuance of the job. You're paired with somebody else. Mike uses the word get our tempo back. You're just slow at first, scanning bags, that kind of thing. So you got other jobs that over time we will gain efficiency and as folks in those jobs get their tempo or their full proficiency back. So I think it does vary by work group. But there is opportunity for sure, opportunity for sure in 2023 to begin to ring those efficiencies out of the operation. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, that's helpful. And then just another follow-up on labor. I think at the Analyst Day in 2021, you targeted 80 employees per aircraft, and we've seen that step up to, to 86 per aircraft today. Granted, that's hiring ahead of the aircraft coming in. So how do we think about that level normalizing? Bob Jordan : Well, we'll be sharing a lot of this in December at Investor Day. I think that normalization of that number is being affected by a number of things. It's just, again, it's the inefficiency in the system that will take, I think, all of 2023 to ring that out. It will take flying all of our aircraft, it will take becoming proficient. It's also going to take modernization of some of our tools and processes \u2013 and again, we're going to share a lot of this stuff using new tools and processes, taking paper out of the turn so that it takes less labor in some areas as an example to perform the same tasks. We also have to take a look on the other side of things, like if we're going to continue to take, I'm just making this up, but the MAX 8 for a while, like we have been in, in lieu of the -7, well, it takes an extra flight attendant to manage that aircraft. And so we\u2019re going to have to just think about the 80 in that context. But the goal remains to be efficient in terms of employees per aircraft. And we\u2019ll share an update on our thinking and then how to close that gap at our December Investor Day. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Awesome. Thanks. Mike Van de Ven : Thank you. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Jamie, and welcome to the members of the news media to our call today. We can go ahead and jump right into our Q&A. So Jamie, if you would just give them some queuing instructions, we\u2019ll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead with your question. Alison Sider : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much. I guess on the MAX 7 certification, just curious if you could share anything. When did it become clear to you that, that certification wasn\u2019t going to happen this year? And sort of how did you find out about it? And anything you could share about kind of your reaction as that situation has evolved? Mike Van de Ven : Yes, Alison, this is Mike. We talked to Boeing continuously, and they\u2019re working diligently with the FAA to provide the information we need to get the airplane certified. And at this point in time, Boeing believes that there\u2019s a chance to get certified at the end of this year or early next year. And so that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t have anything other to add \u2013 anything more to add other than that. Alison Sider : And I guess has there been any like the prior the frustration regarding reports that Boeing sort of have gotten behind in some of the certification paperwork or some of the submissions were incomplete and the FAA\u2019s reaction to that? Mike Van de Ven : Well, there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s a new process; both Boeing and the FAA to go through. So when you just think about trying to go through the process with all the information, first of all, you want to have a format of that information to flow to the FAA with. And then you agree on that, they need to gather all of that information and submit it. There\u2019s an analysis that needs to be done and there\u2019s questions. And I think all of that just takes time, and it\u2019s brand-new and they haven\u2019t had to do it before. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Silk : Yes, thanks for taking my call. So some of the other \u2013 the big three carriers that have been talking about a little bit of narrowing of demand, the variation in demand across days of the week and even across hours of the day due to hybrid work schedules and leisure travel. Are you all seeing any of that? Andrew Watterson : I think every \u2013 after every recession, business travel demand changes, behavior changes a little bit. So we should expect this time for it to change as well. So we did see during COVID, when business travel was much reduced, we did see leisure travel and periods where you often didn\u2019t see it before. So you still have more leisure travel in July than you do in September. The surprise finding is there\u2019s more leisure travel in September than it used to be. And now during COVID, that led to kind of more \u2013 you had peaks and valleys that were kind of more prevalent in COVID because of the absence of business demand. Now as business demand comes back, as we discussed earlier, and that leisure demand is staying. And that\u2019s a surprise. It\u2019s not the case that, as we rotate out of the pandemic and go back into the office, that leisure demand goes away in the off period time. It appears to stick. And so that\u2019s quite welcome. And so that does tend to dampen some level of seasonality, but you\u2019re still going to have that seasonality. It\u2019s a welcome development and \u2013 but they\u2019re still going to have peak season and off-peak season. Bob Jordan : And Robert, the only thing I would add, I do think it\u2019s interesting, I mean these are new phenomenon, right? So these \u2013 some of this \u2013 the leisure strength has been with us for a long time now coming out of COVID. We\u2019ve had very strong leisure. But the sort of the shifting of leisure into some of the prior off peak periods and strength in typically off months like a September and day a week and all those things, they\u2019re noticeable. You can see them, and they\u2019re real. What I think we want to be careful with is trying to decide that this is forever. I think as we continue \u2013 as the business travel continues to restore and as people\u2019s work habits, if that\u2019s a piece of this, as they continue to move, I think it\u2019s going to take a while for all of this to settle down, and I do think it continues to change. So I would \u2013 I\u2019ve personally been slow to decide that we have a new trend, and that\u2019s the trend for a long period of time. What\u2019s really \u2013 what we\u2019re focused on is whatever the why and this idea of blending business and leisure, the trends are really good. The leisure trends are really strong. The business trends have come out of that dip and they are strengthening. So our revenue trends overall are really strong. They\u2019re strengthening further in the fourth quarter. I think we think they\u2019ll strengthen further in 2023. So that\u2019s the focus versus trying to understand in exact detail whether some of these things are forever. Robert Silk : Okay, thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Robert. Operator : And our next question comes from David Slotnick from TPG. Please go ahead with your question. David Slotnick : Hi, all thanks very much for the question. Thinking about just MAX 7, are you \u2013 do you have a contingency or a Plan B for it\u2019s not certified this year and if Congress chooses not to pass the ICAS extension? Mike Van de Ven : Well, David, Boeing is very confident that they\u2019ve got a path to either certification or an extension. And I believe that that\u2019s going to happen as well. But if for some reason, by the off chance it doesn\u2019t happen, of course, we have plan Bs, but we\u2019re just not publicly discussing them at this point. Andrew Watterson : And as Bob talked, we can easily tolerate that next year. In fact, our network plan and business plan for next year assumes no MAX 7 deliveries. And so you\u2019ve already figured out that we can operate 2023, just fine with all MAX 8 and the 7s we have today. So beyond that, we continue to take in MAX 8 for a period of time as well. The benefit of having such a decentralized network and kind of really good options around the country is that we can rejigger our network without kind of unwinding it. If you have a big hub and spoke, it\u2019s pretty fragile. You have to operate the hubs and spokes just like the hub is supposed to operate; otherwise you miss connectivity for us. We have a lot of flexibility moving our assets around. So that gives us a much bigger tolerance in some to deal with this. Tammy Romo : Yes. And just one last thought just to emphasize again in our order book that we have with Boeing gives us tremendous flexibility. And there\u2019s a lot of detail in our release today, and we\u2019ve been converting, as you can see there, to -8s along the way here. So we\u2019ve been able to manage through really without any issues so far. David Slotnick : Sure. Thanks. And then just looking at holiday travel coming up, forgive me if you said it before, are you planning just given the extended holiday period for staff incentives or any other kind of staffing plan, just avoiding the issues that some carriers have last year? Mike Van de Ven : Well, David last year, because of the \u2013 where we were in the staffing, we did have incentive plans to try to incent people to come in on their days off. But our staffing level is significantly enhanced this year. And then we spent quite a bit of time making sure that the schedules that we published we\u2019ve got matched to our resources. So we feel well prepared to go into the holiday travel just like we did in the summer. Bob Jordan : Yes, I think we\u2019re in so much better shape. The other thing just to remember, especially Christmas and New Year\u2019s last year, we were dealing with Omicron. So in addition to being a little tighter than we would like on staffing generally, we went in two to three weeks, we suddenly had thousands of employees that were out with Omicron at the tail end of December and early January, which made the staffing, it just really compounded that staffing question. So that\u2019s really what you saw last Christmas and New Year\u2019s. We \u2013 as Mike mentioned, we\u2019ve had focus on \u2013 like always on managing the summer really well and then managing these holiday periods like the 4th of July really, really well because obviously, they\u2019re important to our customers. And our \u2013 Mike, I think our cancel rate was well under 1%. I mean, we had terrific operations during those summer holiday periods, and we will focus on the operation overall. And then, of course, the holiday period is same way this fall. But bottom-line, we are so much better staffed. And again, we \u2013 I know I mentioned this three or four times, we\u2019ve not republished our schedules. And that schedule stability, it just makes our staffing even more efficient because our crews haven\u2019t been moved around just like our customers have moved around if we have to republish the schedule. David Slotnick : Thank you, appreciated. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : And our final question today comes from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Please go ahead with your question. Leslie Josephs : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious on the pilot negotiations and flight attendant and other negotiations as well, how much do you think those contracts are going to add to your costs in 2023 if you do reach a deal soon? Because inflation is much higher than when you started negotiating. And then on the pilot shortage issue in general, are you in favor of any increase in the pilot retirement age or changes to training from the 1,500-hour rule? I know Republicans had some trouble with that. How do you think about that? And do you think there\u2019s a need for any legislative or regulatory changes there? Bob Jordan : Leslie \u2013 Mike, you don't mind, I\u2019ll talk about the rates, and then you talked about the other \u2013 on the rates, as Tammy pointed, we constantly update those. And I\u2019m not going to talk about negotiations here, obviously. We\u2019re in mediation with both our pilots and our flight attendants. And I\u2019m hopeful that helps, and it helps move us to a deal sooner. Because again, I want to get contracts, and we\u2019d love to get them soon with our awesome employees. But we are \u2013 as you look at both inflation and then as you look at deals that are occurring in the industry, we had Alaska just had a pilot deal last week, for example.  As Tammy mentioned, we look at those and then we manage our accruals accordingly. And I would say, you never know until you get there. But I would say, right now, it feels like we\u2019re were adequately accrued for all our groups beginning last April, of course, but I think our approvals look really reasonable to me. Now the markets really move. Who knows? But in terms of what we\u2019ve seen happen so far, our accruals are very reasonable. And Mike, just the changes to the pilot requirements. Mike Van de Ven : No, we\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re interested in the pilot age going up further than what it is, and then the pilot requirements are fine with us the way they are today. We\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re an employer of choice. We have \u2013 I think, really all of our labor contracts, when you look at the scheduling and the quality of life, the compensation, the benefits, the retirements; I think we have best-in-class contracts. We had that coming into the pandemic. I expect we\u2019ll have those going out of the pandemic. And as a result, we\u2019re able to recruit all the people that we need. So we haven\u2019t had a problem recruiting pilots or any other workgroups for that matter. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Jamie. Thanks to the members of the media for joining us today. If you all have any other questions, you can reach out to our RockStar Communications Group at (214) 792-4847 or you can visit us at our media website at www.swamedia.com. Thank you so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, operator and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then leave plenty of room for Q&A. Joining me on the call today is our President and CEO Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson, Executive; Vice President and CFO Tammy Romo, and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green. A quick reminder, that we will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectation of future performance. And our actual results could differ from expectations. Also, we had special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to our press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information.  And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : All right. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, we're disappointed to report a Q4 net loss, as we were on track to produce a healthy fourth quarter profit prior to December 21. We provided an 8-K investor update earlier this month that quantify the preliminary estimate of the financial impacts, so a Q4 loss is likely not a surprise. But I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the operational disruptions.  And first and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and on their holiday plans. We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event, again, like we had last month, and we are highly focused on our customers and our plan going forward. And customer refunds and reimbursements remain a top focus.  While not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs. Well, in terms of the events themselves, we canceled more than 16,700 flights from December the 21 to the December 31. The first few days through December the 23 were specific to the winter storm, and we began to have additional disruptions in the operation on December the 24.  As the largest carrier in roughly half of the top 50 U.S. travel markets, we were impacted by rolling storms to an extraordinary degree. We experienced gridlock and many of our largest airports along with a high frequency of short notice cancellations, which created urgent and repeating efforts to repair the aircraft routings and then our pilot and flight attendant schedules. Given the overwhelming volume of flight cancellations over multiple days, combined with manual workstreams, we determined that the best course of action to get back on track operationally was to reduce our December 27 through December 29 flight activity by roughly two thirds. And that allowed us time to reset the operation to normal flight levels beginning on December the 30.  But based on what we know at this point, our processes and technology generally worked as designed. But we were hit by an overwhelming volume of close in cancellations, which put us behind and creating crew solutions, which in turn pushed us to manual efforts and solutions and Andrew will cover that in detail more here in just a minute.  So we've got several streams of work underway. Immediately following the disruption, we move swiftly to put mitigation efforts in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and to help fortify our operational resilience. We created an early indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals and alert if we approach predefined operational thresholds.  We established supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to support crew recovery efforts at the first sign of a potential workload backlog. We enhanced our existing tools for crew members to communicate electronically to crew scheduling during irregular operations. And we're in the process of swiftly updating and upgrading our crew recovery tools and system to solve the backlog repair of crew member schedules, which was one of the key issues during the disruption. With these short term risk mitigation steps in place or underway, we're taking additional steps to review the events and determine any additional changes to our plans. We worked early on with our Board of Directors and they've established an operations review committee that is working with our management to understand the events and help oversee the company's response.  We've engaged a third-party global aviation firm Oliver Wyman, for a third-party assessment of the event and help make recommendations of additional mitigation elements for us to consider. And that work will conclude here over the next several weeks. And with that assessment and our own, we will reassess our 2023 plans, keeping in mind that we already had a robust operational modernization plan in place for 2023 and Andrew will walk you through that in greater detail as well.  I want to reiterate that Southwest has a very long history of innovation and continuous improvement. We've been investing up to $1 billion per year on technology, both recurring and investment [spend] (ph) included and we have implemented numerous large scale technology and business projects over the past five years, including things like the first implementation of the Amadeus Reservation System in North America, co-developing an innovative network planning system that's now part of the Amadeus product portfolio, ETOPS certification and processes for Hawaii flying, new aircraft maintenance systems, a DDS platform capabilities and connection to three other platforms, a new [pair] (ph) product, and automated ancillary services capabilities, and we're in the process of wrapping up the replacement of our revenue management system, which actually involves three RM systems simultaneously in production, which is an absolute technical feat.  That list is not meant to be comprehensive, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what we've done and what's underway. We're also currently budgeted to spend $1.3 billion of our 2023 annual operating plan on investments, upgrades and maintenance of our IT systems, which is higher than what we spent in 2022. The recent disruptions will likely accelerate some of our plans to enhance our processes and technology, but I suspect that the operational modernization opportunities that Andrew outlined at Investor Day have largely captured the key workstreams and we will dedicate the capital needed to execute in a timely and efficient manner.  We currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans. We were appropriately staffed for our 2022 flight schedules including the holidays and we continue hiring this year to be appropriately staffed for our 2023 flight schedules. Our plans call for adding over 7,000 new employees in 2023, which is actually a decrease of nearly 40% from 2022 hiring levels. We have the order book from Boeing that we need in 2023. And with the short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, we believe we are well prepared to execute our network restoration plans this year. Nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets. And that network restoration should significantly help our operational resilience efforts over the long term. Andrew will also cover that in more detail. Finally, we continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people. And I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to reach agreements with several of our unions recently, including our flight instructors, our facilities maintenance techs, our customer service agents and, just earlier this week, a tentative agreement with our dispatchers. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our ramp and ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants. And we intend, as always, to have competitive market compensation packages for our people. In closing, we still made tremendous progress in 2022. And despite some impact here in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are holding ourselves accountable to the plans that we outlined at our early December Investor Day, and it is still our goal to achieve the long-term financial targets that we outlined. And I know that our people are up to the task. I'm just extremely proud of them for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines, and they remain absolutely our greatest asset, the heart and soul the company and a tremendous source of pride for me personally.  And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will focus the majority of my comments on the operational disruptions to provide some additional color to what Bob shared. We experienced a historic event with a combination of challenges we hadn't experienced before. However, as Bob mentioned, our crew scheduling software didn't stop working during the disruptions, but a combination of our processes and the technology couldn't keep up with the pace of cancellations at the height of the weather disruption. That forced crew scheduling into fully manual mode to develop solutions, and they simply couldn't keep up with the volume of changes. Based on what we know today, it appears that the last domino to fall was when we could no longer use our automation for crew scheduling. Automation works very well for us, but when a problem gets dated, the automation doesn't have the ability to look backward as it tried to solve future problems. To simplify, the decision support tool helps us solve two issues. One, repair the assignments of individual crew members; and two, solve crew coverage problems for individual flights by reassigning crew members and using reserve crew members. If a crew member's individual schedule is not repaired before the next assignment begins, then we aren't able to use the automation to repair the individual schedule. Consequently, without updated crew member schedules, the software can't reassign crew members to solve for flights with crew coverage issues. So the disruption uncovered a functional gap in our technology. However, this issue is in the process of being addressed.  In terms of the moving parts of our point-to-point network, you can think of it in 3 buckets. You have the flight network, the aircraft network and the crew network. We feel very confident in the flight network and schedules we have published for sale, and we are very adequately staffed to operate our fourth quarter flight schedules. We feel very confident in our aircraft network, and we have a sophisticated technology product that we call the Baker that produces new aircraft solutions during irregular operations. At no time during the disruption did the point-to-point journeys of the aircraft present us with an unsolvable problem. For our crew network, the functional gap that was revealed in our crew scheduling software is in the process of being addressed and should be updated in a matter of weeks, which represents quick work by GE Digital and our teams to address the most notable cause of the event that we are currently aware of. So in terms of where we go from here -- this happen again, our access fall into three buckets : immediate mitigation efforts aimed at the last domino to fall; department level assessments and actions; and a systemic review supported by a third-party. Bob covered the immediate mitigation for implemented, our dashboard, supplemental staffing, crew communication tool enhancements, et cetera. He also covered a third-party review of the events and the Board's involvement in working with management to oversee our response. I want to briefly cover the second bucket, which is department actions. Each department has undertaken its own analysis to identify additional measures the departments can make to improve its management of significant disruptions while leaving the cross-departmental improvements to the systemic analysis conducted with a third party.  Some examples of the department efforts include implementing a new crew scheduling phone system targeted for Q1 of 2023, create a network disruption pod and NOC, or network operation control center, to better integrate crew data and to fly cancellation decisions; increased the number of crew schedulers;, evaluate our cold weather preparedness and items such as assessing VIP procedures, protocols and tools to increase throughput; ensuring we have sufficient ground support equipment fuel that is viable in subside temperatures. This list isn't meant to be comprehensive either. Just to share you -- just to share with you that we have already identified some smaller scale opportunities for improvement. And we will have taken actions even before we get to the third-party recommendations. But in terms of the review by Oliver Wyman, we think it is a valuable exercise to understand how the accumulation events led us to the final result. And we still want to see if there are opportunities to improve performance on bad weather days to integrate and to our modernize operation efforts. We recently had an opportunity to test some of the new mitigation efforts implemented recently during the FAA technology outage earlier this month with a Notice to Air Missions or NOTAM system. Our NOC worked around the clock in constant contact with the FAA and the industry to make sure that our NOTAM was restored and valid before we pushed any of our flights. We took the time to ensure verification, safety and compliance, which is why we had not dispatched flight before the FAA ground stop. And it is another example that we will not sacrifice safety. We did not sacrifice safety during the December event, the NOTAM event, and we simply won't going forward. Safety is paramount. And we used our new warning indicators. We deployed additional head count to assist crew scheduling, even though we didn't end up needing them. And we executed target cancellations that help protect how we ended that day to assure a good start the following morning. So while we had a difficult start to that day, thanks to the swift actions taken and enhanced processes in place, we were number one in the industry in on-time performance the next day. Part of the organizational changes when I stepped into the Chief Operating Officer role was to combine network planning with the operations functions in order to further align commercial and operations objectives. And we recently announced a related org change by promoting -- VP network planning, to SVP network planning and network operations control. The goal of this move is to create a tighter feedback loop between scheduled design and schedule execution in order to add resiliency and reliability to our network. This is another action that I believe will help us tremendously. Since the disruptions in late December, our operational performance has been solid. The month of January has seen several ATC outages, historic precipitation in California, where we are the largest carrier, and multiple snowstorms in Denver. Through Monday 23, we are number two in on-time performance out of 10 airlines, trailing American Airlines by less than 1 percentage point. As a reminder of what we shared at Investor Day, I want to recap two areas : our operations focus areas and our capacity plan. First, much of what we are talking about in terms of operational improvement and technology upgrades, I addressed at our December 7 Investor Day. In particular, in the areas of operating quality and frontline staff and tools. In the area of operating quality, I noticed a focused area called network design recovery. While it was not planned as part of our 2023 delivery at that point, we had begun work in that area at the time of Investor Day. We had already selected over Wyman to assist us beginning this January. As part of our reevaluation of our 2023 priorities, we'll accelerate this work. In the area of frontline staffing tools, I noted focus areas of mobility/digital tools and continuous improvement. Again, these were specifically slated to deliver by the end of 2023 but will be evaluated again as part of the reassessment of our plans, given the challenges with crew communications we experienced. I want the third-party review to conclude before I opine on what exactly needs to be done and over what time line, but we have good line of sight to potential improvements in several operations areas that span multiple years, including 2023. Now we need to finalize our plan for 2023 and determine what sequence of improvements are most appropriate in terms of technology and tools investment. And secondly, our 2023 capacity growth is now up to 16% to 17% year-over-year, but this is apples to apples in line with the old 15% that we outlined in Investor Day. Nothing has materially changed in our capacity plans for this year. The increase is simply due to lower capacity in Q4 2022 due to the flight cancellations. We were headed all along toward network restoration, and the December events had nothing to do with staffing levels or our capacity plans. Speaking to 2023 capacity plans, it is nearly all going back in the key Southwest markets and adding market depth. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansions in the pandemic. And as leisure demand remains strong and business demand improves, we have opportunities to build this back up. And this is lower risk capacity growth primarily in markets where we have the number one or number one share in a strong Southwest Airlines customer base.  Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done. And in doing so, it should help fortify the operation with better itineraries, depth and reaccommodation options for customers, crews and aircraft when we do have weather or delays that create regular operations.  So we plan to continue our investment in the network this year. And on the topic of 2023 schedules, last month, we extended our flight schedule for sale from July 11 to August 14. This included the -- in the Southwest points of strength as well as bringing back longer-haul markets, all part of our continued network restoration and accounts for anticipated travel demand for the peak summer travel period.  Denver grew at just over 300 flights a day, the highest ever daily total account for any Southwest Airport, and Baltimore hits approximately 220 days departures, which is higher than summer 2019. We will peak with total daily flights of nearly 4,400 in July 2023. Our next schedule through October 4 will be published on February 9. I want to wrap up by reiterating that we are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating the type of operational event we had last month. And we are also focused on moving forward and running a great operation each and every day. So while there will be lessons learned, we aren't losing focus on the fact -- on the blocking and tackling that is necessary to efficiently operate our network. I'm confident that our people will continue to do just that, and I'm thankful for their focus on running a safe and reliable operation and providing excellent customer service to our customers. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't commend the negotiating teams of TW 557 who represent our flight instructors; and AMFA, who represents our facilities maintenance technicians. These negotiating teams worked tirelessly to reach agreements for their memberships, and I am pleased we can reward these employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality-of-life enhancements. I'm also pleased that we just recently reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, who represents our flight dispatchers, and they will be voting on their TA soon. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups that await a tandem agreement to vote on, and we intend to continue to pay competitive market compensation packages to our employees.  So with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional comment on our 2023 outlook. As a result of the operational disruptions in late December, driving a $620 million negative after-tax net impact, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $226 million, excluding special items. These results are clearly disappointing and not where we expected to be.  Our quarterly performance leading up to December 21 was strong and trending in line with our previous guidance expectation aside from CASM-X, which I will cover in a minute. As Bob mentioned, we still made tremendous progress in 2022 despite the operational setback in late December generating full year 2022 net income of $723 million, excluding special items. Despite the negative revenue impact from the flight cancellations in December, we generated record fourth quarter operating revenues. Brian will speak to our revenue performance and outlook here shortly, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuel, our fuel hedge performed well last year, especially in a volatile market environment. In total, our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit was roughly $950 million with roughly $170 million in fuel expense savings in fourth quarter alone. For 2023, we are 56% hedged in first quarter, 51% hedged in the second quarter and 47% hedged in second half 2023, which equates to 50% hedged for the full year. Based on the January 20 forward curve, we now estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, up $0.25 from our previous guidance and our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, up $0.05 from our previous guidance. Our first quarter guidance includes $0.16 of hedging gains and a hedging premium expense of $0.06 per gallon. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 39% hedged with a fair market value of nearly $561 million in total for 2023 and 2024.  We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 with the goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection. Moving to our non-fuel cost. We experienced a significant cost increase in fourth quarter primarily as a result of the December operational disruptions, including a lower capacity from the flight cancellations. The year over three-year negative impact to fourth quarter CASM, excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, our CASM-X was 23 points. In addition to the impact from lower ASM, the majority of this headwind was driven by the estimated redemption value of rapid reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers. There was also premium pay and additional compensation for employees, but that made up a much smaller portion of the 23-point CASM-X impact.  Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, our fourth quarter CASM-X was roughly 4 points higher than the high end of our previous guidance range of up 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. This was primarily due to additional labor accruals at year-end. As a reminder, we have been accruing for all open labor contracts since April 1, 2022, and these accruals are dynamic as we continuously evaluate market compensation.  Looking forward, we continue to experience year-over-year inflationary cost pressures as well as cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels. We now estimate first quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year, which is approximately 2 points higher than our previous guidance of flat to up 2%. This 2-point increase is due to the continuation of premium pay for a portion of January relating to the December operational disruptions as well as an increase in labor accruals for open contracts. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year compared with previous guidance of down 1% to 3%. The vast majority of the change in guidance is related to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 capacity as well as higher fourth quarter 2022 cost attributable to the December 2022 operational disruption. We have also increased our labor accruals this year, which results in a slight offset year-over-year.  Putting aside the effects of the December operational disruptions, we continue to expect our second half 2023 CASM-X trends to improve from first half 2023 year-over-year. Turning to our fleet. We ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which is net of 26-700 retirements. We received a total of 68 aircraft deliveries from Boeing MAX 8, which was two more than our previous expectation of 66 aircraft. However, we are still short 46 aircraft from the 114 contractually scheduled 2022 MAX deliveries due to Boeing supply chain challenges and the timing of the -7 certification. These 46 orders are reflected as 2023 deliveries in the order book included in our press release this morning. However, we don't expect to be caught up on MAX deliveries by the end of this year. We continue to expect 100 MAX-8s this year, which remains our planning assumption, and we continue to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft which will bring our fleet count to 843 at the end of this year. We have also recently exercised options for delivery in 2024, as outlined in our press release. Our full year 2022 CapEx was $3.9 billion, relatively in line with our previous guidance. In regards to our CapEx plans for this year, we continue to estimate spend to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Bob and Andrew touched on our current thoughts regarding technology spend this year in light of the operational disruption. But I want to reiterate that we are focused on executing our operational modernization plans outlined at Investor Day, which includes our current expectation to spend approximately $1.3 billion this year, including both capital and recurring spend on technology investments, upgrades and system maintenance. And our total CapEx range should allow for additional CapEx investments as needed. Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion after paying a total of $3.1 billion to retire $2.9 million in principal of debt and finance lease obligations during 2022. This includes the $1.2 billion principal prepayment of our 2023 notes, which leaves a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments this year. Our leverage is at a very manageable 47%, which we expect to decline over the next several years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges. While the last several weeks have been tough, we have not lost sight of the priorities and focus areas that we outlined at Investor Day. In addition to the operational modernization plans we already mentioned, we are eager to wrap up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Although it's disappointing, we expect another loss in first quarter this year due to a carryover revenue drag from the operational disruption, we remain steadfast in our focus to generate consistent quarterly profitability. And even with the first quarter headwinds, our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. Furthermore, we remain determined to achieve our long-term financial targets to grow our profits, margins and returns while delivering on our commitment to provide outstanding customer service and reliable operations that have been a source of tremendous pride over our 51-year history.  And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Ryan Green : Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide a bit more detail on fourth quarter trends and our revenue outlook for first quarter. First, as Bob mentioned, we are very focused on taking care of our customers impacted by the operational disruptions last month. We've sent gestures of goodwill. We processed all bags for return to customers. We processed nearly all customer refunds and have completed more than 80% of the reimbursement requests we've received from customers for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. We're processing the remaining requests as quickly as possible and plan to have those largely completed by next week. We will continue working hard every day until all requests are resolved. Turning to our trends. At our Investor Day in early December, we shared that our fourth quarter revenue outlook remains strong. Leisure revenue trends were strong, both in load factors and yields and for both holiday and nonholiday time periods.  Managed business revenues also continue to be strong, and all of that held true right up to the operational disruptions that began on December 21, and we were tracking right in line with our operating revenue guidance to that point. But in the last 10 days of the month, we incurred an estimated $410 million revenue penalty due to the operational disruptions. As the end of December is typically a low demand period for business travel, we experienced less of an impact on business travel trends than with leisure. We still came in at the better end of our managed business revenues fourth quarter guidance range at down 20% compared with fourth quarter of 2019. And despite the $410 million impact, we still generated record fourth quarter revenues of $6.2 billion and a record passenger yield of $0.177. We saw other positive contributors in the fourth quarter from our loyalty program with fourth quarter records and new co-brand card acquisitions and retail sales. In addition, we benefited from the continuation of increased take rates for upgraded boarding, and our portfolio of new cities and development markets also performed in line with expectations in fourth quarter, absent the event. So in all, there was plenty to be encouraged by in terms of underlying trends in the fourth quarter. We continue to feel good about our 2023 revenue plan. Admittedly, we are starting off first quarter with a $300 million to $350 million headwind, which we assume is attributable to the operational disruptions in December. However, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, and we believe the vast majority of the first quarter impact is isolated to January and February travel. For March 2023, leisure booking and yield trends appear strong and in line with what we would expect from a high-demand travel month. And based on recent improvements in close-end booking trends, we expect March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Beyond that, we expect that our GDS and Southwest business initiatives will provide the opportunity to grow managed business revenues sequentially beyond March. So we are optimistic about both the improving sequential trends we're seeing as well as the early read on March bookings. And based on these trends, we currently expect first quarter operating revenues to increase in the range of 20% to 24% year-over-year. And then finally, while we have limited visibility further out on the booking curve, we continue to see no noticeable signs of a slowdown in macro travel demand and our booking trends. Our commercial focus areas and initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day remain unchanged. We continue to focus on driving value from network restoration, new market maturation, Southwest business and GDS, our new fare product, revenue management system modernization and in-flight customer experience enhancement. In closing, I want to acknowledge that we are mindful that we have a few new headwinds in 2023, both on the revenue and the cost side. And as a result, we will continue to work even harder on our revenue plans and revenue generation this year. Ultimately, we need to offset higher costs, and revenue is part of that equation. We still believe there is strong demand ahead of us, and we're encouraged by the revenue trends we currently see in March.  So with that, I turn it back over to Ryan Martinez. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, sir. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder, to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up if needed. And operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Bob, thanks to you and the team for all the detail. Again, there was a lot of detail there, but if you were to just take a step back and look at the bigger picture here, there have been a few operating issues for, I'd say, the last 18 months or so. Is this just a series of unfortunate events given unprecedented circumstances? Or do you take a step back and say, hey, we have not invested in kind of tech and systems and things that we should have. Now we're catching up and kind of going forward? I think in that kind of realization understanding sort of determines your response and maybe also kind of if the regulators are focusing on this kind of how they will react to it. Bob Jordan : Ravi, yeah, thank you so much. I think I'd separate into three pieces. Number one, we invest a lot in technology. We've invested roughly $1 billion a year, and that will be even higher here in 2023. And so there's been no lack of investment. You've seen us implement things recently like an industry-leading aircraft routing and maintenance system. Just this year, we put in an entire new people and human capital management system and ongoing. Technology is always a journey. And so there are always things to work on.  And again, as we've gotten larger and more complex, there are continued investments in things like bag tracking and software that's used in the stations and transfer -- bag transfer driver applications. And I could go on and on and on. So that's why you heard us at Investor Day and prior lay out one of our foundational strategies was modernize the operation, again, not because of -- we're radically behind but because we need to invest in the operation just as we continue to grow and continue to remain efficient. I think if you take this event, this event was different. We saw just a historic level of weather activity across the country that hit many cities, continued for days. Again, I'm not going to -- I don't want to blame just this on weather because it continued well after that. That caused an historic level of cancellations that turned into an historic level of aircraft reroutings that led to an historic level of crew reroutings or rescheduling. That ultimately was something we've never seen at that level, and it just overwhelmed the technology and the processes. And the technology, by the way, in crew scheduling, there's been some, I think, bad information. It worked as designed. We just never had seen this level of activity. And so ultimately, all of that coming at crew scheduling put us to the point where, rather than solving future problems, in other words, new routings for crew was solving past problems. And that's what the software was really not designed to do because we had never seen that before. It's never been a requirement. I'm glad to say that our folks, technology working with GE Digital have very quickly identified an enhancement and upgrade to deal with that. And that upgrade to the Sky solver is actually complete and in test right now, so they move very quickly. So I don't know that -- I think this event was very different, but I would acknowledge that there are things that we need to work on as we continue to grow the operation and become even more efficient and use technology. And Andrew, if you want to -- anything you want to add there? Andrew Watterson : No, I think this functional gap was also -- other airlines use the software, and they had not asked for that gap to [be covered] (ph) there. So it was new for us. It's new for this tool at GE Digital has sold to not just us. And so it's not a common practice. It gets so far behind on issues resolved. In this situation, it did. We have a lot of medium-sized cities that are in the swathe of the weather. And we saw, as we got increased stress in the operation because of the cold weather, it led to incremental cancellations we talked about.  We precanceled, as we always do, in large weather events. But then the larger that impacted -- larger-than-expected distress in the operation from the weather led us to more cancellations closer in, and that's what gave us a problem, which manifested in this kind of past issue that the solver could not take care of. Bob Jordan : And Ravi, the only other thing not to go on but I'll add is just the -- this was a significant event. We disrupted thousands and thousands of customers at a critical point in time and really made a mess here for our employees and our customers. And I can't apologize enough for that. And I own that, and we will do everything it takes to ensure that we don't have an event like that again, which is why we're doing short-term things that Andrew talked about. We've got this assessment coming here in weeks from Oliver Wyman and we will take the learnings there and implement those. So you -- but just at the end of the day, that kind of disruption cannot happen again. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That is very clear. Thank you for additional color. Maybe as a quick follow-up. I think you said that the 2023 revenue impact seems to be isolated to Jan and Feb. What was the driver of that? Is that just kind of recovering the schedule to normal? Or did you see a buyer strike? And do you have any indication that, from a reputational standpoint -- because, obviously, we know that Southwest is one of the most beloved like airline brand in the country. Kind of are you seeing any eroding of that in customer confidence? Thank you. Bob Jordan : Yeah, I'll have -- yes, sir. I'll have Ryan jump in here, too. But I think we had -- you had a couple of things. You had, obviously, the return portion of trips that were affected during the holiday period that were then canceled that led into January, you have -- it's a low period of the year to start with. And so bookings and travel are generally low. I think you had a period of time there where we weren't -- just weren't taking as many bookings as we would typically. I'm sure you had some book away. The good thing is our customers are very loyal, and it's -- we're seeing that. Our March and forward booking trends in leisure look really strong. They look normal. They look in line with the plan that we presented at Investor Day. Our managed business looks like it will roughly currently \u2013 at current trends will be roughly in line with 2019 and restored to 2019. We had a sale recently. That sale went really well. We gave our customers affected over 2 million basically codes or 25,000 rewards points, and we're seeing our customers redeem those quickly at an even faster than typical rate for something like that, this gesture of goodwill. So while we disrupted our customers, and I'm very sorry for that, we are seeing our customers be loyal to Southwest Airlines, and we're seeing kind of normal trends March and beyond. Ryan? Ryan Green : Yeah. I'll just give some additional color here. The first quarter is a tale of two halves. In the first quarter -- the first half of the quarter is very low demand time period, and that was impacted by the cancellations like Bob mentioned. And then it's just very tough with the hangover from the operational event kind of the first couple of weeks in January to get real traction.  We did not want -- if you go out and look at the fares that we have published for this time period, there are regular kind of routine promotional fares. We didn't think it would help to be overly promotional in this time period. But then when you get into the second half of the quarter and President's Day and beyond and kind of into March, as Bob mentioned, both loads and yields look like we were on plan. March right now is roughly 40% booked. So that's enough to give us a good read on the month. And if you just kind of take the load and yields where they sit today and project that out forward and kind of what we would expect from here and what that implies for March overall, I think we're going to be very pleased with the performance in the month of March. So we're not seeing any sort of elevated cancellation rates for March. As Bob mentioned, March performed very well, responded very well to the sale. And so it just feels like it's -- we're kind of back on plan here in March. And then if you look at managed business travels, it's very early in the managed business travel booking curve, but those -- what we can see, those also look encouraging. So yeah, so the second half of the quarter, I think we're going to hopefully get back to the momentum we were seeing in the fourth quarter before the event. And we'll continue to monitor customer sentiment as we go forward here. But yeah, the customers expect us to do the right thing here, but largely, they're loyal and sticking with us. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. So I know you guys don't have revenue or RASM guidance for the year. But it seems like the industry is sort of moving at this flattish RASM metric for the year. Would you expect to [Indiscernible] with the industry? Or as you sort of rebuild credibility, customer loyalty, whatever however you want to call it, do you approach pricing any differently than maybe the overall market this year? Ryan Green : It was a little hard to hear. It was a little hard to hear there, but I think that the question was really relative to the industry and performance do we expect to price any differently. I think we're not going to comment on forward pricing here beyond what's kind of out there on the shelf and what you all can see. But what I will say is that the go-to-market and promotional plan that we have executed thus far and thus far in this year is the exact same go-to-market and promotional plan that we had relative to before the event.  So we're approaching things kind of per normal here. And I would expect, as we kind of get back on the plan in March and beyond, I expect that it will be just a normal year here in terms of how we manage things going forward. Yields -- loads and yields have been very strong. Going back to the post-Omicron environment last year, we had record yields in the fourth quarter even despite the event, and those yields would have been higher without the event. So we're -- it's a strong fare environment now, and I expect that to continue. Bob Jordan : And you obviously have the -- one of our strategic initiatives is the new Chase agreement, and we're seeing strong Rapid Rewards redemptions here right now as well, which is helping. Scott Group : Okay. And then hopefully, this sounds better. But I understand you don't think you need to cut capacity. But as you talk about kind of reduced risk, why not be a little bit maybe more prudent and cut some capacity and get through a period of better operations where you really ramp up the capacity? Bob Jordan : Yeah, Scott, I think the -- I mean, you would do that if you felt like there was a reason that it helps. So we actually feel the opposite. Number one, the event in December really had nothing to do with staffing. We were fully staffed. In fact, we hit our -- we beat our hiring goals in 2022. A lot of that is set up for our 2023 capacity. We're having no trouble hiring, including having no trouble hiring pilots. Almost all of the capacity in 2023 is going into restoring the network. It's going into existing city pairs, adding depth and breadth, and all that is not just good for our customers. It's good for the operation and operational reliability. So we actually feel the reverse, which is the restoration of capacity will be helpful in terms of operational reliability, not hurtful. So then the only other reason would be because you don't believe you can execute your hiring plans, which we are having no issue executing our hiring plans. We're actually a little ahead here in terms of staffing up for 2023. Andrew, do you want to add anything? Andrew Watterson : I'd also say if you -- if one was worried about, can you operate this level of capacity, you would expect that to show up in your operating performance. And I mentioned that we were number two through Monday. I just got sitting here the updated numbers through yesterday, and we're number one in the industry in OTP for the month of January. For the month of December, we were number five out of 10 airlines even with the disruption, and we're number four going into the disruption, and we were number three during Thanksgiving, number three to the month of November. So it's obvious that we're able to operate the capacity that we have out there. It's not sitting out -- the fact we're above average in the industry with regard to that. So not showing that as a root cause. We're hesitant to make adjustments given that we think it could also be helpful as we go forward. But once again, we're going to get down to the root causes. And then when they show up, we will take actions based on the root causes. There's lots of solutions that people want to throw out there to us. But when you kind of take action on a potential solution and you don't understand if it addresses the problem, all you're doing is wasting resources and not necessarily addressing the problem. So we want to bottom out the problem even though it takes a little bit longer than people would like and then address those problems so it doesn't happen again. Scott Group : That make sense. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Andrew Watterson : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. So Andrew, maybe if I can follow up there. I mean, if I listen to this call, it sounds like you guys were properly staffed. The technology really wasn't the problem apart from this GE Digital issue. And you guys are talking about the network not being the issue. Cost guidance, CapEx guidance, all that really hasn't changed this year. So the outlook just kind of missed a beat but keeps going on. The problem is you guys did cancel a lot more flights than your competitors. And if I look at your completion factor this month, I think you will be trailing your competitors. Just look at yesterday, I think about a 6% cancel rate.  So I guess what confidence can you give investors and your customers and your other stakeholders here that this was really just a one-off thing and not something that is more structural within the company? Andrew Watterson : Yeah. I wouldn't call it a GE Digital issue. That software, that solver they sell to us and others performs well in normal times. This is a use case that nobody defined for them. So -- in their defense, the software worked fine. Now we did get to a bad spot there.  With regards to our cancellation percentages, yesterday was 6%, there was snow in Midway. So Midway has specific operational restrictions. It's very tight quarters. And so when you have de-icing and winds coming from the wrong direction, it's prudent to be a little more cautious, and we cancel a little bit more because it was a low time of season, as Ryan talked about, a low time of year. So we could reaccommodate all those customers that were canceled out of Midway on the subsequent flights because we canceled them the day before. So we ended up beating our competitors by 20 points of OTP yesterday. They canceled less, but they delayed then hundreds of thousands of customers by canceling fewer. We made hundreds of thousands of customers on time, and a handful that had their flight cancel that were accommodated. So overall, we believe we gave a superior customer service yesterday. The day before that, that same-store system generated severe thunderstorms in Houston, including tornadoes near Houston Holiday that even put the ATC tower down for a while. We had zero percent cancels in Houston for that and -- for that day because we have the infrastructure there to handle it. Up North, the carrier that operates out of Intercontinental canceled 20% of their flights in that day to handle it. So in that situation, a very flattering compare. But once again, I imagine they would say they have infrastructure issues. They're different than Hobby. So a lot of times, those percentages look deceiving if it's about a specific airport in particular. And so you have to look at the environment that's caused you to cancel, you have to be safe and understand how you commit your customers. Net-net, it resulted in a very flat and on-time performance for us yesterday and pushed us over the edge to be number one for the industry. So I think that's a quality product. The customers love it. NPS score is good for that kind of stuff. And so I think that's what our customers want to see. Bob Jordan : Yeah. And if you take the data in January is very way down the weeds here, but it's very polluted by the January 11 NOTAM issue, where there were all kinds of issues as well. for most of -- prior to the day you're talking about here, most of the day, I think the 15 days or so prior to that, we were 99 -- in the 99-plus a couple of several days in the 99.9% completion factor range, several days canceling one flight. So you just have to watch the aggregate because if you have an anomaly in a day that's very different, like the day Andrew described or the NOTAM day, it will throw that -- it will throw it off. Obviously, you know that. Andrew Watterson : I'd say in the NOTAM day, as I mentioned in my remarks, we didn't push before the ground stop. So basically, that means we got a much later start because we were being safe, and we wanted the FAA to tell us that, that was validated before we pushed because of how we read the regulations. Therefore, we ended up with more cancellations that day, a significant number more than some of our competitors there. And so that inflates the numbers for January overall. But once again, it was safe and we ended up being set up nicely for the next day.  And then lastly, when you look at our competitors, don't forget, they outsource 40% to 50% of the departures to some low wage regionals on behalf. Customer doesn't realize that. So when they give you a number that says, cancel this many, make sure you're including all the branded operations, not just their ma inline. Brandon Oglenski : And for sure, we do look at seats and flights impacted. But I guess coming off this call, where is the urgency to ensure that specific to you guys this doesn't happen again? I mean, does it come in the form of more urgency on the pilot contract? Do you need to look at more non-aircraft CapEx? I mean just help investors get their arms around it, please. Bob Jordan : I think the urgency is across the board. There's nothing -- everything is on the table. And as Andrew pointed out, we went through in these remarks, we have things that we're doing right now, early warning dashboards, staffing up, crew scheduling, we're looking at de-icing procedures top to bottom.  We're buying more in covers for extremely cold weather. We're looking at fuel mixes for ground equipment when you have sub-zero temperatures on and on and on. We're also waiting patiently here. And it will be weeks, not months, to get the Oliver Wyman report to understand root causes and what we need to do there. But we will do everything that it takes whether that is buying engine covers, technology changes, whatever that list may be to ensure that this kind of event doesn't happen again.  I disconnect contracts because the -- we've had -- we've made great progress. We've got -- we've gotten 5 agreements here in the last couple of months with our unions. I'm very, very proud of that -- and our negotiators, and I'm very proud of our union partners. We have a couple more to go. We're making, I think, really good progress. We have two of those that are in mediation. Pilot applied attendance. That mediation process is a defined process controlled by the mediator. The mediator controls the schedule, the meeting times, the meeting dates, but we're making progress in both of those as well. We're eager to finish those up. Our employees are terrific. We're going to -- we've always paid well and we're going to pay well. We're going to have market competitive compensation. You know that. We know that, and our employees know that. So I am eager to wrap those up, but mediation is a process. Andrew Watterson : I'd say we know what happened to the last on the fall as I call it. We've put in place with urgency. And that was the urgency we had, make sure the same thing doesn't repeat itself. So we have the safeguards for that same thing not to repeat itself, but we think there could be common root causes. That's why when we take the time between the weather starting and us getting to that kind of position with our crew scheduling software. Lots of decisions were made, lots of coordination between ground operations, our control center, our crew scheduling. Lots of equipment that was used to handle cold weather. Something in there in that sequence of events led us to the spot where we were at the end. And so immediately protect that situation to not happen again and then follow the string upstream to find the series of actions that led us to there and resolve those. And so that's what we're taking the time to do. It's a couple of weeks. I think it's worthwhile to take a few weeks since we have the kind of emergency stuff done to find those root causes that you can address, and that may require incremental spending or maybe incremental management effort, and we shall see. But we certainly have intention and plans to have that start up right away after that report is done. Bob Jordan : And then I know we're going on and on. It's just so important. The last thing I would add is that we -- while this event was something significant and something we are absolutely not proud of, we've got a 51-year history of operating really, really well. We were operating really well prior to this event. We had good performance in '22 leading up to December 21, good performance at the holidays, Thanksgiving, Labor Day, et cetera. So never forget that we are -- we haven't always -- always will be a terrific operator. The main point here is we will attack this head on whatever we need to work on here. Especially once we understand the OW report, we will attack it with a sense of urgency. We will boost our spending, if that's technology if we need to, but we will do everything to double down to make sure that this does not happen again. It's critical. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Good afternoon. Is interlining off the table? Andrew Watterson : I don't think interlining changes. If we had interlining there, then there may be some subset of customers that we could have reaccommodated. But other airlines were full this time of year as well. So we would have still had the same event. We still would have in this discussion even if we had interlining.  Now domestic interlining has prohibited the scope agreement with our pilots. So we have to get scope relief to do that. But should they accommodate us there and we put an interline, that made the margin help with some level of disruption, but you would still have the large, large majority of people would not have been accommodated through a direct interline. Jamie Baker : And second, Tammy, thanks for including the fact that you've updated your labor cost accruals. Just to clarify, the industry convention seems to be to exclude any planned retro pay or signing bonus. I assume that's also true for Southwest. Tammy Romo : Jamie, we're doing our best to include the total cost to get these labor agreements over the finish line here. So as we shared back in December, the environment is dynamic, and we're continuously evaluating that. But our estimates include the total cost, I guess, is a better way to say that, to wrap up our contracts as well as recently, of course, ratify contracts. Jamie Baker : Got it. I'm sure you're looking forward to locking down the contracts. So I'll stop hounding you about it. I appreciate it. Thank you, everybody. That's it for me. Tammy Romo : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : And our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thank you. I wanted to ask you about work rules. And if they are modernized and aligned with operational recovery. There's been so much written about technology gaps fairly or unfairly. The media is really run with those talking points. I'm not sure if you're willing to go there, but for example, do your pilots need to call into a call center to verbally confirm reassignment? It seems like the numbers that would have been required in this event would overwhelm any call center, and it feels like maybe there could be an app for that. Any thoughts on that would be great. Bob Jordan : Duane, this is Bob. I'll just start and then Andrew has got a lot more detail than I do, but I think I'd break it into two pieces. We have electronic notification in place for our crews. And there's more work to do there in terms of there's all kinds of things that you use electronic notification for. But that's -- yes, there's been some report that that's out in place. It's absolutely in place. What we need to work on is the -- and it's a contractual change electronic acknowledgment. So that's which I believe Andrew does not require -- in other words, to know that, that has been acknowledged, for example, accepting a crew reroute. That's a contractual change to do that. Obviously, to -- for the operation, you have to know not simply that it was delivered electronically, but it was acknowledged and it's going to happen. So there is work to do. There is some work to do on the electronic notification, but we do have that capability. But there's also, I think, even more work to do on the contractual piece of this, which is the acknowledgment. And obviously, those two contracts are open, and that's a piece of what our negotiators and teams are working on. But Andrew, if you want to add. Andrew Watterson : Yeah. I think crew communication was a problem during the event, not the problem. So we definitely want to improve that. We have some means, consistent with the current contracts, to have some level of electronic communication with our flight crews. Both have learned from this. I think we will incorporate that in our negotiations. I think we will wait until we finish the negotiations before we kind of design the next generation of electronic communication tool with our crews because it must respect the contractual agreement. So I think this event will get us all aligned on the need for improving that. And once we get that ironed out in the open contracts, then we'll go and develop the next generation of that electronic communication. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then just on my follow-up, I'll stick with you, Andrew. Can you comment on what percent of your network is out and back flying? And I know it's too early to prescribe the medicine here. But any thoughts on your ability to increase out and back or if that might be a potential solution? Andrew Watterson : I can't recall off the top of my head. I don't want to give you a number for fear of being wrong. We have, in the past -- this comes up a lot. We've put into our schedules in like test areas of the region out and back. So we did this in Midway, I think, three years ago or four years ago. And so we put this around the system to see if that improves anything by increasing out and back to certain percentages, and we haven't found that to be the case. We found other things we can put into our schedule to help with on-time performance. And part of the move actually with the moving network planning and our control center under one roof is because it is difficult to nail down how to incorporate recoverability into your schedule, even though everyone seems to have an opinion. We know we can incorporate crew needs overall. We've gotten very good at that, maintenance needs, ground-up needs. We can model to a good level of detail the predicted on-time performance for a schedule. But how does one define what's a recoverable schedule is actually more difficult to contact design than you might imagine. So bringing the two groups together, we can create a tighter feedback loop through smaller continuous improvement efforts to test and learn smaller iterations of recoverability built into the network is the design -- the desire behind this idea of moving them under one organization, and they've already started that. We'll see cross-pollination of people who work on our control center now working in our network planning to help design schedules, people who design schedules, doing a tour in the control center to learn what's like to operate it. And so we think that tighter linkage should help us incrementally improve recoverability into the schedules. But we're definitely -- all years about doing that but they kind of out and back is something that gets thrown around. And really, we haven't seen how that can have a direct cause and effect improvement. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate the thoughts. Andrew Watterson : Thanks, sir. Operator : And the next question will come from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning or good afternoon. Just on the hiring, you talked about staffing was not the issue. I was kind of curious if you could provide a little bit more color on the hiring plans this year and the cadence. Because if you look at your capacity growth, there's a lot more capacity growth in the second half. And I think that's something that kind of causes some concern given just a lot of growth coming in and given having to address some of these operational issues. So could you talk a little bit about the hiring cadence here? Bob Jordan : Savi, it's Bob. Absolutely. And then, Andrew, if you want to chime in, just in terms of where. But the -- yes, there's obviously timing to hire and their timing to train and become proficient, especially in certain areas like the ramp. And so it's a piece of why we actually came in above our targeted hiring for '22 is to get ahead of that for '23. So some of that will be front loaded a bit in '23 as we prepare for capacity in the back half. Our hiring in '23, the plans right now, I think we hired just over 11,000 in '22 net. It's roughly 7,000 net in '23. So it actually falls roughly 40%, again, because there's a piece of the '22 hiring that was a setup for '23. And again, we don't -- there's no evidence that we were not staffed for the holidays or that we're not currently staffed. We are well staffed. The one exception in terms of the change from year-over-year pilots, we hired net roughly, I think, just under 1,000 pilots in '22. The plan is to hire net roughly 1,700, I think, in '23. So that actually is increasing. Our classes, we'll watch them every single day. We're just down meeting with potential new hires earlier this week. We're having no trouble attracting terrific pilots to Southwest Airlines, no trouble filling classes. There's been some discussion of attrition, are you seeing higher attrition in our pilot area. Our attrition last year, I think, in our flight ops group was under 1%. We've got a lot more new hires, which you would expect it to be a little bit elevated there. But it's, again, under 1% and roughly normal. So we're not seeing any issue attracting pilots to Southwest Airlines. But Andrew, I don't know if you want to talk any more detail about just where. Andrew Watterson : So in aggregate, we'll have less hiring this year than last year. And that's true for every work group except for pilots. And so as we've mentioned before, we are pilot constrained in our flying. We're not flying all of the aircraft where we could. We're producing all the ASMs we could right now because of the number of pilots not the productivity of pilots.  And so as we run our training plan here this year, by the end of next -- excuse me, the back half of this year, we've told you before that we will no longer be pilot-constrained. And that's when we'll start using our full fleet, which is why you see the kind of pop-up in capacity there in the back half of the year. The groups we've kind of pre-hired, they don't have as long as the training footprint as pilots do. So therefore, the proficiency they get is on the job, so to speak, for some of them. And that's why you see if you ever look out the window and airport and see a different color vests. Those are people who are still in training but OJT trainings, those who are fully proficient. And so you want them to be out in the network now taking some repetitions, if you will, so that when the capacity comes later in the year, they've had more experience. So that's why you'll see the numbers coming down as capacity goes up later in the year. Savi Syth : That's super helpful. And if I may, just on the -- it sounded like from a CapEx standpoint, if you needed to kind of increase in spend on some systems to kind of expedite some of the changes, it would fall within that CapEx. But I was kind of curious from a resource standpoint, do you have that ability to kind of -- would you kind of pivot? Or would you be able to kind of increase the amount of tech activity that you do this year? Bob Jordan : Yeah. We have -- for your first question, yes, I think that's captured in the ranges that we provided, number one. And two, the technology spend in total was already increasing from 2022 -- and then three, your technology support is always a mix of employees and contractors and third parties that we use in terms of development. So yeah, we have the ability to flex as needed. Andrew Watterson : It may not just be IT. It could be equipment. So we're not prejudging all the extra spend would be IT. It could be the case that we need new or different de-icing trucks or some other infrastructure at the airport. So there is non-tech work that is likely to come out of this. It's not just tech. There was some tech shortcomings that we've addressed, and there could be more tech we do to get ourselves even better. But I think -- there will also be some other equipment and other kind of operating changes we make that don't fall in the technology realm. Bob Jordan : And again, I think the range is wide. I think all of that would be captured in the CapEx range that we provided. Savi Syth : Helpful, guys. Thank you Bob Jordan : Thanks, Savi. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question, and we will take our last question from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just on the book way estimate that you gave for the first quarter. Curious if you could parse out just how the corporate side of that's doing. When I think about you selling your network and what Southwest does great domestically, the operations are obviously going to be a big debate there. So just curious on how that commentary has gone so far or that conversation has gone so far. Ryan Green : Yeah, Conor, it's Ryan. Of course, immediately following the events, in the days following the event, we were out there talking to kind of general consumers but also talking to corporate travel managers to make sure we had a really good handle on sentiment and what they were needing to hear from us. And so -- and those conversations have continued. We're getting direct feedback from them as well. And from a corporate travel standpoint, as you would expect, they outlined the need for us to be open and transparent about our mitigation plans, what we're doing to ensure that this doesn't happen again, making sure that we have plans in place to take care of customers and that we keep them regularly updated. And of course, we're doing all of those things. We're out in the field talking to them all of the time to making sure that they understand what we're doing. When we ask them about their plans for 2023, the vast majority of those corporate travel managers say that they do not plan to reduce the level of flying on Southwest this year, which I think is a positive sign there. And then when you just look at the bookings from the managed business side as they've come in here in the first quarter, for sure, there was an impact in January. It was -- those first couple of weeks of the year. Those are big booking months. The hangover was real given the proximity to the event. So there was definitely a hangover or there was an impact in January and some into the first part of February as well. But when I look at February bookings and kind of where we're -- what we're trending towards here, and we're kind of getting into the meat of the booking curve for managed business travel. So we've got a good look at it. February is much better than January. In fact, I think February is sequentially better. It will likely turn out that February is going to be sequentially better than where we ended in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, as we get to March, we're expecting that we're roughly back to pre-pandemic levels on the managed business side.  So we've got -- we're certainly focused on that market. That's a big part of our plans for the year, and we'll keep after it. But as we get further into the quarter here, I'm encouraged by how resilient they've been. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on the -- you talked about the crew network issue in your prepared remarks and that you're rolling out a new system in the next couple of weeks. Just curious on how much collaboration you have with your pilots and maybe your other in-flight crew members when looking for a fix there. Did they have an influence at all? Or were you not allowed to talk? Like can you just maybe talk a little bit about the overall culture there with them talking about the fixes? Thank you. Ryan Green : Well, I think I'm not quite sure if I'm getting your question but I don't please redirect me. So the system is what we call Sky Solvers. It's called something else by the manufacturer. It had a functional gap I talked about. We are putting in a fix to that. We call it -- upgrade. You will now have the functionality to be able to solve the past crew member problem such that they don't hamper us in the future. Now this is not something that we -- our crew members would be -- in their unions would be happy that we fixed this problem because they didn't like the result of having to fix in there. And so I think from that perspective, they would like -- they want to get the job done, so to speak. As far as the culture, we're in mediation. We're in negotiations in the final stages. And so that's always noisy, if you will. They would like certain changes, and where it's coming down to is a lot of the changes they're asking for on the scheduling side, and this was a scheduling issue. And so it kind of dovetailed nicely for them to be able to kind of give input on it. And I think those things we can improve upon, and we're happy to take those suggestions. And we actually have a big confab with them coming up here in a couple of weeks where they're going to come in and get our subject matter experts together and talk about how we can improve on the scheduling front. And I even sat down at one of the other unions yesterday, the day before, for the same reason. So we welcome their input. We want to establish a good professional relationship for them of how we can jointly improve. And so maybe this is a silver lining as we can start down that path. Bob Jordan : And I just -- just add that. Yes, you've seen a lot of the news that there are things that our unions have said that we have asked for, for years quote unquote and things like to work on notification. And we agree, there's work to do on notification. I just want as you know, we agree with them, and that work is going on in negotiations here. And I'm optimistic that we'll get there. Second, we've got this all of our Wyman report that will wrap up here quickly, and it's a comprehensive review, and it's a wide-ranging collaborative review with a lot of parties, parties that were involved, including the frontline in Denver, for example, and the NOC and leaders that were involved. But we're also including our union leadership in that work to gather their feedback as well because they're valued partners, and we want to listen and understand. And then as Andrew said, you've got things that are more wrapped up in negotiation like scheduling rules that I don't know that I attached to the event and the operational disruption. That's a normal part of negotiations, just like compensation. But -- and we'll be moving through that as we continue to move through mediation. But no, we value our union partners, and we're listening to them certainly in terms of their viewpoints of what happened in our December issues. Ryan Green : We've already said for this, once a report comes out and now identify areas we need to improve upon, we will work with them to jointly develop solutions in the applicable areas for them. So I think we're committed to them be part of the solution as we look to take advantage of the lessons learned reported. Conor Cunningham : Appreciated, thank you. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and hope you all have a great day Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad, and welcome to the members of the media on today's call. We can go ahead and get started for the Q&A portion. Chad, if you'll get them queued up for us. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be from Dawn Gilbertson from the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning --afternoon everybody. I have two questions. The first one is for Bob or Andrew or both, and the second one is for Ryan. The first one is you guys seem to be sending some mixed messages here. You clearly state the staffing sign issue. Andrew just said crew communication was a problem, but not the problem.  And then you mentioned this functional gap and said other airlines didn't -- also didn't have this gap addressed. But isn't it because the scope of your issues here were so large, that's why it exposed this system? So I guess what I'm asking here is how much of the -- without waiting for the Oliver Wyman report how much of this was bad decision-making on Southwest Airlines? Or what was the problem, please? Andrew Watterson : Well, the reason we do the work is to find the problem. I know we'd like to know it now and not later, but that's the point of it, respectfully. But we know that the -- when this kind of functional gap showed up was because you had a lot of close-in cancels. As I mentioned earlier, we frequently -- if we're seeing a storm come in, you do cancels in advance. So I cancel today for tomorrow, just like we did, yes, recently with Midway. And so that we had done for the storm. Then we got ourselves in a position where we're making lots of cancels close in. And as Bob mentioned, from the 23rd, which was still a weather event and towards the 24th or a transition to a crew event, sometime in that time frame, this level of closing cancels led us to get behind and then we lost the use of the automation. And when we lose use of the automation, there's just not enough hours in the day for the crew schedules to catch up manually. They almost did a couple of times, but we know, ultimately, we didn't. And so then the question becomes, well, what were the sequence of events that led to that point. We've had a lot of these close-in cancels. That is what we're trying to get to the bottom of so we can address that. And so we don't know that right now. So that's why we don't give you a very clear answer on that specific thing, even though we understand where ultimately that led to. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. That's helpful. So you're saying that you guys had, obviously, a lot more last-minute cancellations than others since they recovered much more quickly even though you don't know why that was at this point? Is that correct? Andrew Watterson : I'm not necessarily saying versus others. I mean for ourselves, we have a lot of close-in cancels, and that's what led to our problem is what we believe at this point in time. I've not done a comparative that I have in front of me that I can tell you that -- what the others did at the same time, that will also be part of the work that we'll look at as well. But as far as what I can see right now, what I'm suspecting at this point in time is that was the sequence. But once again, you need to kind of dig into it with both interviewing people to understand who did what when, so to speak, with the interviews and then also with the data to corroborate that, that was actually what happened. So it's -- I wouldn't call it tedious, but it's detailed work to fit that picture all together and come out with a time line that shows with good fidelity and backed up with data of what happened and what that led to. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. Thanks very much. The second question is for Ryan or somebody or maybe Tammy. Can you guys attach them -- I know you've given the total dollar figure, but can you attach some dollar figures to the dollar figure of refunds, the dollar number? I know you're only 80% through on reimbursement. And also on reimbursement, I'm curious, did you guys, because of the scale and scope of this and the damage to your reputation, did you broaden the definition of reasonable as you're going through all these expenses? Thanks very much. Bob Jordan : Yeah, I'll take the first part and then let Tammy take the financials. Throughout the event, right away, we promised -- we knew it was the right thing to do that we had significantly impacted holiday travel plans here. We knew it was the right thing to do to offer refunds and then to offer reasonable -- to reimburse for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. And the direction that we gave the teams were to be generous in that regard and lean towards the customer. And so I think a lot of these decisions are subjective, but I think the team did a really good job of balancing, understanding what is reasonable and leaning towards the customer in order to do the right thing by them.  So I think it was -- admittedly, it's a subjective element that you've got to kind of find where the line is there, but I think our teams leaned into the customer and largely did the right thing there. Tammy? Tammy Romo : Yeah. And on the financial impact, as we shared in the release, the total cost impact was $390 million for the fourth quarter. And the lion's share of that was the customer reimbursements and the Rapid Reward points that we offer to our -- and that we expect to be redeemed. So there was a much smaller portion that related to premium pay that we paid to our employees.  So the lion's share of that was the customer reimbursements in Rapid Reward points. We haven't given the specific dollar amount of that, but it was probably roughly 50-50 between those two categories. Bob Jordan : And Dawn, I'll just add one more thing here. The -- and those customers that were most severely impacted that we issued the gesture of goodwill for, we issued those Rapid Reward points roughly three weeks ago. And when we look at those customers today, 25% of them already have future travel booked on Southwest Airlines. So -- and in 3 weeks, that's really pretty good. So I think that it is a -- I take that as a sign of confidence that customers understand. They understand that we messed up there. We did everything that we could to make it right and that fourth of them already have future travel booked on Southwest. Ryan Green : And Dawn -- not necessarily with those points, some of them with those points and some of them being cash, just future travel. Bob Jordan : Dawn, just the fact -- I think it changes day to day, but on the reimbursements, which are obviously the most complicated thing around, I think our goal -- we're tracking to be 95% complete by tomorrow and then have them all wrapped up by next -- probably early next week. So we're moving through them very quickly. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you, all very much. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Kyle Arnold : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious, could you talk a little bit more about that $1.3 billion in technology spending? Is that back-end infrastructure? And does that include things like the upgrades to WiFi and the in-flight improvements that you're making this year? Tammy Romo : The technology spend, yeah, it would include all -- everything that you referenced. And again, the $1.3 billion includes technology, the upgrades and the ongoing maintenance of the system. The -- but the WiFi piece of that, it does not include. So that would be incremental. Bob Jordan : It's really our investment and ongoing support of the -- of our technology infrastructure, including all investments, but it's not the customer investments like the WiFi on the aircraft. Kyle Arnold : Thanks. And are there any specific upgrades like you guys have worked on the maintenance systems, anything that you are actively working on? It was probably in place before the December event. But any other systems that will get an upgrade this year as part of your plans? Andrew Watterson : We have a couple that are ongoing at different levels of maturation, if you will. So we just finished up with the maintenance replacement just recently. That was a big event. We're in the middle of upgrading our ground ops infrastructure, so one of our efforts you may have seen it from Investor Day, a paperless turn. So we're upgrading -- and that comes in so many releases, some of which have already deployed and now allow us to eliminate all of our paper in our turn. That's part of -- modernizing operation within our control center. And we have an operation system and a flight planning system. Both of those have RFPs that have already been completed, and the work has been awarded. And then in our cruise system, we have just completed an RFI, which is what you do before you do an RFP. And so we'll get the results of that and great lessons learned from this event and then with the next step on the crew stuff. So each of the big operating areas has tech workers underway. And as you would expect, some are further ahead than others. Bob Jordan : And Kyle, that $1.3 billion is across the enterprise. There's a lot of commercial systems that are being upgraded and invested in as well. So it's across the enterprise. Kyle Arnold : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Lori Aratani with Washington Post. Please go ahead. Lori Aratani : Hi, thank you, all for taking the time. I know that the DOT yesterday had announced a little more detail about some of the issues that they're looking into in regards to your December issues, and they mentioned that they are examining whether your schedules may have been unrealistic. I wondered if you guys had any comment on that. Andrew Watterson : Yeah, we saw that. And we know, as Bob said, we messed up, and that will include scrutiny from regulators and like officials. So we understand that, and we'll cooperate fully. As I mentioned in one of the analyst reviews, if you -- if one were worried about with your schedule operable, then you'd expect to see poor on-time performance for reliability. And to the contrary, really well before the Christmas vacation, including Thanksgiving vacation in November, we've been running above average in the industry, culminate even being number one this month. So you don't see the signs of a schedule that is out of whack with the resources ability to operate given our strong operating performance over the last three months. Bob Jordan : And just generally, there's a lot of talk about hearings and, obviously, the coordination with the DOT. And we're obviously coordinating and cooperating with our oversight committees. And I mean we welcome the discussion. We welcome the focus on the resiliency of the aviation system. We've had several personal conversations with the Secretary just in terms of how we're doing and our focus on our customers and his focus on customers as well, and we're aligned, obviously there. So we would -- we'll support all of this, as you would expect. Lori Aratani : Thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Lori. Operator : The next question is from Chris Isidore with CNN. Please go ahead. Chris Isidore : So I'm wondering if you think that the computer system used for crew scheduling can be repaired or if your intention is to replace it entirely as part of this process. And whichever solution is used, do you have any estimate for how much it will cost to either fix or repair it and how long it will take before the repaired or new system is fully in place? Andrew Watterson : Thank you. As we mentioned earlier, there's an upgrade already in our test system from GE Digital. So the upgrades in there. We haven't even talked costs. I don't not sure if it's going to cause us anything or not, but it will be upgraded here in the production in a few weeks' time, and we think this addresses the shortcoming we have for the specific instance. Bob Jordan : And just to get a reminder that this GE system, Sky Solver, it's an industry tool that many airlines use. It performs well, and it performed as it should. And even in our event, what was revealed was this requirement that no one has ever seen, we would ever seen, where the -- you have this need to solve past problems because there are so many problems coming and just volume coming out of the system. And working with GE, they have put a fix in place and now in test in weeks, I mean, a record time. So the software, again, it's industry standard crew scheduling or rescheduling software that we and others use, and it did perform as intended during the event. Chris Isidore : So just to be clear, the problems with crew members letting you know where they were and where things stood having to call in rather than having an app to notify, you don't see a need to change the system fundamentally to have a more electronic form of notification? Bob Jordan : That's different. Andrew Watterson : As I mentioned earlier, that was a problem. We have been a problem, it wasn't the problem for the situation. It was a symptom of the problem. And so our contracts with our crews right now require telephone calls in these situations. In other situations, we have some level of electronic communication available now. We will make incremental improvements to that. Some have already been deployed now and some will be deployed in the next few months. But to have a more comprehensive electronic communication requires changes to the contract with the crew members. Those are open right now. We're discussing it with our unions. And should they agree, then we will develop new crew communication tools consistent with the contract for development as soon as practical. Chris Isidore : Have you raised the possibility of opening the contract for that one issue and having to -- because as we understand it from the statements from the unions during the December, they were not fans of the current system about. Having an agreement on a new notification and new electronic crew notification system now before you get to the entire contract itself because the entire contract itself could obviously take months. Ryan Green : Well, the entire contract's been for a while. We're in mediation, which hopefully, as Bob said, means we're towards the tail end of it, and it's not -- we would certainly be open to that if they want to do that. They've not told us that they want to do that. But if they want a site agreement before based on just communications, we will certainly do that. But right now, the approach has been to have that incorporated into this final push of the current contracts, and I think that's wise and practical for us to work on. So we're happy either way. But right now, we've seen no indication than the current path. . Chris Isidore : Okay. Thank you. Ryan Green : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, we have time for one more additional question, and that question will be from Richard Velotta from Las Vegas Review Journal. Please go ahead. Richard Velotta : Thank you, and good day. You indicated that added capacity by Southwest do several destinations will not be curtailed despite what happened in December. But we're hearing that Harry Reed International is starting to have internal capacity problems and that airlines might not have much choice in terms of when their operations occur. Has Southwest had any problem scheduling their times of operations as the airline schedule grows in Las Vegas? And do you think the future capacity issues in Las Vegas could curtail flights in the future? Andrew Watterson : Right now, we've seen no general capacity constraints to our operation and at Harry Reed International. It's normal as an airline -- an airport grows that you work on expand capacity in different areas. You work on taxiways, you work on bag systems. These are all normal course of business and Harry Read seems to have a good plan and execute upon that in coordination with the airline. So we're happy about that. I will note that Las Vegas has been so successful in attracting new attractions. We do see a lot of general aviation or private aircraft in the weekends that kind of add a surge of demand. But other than that, we see no changes to the environment. Richard Velotta : And is it Andrew? Andrew Watterson : Yes, sir. Richard Velotta : Thank you. Andrew Watterson : Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. If you all have any other questions or follow up, our communications group is standing by at (214) 792-4847 or, of course, through our media newsroom at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much for joining us. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to our GAAP results in our press release. So, please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We incurred a first quarter net loss that was in line with our expectations, driven by a $380 million pretax negative financial impact related to the December operational disruption, roughly $325 million of that was from lower revenue in January and February, much of that cancellations of holiday return trips. We saw a strong rebound in revenue trends in March, resulting in record first quarter revenues despite the impact of the December disruption. Travel demand remained strong thus far, but we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment. You have to be given all the headlines and trends we are seeing across many industries. We have tough year-over-year revenue comparisons here in the second quarter with last year\u2019s domestic revenue environment getting a boost from international closures. Taking that into consideration, demand, particularly leisure continues to show strength as we head into the busy summer travel season. Our cost outlook is higher this year due to a few moving parts, as we are making additional investments in the operation based on our learnings from December. I won\u2019t go through all of our key findings and work to shore up our winter preparedness because we\u2019ve done that a few times now, I am very proud of our people for the operation they have delivered this year and for the relentless focus on executing our plan to fortify the operation in preparation for winter 2023. Despite the near-term cost pressures, we have not lost focus on our goal to effectively manage the real inflationary cost increases we are seeing and equally as important, maintain our competitive cost position. As we look ahead, we currently expect solid profits here in Q2. We continue to expect solid profits for full year with the goal to grow full year margins and ROIC year-over-year as well as have our route network roughly restored by year-end. We are reducing our full year 2023 growth plans due to a lower planning assumption for Boeing MAX deliveries this year. This relates to the recent news of further supply chain challenges at Boeing. The outcome is a reduction to our 2023 capacity and CapEx outlook, and we are currently reevaluating our hiring needs relative to our most recent expectation to hire more than 7,000 net new employees this year. We will be moderating our overall hiring plans as we get into the second half of 2023. In the meantime, we are most focused on revisions to our second half 2023 flight schedules to account for fewer aircraft, which Andrew will cover in more detail. I\u2019m very proud of the progress we are making on our customer experience enhancements. As a reminder, we are investing in three onboard initiatives, enhanced Wi-Fi, in-seat power and larger overhead bins. In early March, our first new aircraft with hardware from our new Wi-Fi provider, Viasat, entered revenue service. By third quarter, we expect all of our existing aircraft to be flying with upgraded Wi-Fi and Anuvu hardware, offering increased speed and reliability. So just great progress on that front. Our new MAX 8 deliveries are coming into service with in-seat power and larger overhead bins. So, those are already entering service as well. We\u2019re also very-focused on mobile and other enhancements on our technology road map to offer more self-service options for our customers to give them more flexibility and ease during their journey. Highlighting one of our stronghold markets, Southwest is the number one airline in Kansas City, growing from 6 flights in 1982 to 75 flights today. And I\u2019m proud to say that our service in Kansas City is now fully restored the pre-pandemic levels. We recently celebrated the opening of the new Kansas City Airport in February, and we serve as the Chair of the Airport and Airlines Affairs Committee. We really appreciated the opportunity to partner with the airport to deliver a beautiful new terminal that will serve us and the community well for a very long period of time. It was a great partnership all the way around, and it is a beautiful facility. We continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people and we continue to make progress. We just reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, which represents our Meteorologists, and I want to commend both negotiating committees for the spirit of cooperation that led to that agreement. We remain focused on negotiations with the union representing our ramp in ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants and remain committed to competitive market compensation packages for our people. We are very eager to get new contracts and have a significant amount of wage rate increases and have already been accrued and set aside and we look forward to rewarding those remaining groups soon. In closing, I\u2019m just so very proud of our people. They are the hardest Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And despite the negative impacts in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are carefully managing the business in the near term, and we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and set of initiatives. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter loss is disappointing and not how we hope to start 2023. However, the quarter was not without notable accomplishments. Our ontime performance year-to-date through March was solid. Our operations team navigated through a stream of difficult weather conditions successfully with no material impact to our network performance. And despite the negative revenue impact from December operational disruption, we still had record first quarter passenger revenues and record other revenue. We also ended the quarter with strong double-digit margins for the month of March despite high fuel prices. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance and outlook, so I will jump right in to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuels. Our first quarter jet fuel price was $3.19 per gallon, which was on the high end of our guidance range. Throughout first quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, while prices dipped to about $65 per barrel in mid-March, they primarily hovered around $80 per barrel throughout first quarter. On the other hand, refining margins remained volatile during first quarter after hitting a 10-year high last year. Thankfully, market prices have fallen over recent weeks, in particular, crack spreads, which is a welcome relief. We are 51% hedged for our second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.55 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.69 lower than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.13 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of roughly $70 million in second quarter alone. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.60 to $2.70 per gallon range, down a nickel from our previous guidance and still including $0.10 of hedging gains. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance based on the April 19th forward curve and market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 51% hedged next year as well. We began building our 2025 portfolio and are about 10% hedged. The total market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for second quarter 2023 through 2025 is $418 million. We will continue to see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 5.9% was in line with our guidance range. As expected, we experienced inflationary cost pressures, primarily higher labor costs, including market wage rate accruals for all employee groups as well as increased technology spending and higher rates for airport and benefit costs. The remainder of the increase was primarily driven by operational disruption related expenses. Looking ahead, we currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the 5% to 8% range year-over-year, largely driven by general inflationary cost pressures that we expect to persist and are not unique to Southwest. In addition to higher labor rates, we continue to accrue for market wage rate increases for the remaining open labor contracts. And as we further refine our multiyear maintenance planning, we have additional maintenance expense this year for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance and this is adding further pressure to our second quarter cost inflation. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 3.5% to 5.5%. Approximately 1 point of this year-over-year increase is due to lower capacity as a result of Boeing delivery delays and the remainder of the change in guidance is driven by the timing of maintenance expenses for our -800 fleet, a continuation of what we are experiencing here in the second quarter. As a reminder, our full year CASM-X guidance continues to include higher labor rates, including market wage rate accruals for the remaining open labor contracts as well as the estimated tens of millions of dollars of additional investments we expect to incur towards our operational resiliency. Turning to our fleet. We received a total of 30 aircraft deliveries during first quarter as expected, ending the quarter with 793 aircraft, which is a net of seven -700 retirements, two more than previously planned as we shifted up a couple of retirements from the second half of this year. Looking at the full year, based on the recent production issues at Boeing, we feel it\u2019s prudent to have a more conservative planning assumption and are now planning around 70 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared with our previous assumption of approximately 90 -8 deliveries. As a result, we have lowered our full year 2023 capacity guidance by roughly 1 point to up 14% to 15% year-over-year, which impacts our second half capacity assumptions closely and fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have a surplus of underutilized aircraft and our fleet due to pilot hiring constraints. Therefore, the reduction in our delivery should not impact our summer flight schedule. We continue to expect our second quarter capacity to be up 14% year-over-year. Our planned deliveries continue to differ from our contractual order book. In addition to the recent aircraft delivery delays, which are not reflected in our contractual order book, we continue to reflect 46 undelivered 2022 contractual aircraft deliveries as 2023 deliveries in the order book, further outlined in our press release. But to be very clear, we are currently planning our published schedules around the delivery of 70 -8 aircraft this year, and we intend to solidify our order book with Boeing soon. In regards to our current CapEx outlook for this year, we now estimate to spend approximately $3.5 billion, reflecting our updated delivery assumptions of 70 aircraft this year compared with our previous guidance of approximately $4 billion, which assumes roughly 90 aircraft deliveries. Lastly, a quick note on our balance sheet. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $11.7 billion after paying $59 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in first quarter. We continue to expect a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments for full year 2023, including roughly $10 million in scheduled debt repayments here in second quarter. We also paid $214 million in dividends in the first quarter as our pre-pandemic dividend is fully restored. And based on our current expectations, we continue to expect 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We continue to be in a net cash position, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, this was not the first quarter performance we had planned back at Investor Day. However, I am immensely proud of our people and their perseverance. There is still work to be done to fully recover, but we are currently forecasting a substantial improvement sequentially to the bottom line with solid profitability this quarter. We are laser-focused on managing ongoing inflationary cost increases, regaining better operating leverage and maintaining our competitive cost advantage. We have not lost sight of our goals or the warrior spirit of Southwest Airlines, and I\u2019m eager to move forward along our path of success for many years to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Ryan Green : Thank you, Tammy. I\u2019ll take a minute to expand on the commentary in our press release this morning and provide more color on our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Our first quarter revenue trends remained steady and within expectations throughout the quarter, with first quarter revenue growth of 21.6% year-over-year. This was right at the midpoint of guidance going back to our January earnings call. And as a reminder, we had two competing storylines in first quarter that played out as we anticipated. First, we incurred an estimated $325 million negative revenue impact that was isolated to January and February. This was the result of cancellations for return holiday travel and a slowdown in bookings following our operational disruptions in late December. We believe these negative revenue impacts have subsided and are now behind us. We saw the reverse over the second half of the quarter and witnessed strong revenue trends throughout March. That showed up in terms of overall demand, rapid reward redemptions and yields. And so, even with the negative revenue impact at the beginning of the quarter, we had record first quarter operating revenues of $5.7 billion and record first quarter RASM of $0.15. Managed business revenues also improved significantly throughout the quarter and by March were nearly restored to March 2019 levels, just shy of 100%. That is tremendous progress, and it feels like we\u2019re very close to full corporate revenue recovery at Southwest. Our managed business revenues have trended ahead of the industry due to our revenue initiatives in the corporate space, and this is driving new corporate accounts which of course, opens up access to incremental new pools of corporate passengers. And while the managed business recovery still isn\u2019t consistent across traveler sector or size of accounts, we expect further sequential improvement in managed business revenues from first quarter to second quarter. How the demand comes in may be a bit choppy with more volumes further out in the booking curve, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be unique in the industry based on ARC data. Regardless, we expect to continue making market share gains in the managed business space as we gained another point of market share in first quarter while we expect to grow passenger volume from our initiatives on very solid yields. In terms of the leisure booking curve, it has moved further out from what we saw last summer and fall and seems to have more or less normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Leisure demands and yields, which are well above pre-pandemic levels, continue to be strong heading into summer, and we\u2019re currently seeing the sequential improvements in operating revenue and yields that we would expect in the seasonally strong second quarter. All in all, the overall domestic revenue environment remains strong, and our initiatives are performing in line with our expectations. So in short, we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re currently seeing. Our second quarter RASM guidance range of down 8% to 11% contains a 4.5-point year-over-year headwind. As a reminder, second quarter 2022 operating revenues included approximately $300 million of additional breakage revenue, a higher-than-normal amount related to flight credits issued during the pandemic that were soon set to expire as well as our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Adjusting for this headwind, our second quarter RASM guidance would be down around 5%, and we\u2019re pleased with the core trends we\u2019re seeing. This year-over-year headwind will not persist in the second half of 2023. We\u2019re also pleased with the performance of our Rapid Rewards program, co-brand credit card and all ancillary products in first quarter, and we\u2019re expecting another strong year-over-year performance in second quarter. We saw a first quarter record of new Rapid Rewards members added to the program and also had a first quarter record of ancillary revenue per passenger. And finally, our portfolio of new cities, including Hawaii, continue to mature. I\u2019m also proud to announce that we have completed the selection and rollout of our new revenue management system, which is the Amadeus Network Revenue Management product. Our implementation timing is slightly ahead of our previous timeline of mid-2023 and we\u2019re very pleased with the revenue results we saw from Amadeus during the production pilot. We are encouraged about the future opportunity for incremental revenue, which really starts in earnest in third quarter as the new Amadeus product is now fully implemented and is currently managing all future bookings and departure dates. This is just an excellent job by our revenue management team to skillfully manage multiple revenue management systems as we recovered from the pandemic and which ultimately led to this selection. I\u2019m just very proud of the team. In closing, I want to mention that we have watched our brand metrics very closely since the disruption and our scores have improved significantly throughout the first quarter. We are very fortunate to have a loyal customer base at Southwest that we do not take for granted, and we\u2019ll continue to communicate to them about our remediation plans and aim to consistently deliver the hospitality, customer service and operational reliability they are accustomed to from us at Southwest. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some color on the operation before we jump into Q&A. Following our event in late December, I am proud of the quick rebound we had in early January and the strong operational performance that our employees delivered in Q1. While Q1 was tough weather-wise, our people did a tremendous job quickly recovering from the regular operations. In the days following each event, we had no material hangover in our aircraft or crew networks. We maintained solid operational metrics and completion factor. This is evidence that our processes for irregular operations are solid and working as designed. For the quarter, we finished number 2 out of 10 airlines and on-time performance, which reflects well on our people. Most recently, while on April 18th, we experienced a double firewall failure that resulted in an unexpected loss of connection to some operational data. While our technology teams worked quickly to resolve the issue that morning, out of abundance of caution, we temporarily ground stopped the airline. It was a pretty quick fix by the Southwest team and a little more than an hour, we lifted the ground stop more back to safely operating flights. While this type of event drives flight delays across the network, we canceled only 22 flights on April 18th. We had no material impact on our operations the following day. Even with the delay of that day, we ran 75% on time within an hour scheduled departure times and 95% within 2 hours. While we don\u2019t like those delays, this represents an admiral recovery by our people, all things considered. Regarding our operational disruption remediation plan, Bob covered that in detail at the JPMorgan conference in mid-March, and that presentation is available on the Investor Relations website. Since then, we also provided greater detail on the microsite, e-mailed our customers with a readout of the key findings and remediation items we want in place by winter 2023. Therefore, I\u2019m not going to walk through it again today. I just want to reiterate that we have a solid plan and our work is on track. Turning to capacity. Our lower aircraft delivery expectations this year is driving lower capacity expectations in second half 2023. As a result, our full year 2023 capacity growth is now expected to be in the range of 14% to 15% year-over-year. We\u2019re in the process of refining our published flight schedules post summer as we are reevaluating our flight schedule plans for our yet to be published November-December flight schedules. We expect to have those schedules published in the next month or so, but our current estimates are that we will trim plane capacity from September through December in the post summer travel period. This now puts us roughly 2 points lower than our original capacity plan for this year, with Q3 being 1 point lower and Q4 being 6 to 7 points lower on a year-over-year basis. Despite the lower capacity growth, nearly all of the capacity growth is still going back into key Southwest markets and adding market depth. There was no material change in our capacity allocation approach this year. And we continue to expect to have our route network roughly restored by the end of this year. I want to wrap up by commending the negotiating team of TWU 550, who represents our Meteorologists and it just reached a tentative agreement that will be voted on by our employees soon. We have now come to agreement with 9 of 12 work groups covered by collective bargaining agreements. We\u2019ll continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups, and we are eager to get these deals wrapped up, so the remainder of our employees can begin receiving increased compensation we are eager to pay them. We continue to accrue market and competitive wage rates for our employees, which means our financial results and guidance already reflect their estimated raises. And with that, I will turn it back over to Ryan Martinez. Ryan Martinez : Thank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions. So, a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Just on costs, I totally appreciate you have a business to run and there\u2019s moving pieces. But the slow drip of these CASM revisions has been painful for your investors. And so, my question is, do you feel like the band-aid is finally being ripped off today? And what are the circumstances that would cause you to raise your CASM expectations again this year? Bob Jordan : Hey Duane. Yes. I\u2019ll start and Tammy can clean up here. But most of what you\u2019ve seen are revisions. I mean, there\u2019s real inflation out there. Some of it is that. A lot of it is continuing to revise for labor accruals as the market changes. If you take our pilots, for example, the best marker out there is delta in terms of rates and benefits. And so you can assume that we\u2019re fully accrued for all open contracts to those rates. We\u2019ve got a little more inflation here that showed up around maintenance on our 800s. Some of that is just timing pulling some \u201824 into \u201823 around engine visits, for example. It\u2019s hard to know on the inflation front. But yes, I think you could expect that for the most part, we\u2019re pretty clean at this point. I don\u2019t expect -- I mean the other driver, obviously, would be if we had a further change in our capacity expectation for 2023, I don\u2019t expect that. I think this move from 90 down to 70 will help us get a real clean view on our capacity set. And therefore, any impact on -- the 1 point impact on CASM for the year. But no, Tammy, what else would you add? Tammy Romo : Yes. No, I think you covered it, Bob. Yes, the primary cost pressure is salary, wages and benefits, and that\u2019s clearly driven by inflationary pressures here. So, certainly not unique to us. And capacity, as always, is going to have an impact on our CASM-X at the end of the day. But we -- our second quarter cost here, at least the profile should be pretty fully loaded, so to speak. That said, we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities to improve. We have our ongoing operations modernization plan. So, we\u2019ve incorporated that best we can. And of course, as we move forward, we have opportunities as we gain operating leverage with the network. So, understand the question. But when we have capacity changes, that typically does drive some change in CASM-X. So, that\u2019s the primary culprit here as we look at 2023. Bob Jordan : Duane, I think the other thing that\u2019s helpful, too, is we\u2019ve been pretty forthcoming that we\u2019re -- especially on the hiring front, we\u2019re hiring ahead to prepare for growth. A lot of that this year coming in \u201824, I think this further revision with Boeing from 90 down to 70 is going to help us go back through, look at our hiring plans, moderate our hiring plans at this point between the 46 aircraft that were undelivered from last year, now you got an additional 20, then 66. We -- that are stacked up forward. We\u2019re not taking 152 aircraft next year. So we have the opportunity to go back, work with Boeing, reflow the order book. I mean, we want all of the aircraft in the book here because we got a good deal, but reflow the order book in a way that is smooth, it is orderly growth, and I think that will help us with wring out this pre-hiring, advanced hiring to prepare for growth as well and regain efficiencies as we move through the rest of the year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on breakage. I hope this is the last quarter we hear about it. But given the dynamics in 2Q, do you think the June quarter will be your weakest year-over-year RASM -- down RASM quarter? And what RASM outcome are you managing in the back half of the year too? Thank you for taking the questions. Tammy Romo : Yes, sure. Thanks, Duane. Yes. Obviously, we had challenging comparisons here in the second quarter given breakage last year. So, we do expect that to be the last quarter with that headwind. And aside from that, yes, we also had, I would say, difficult compares here. As you\u2019re aware, Duane, last year, the domestic revenue environment was a very robust, benefited -- just not specific to Southwest, but just in general, benefited from international closures last year, making comparisons here in the second quarter challenging. But as Ryan covered very thoroughly in his remarks, we\u2019re seeing demand strength here in the second quarter and at this point, trends look strong. Bob Jordan : Yes. The only thing I\u2019ll add there, Duane, is that it\u2019d be tough. I think clearly, the financial headlines and the macro environment, we\u2019ve got to be mindful of that and what\u2019s happening around this year. But so far, we\u2019ve seen no impact on air travel, the revenue looks good here for the second quarter and what we can see, it\u2019s probably tough to speculate beyond second quarter and into the second half of the year. We\u2019ll just have to -- as we get kind of mid-July timeframe and get a view into mid-August and into the fall, we\u2019ll have a better idea of how things are shaping up beyond the sequentially strong second quarter. But again, nothing but strong trends here as we look forward and out into the summer. Operator : And the next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : So, Andrew, I want to follow up on the capacity cuts. When you were talking through the point of capacity, you said some -- maybe I misheard sure, but I thought you said a point out of Q3 and then like 6 points or something out of Q4. I didn\u2019t really understand it. And then more importantly, what does this mean for capacity next year? Is there now more growth next year to catch up? Is there less growth because we\u2019re just going to continue this? How do I think about that? Andrew Watterson : Well, I\u2019ll start off, and then Tammy and Bob can chime in. But the impact to the delivery book from the Boeing quality escape means that the -- effectively, it\u2019s the kind of fourth quarter where you\u2019ll be -- short of the aircraft and then for those schedules will bear the brunt. From September through December, those schedules will be less than originally projected. So we will modify those schedules to make sure we reflect the lower aircraft count. September and October will be modest revisions to what was already published. We actually publish those schedules with some easily movable aircraft to hedge our bets in case something did happen, so that will be fairly clean. And then we were about to publish November-December. Now, we\u2019re going to go back and redevelop November-December with a lower aircraft count to reflect business. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive the capacity lower during that period of time versus the original plan. And then for next year, I think Bob touched on when we talked about reflowing the order book because these aircraft that were not delivered last year, not delivered this year, you can\u2019t just assume they\u2019re bunching up and they\u2019re all coming once next year because that would be -- we\u2019re looking for an orderly growth, as Bob said. So, as we refill that order book, then we can look to how that -- what that means for \u201824, \u201825. Bob Jordan : Yes. I think the other thing just to point out is maybe related is the -- we talked a lot about what\u2019s constraining the airline. And right now, that is pilot hiring. So, we have aircraft effectively that we are not producing capacity out of today because the constraint is just pilots. A lot of -- a lot of carriers are dealing with this, and that was going to true up roughly at the end of the year. Now, with the order book dropping, the deliveries issue dropping from 90 to 70, that\u2019s the point at which the pilot constraint turns into an aircraft constraint is -- will definitely be earlier. It will be post summer, late third quarter, early fourth quarter. We\u2019ll flip to aircraft constrained from pilot constrained. And we\u2019ll just take that into account as we -- again, as we think about hiring and planning for this year and then planning again for next year because again, a lot of the hiring is planning for growth next year. So number one, the constraint will flip to aircraft constrained. And then second, we want -- again, as Andrew said, we want orderly growth. We don\u2019t want 152 aircraft next year. We want to grow. We have a lot of opportunities, but we want that growth to be orderly and measured and as consistent as we can be year to year to year. So hopefully, that helps with just thinking about capacity next year and how that relates to the order book. We have work to do with Boeing, obviously. The news is still pretty fresh about 10 days or so all we have work to do to -- with Boeing to just think about how to reflow the order book here, and we\u2019ll get through that and keep you informed as we do that. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you. And then just more near-term question. When I look at the second quarter RASM guide, if I add back the $325 million book away from back to Q1, it implies a pretty meaningful deceleration in RASM, at least like versus 2019 levels or maybe less of a sequential uptick in RASM than we typically see 1Q to 2Q. Any thoughts on why we\u2019re seeing that trend show? Andrew Watterson : Yes, Scott. I think if you look here, we\u2019ve looked at this a lot of different ways and you think about what the guide and what revenue performance is looking like here as we go into the second quarter. The first quarter has got a lot of noise in there, whether you\u2019ve got Omicron last year or you\u2019ve got our disruption this year. And also, in addition to that there is a lot of international tailwinds out there in the industry that while international is strong for us, we just -- obviously, we don\u2019t have as much exposure to that as some of our peers in the industry. And so, when you isolate to the domestic performance and you go back to pre-pandemic, whether you\u2019re looking at 2018, 2019, and kind of projecting that forward in terms of growth and revenue performance. When we look at fourth quarter, no matter really how you cut it, fourth quarter to second quarter, first quarter to second quarter, we\u2019re pleased with how that ends up, what that comparison looks like. And it looks to us like it\u2019s relatively in line with what else is out there. Bob Jordan : I think the other thing just -- the other thing I think I would add is just we are seeing, as Ryan pointed out in his remarks, we\u2019re seeing strong business demand here. We were just right at restored to 2019 levels in March, which I think is a remarkable accomplishment and I think industry-leading in terms of our ability to get there that quickly. It\u2019s going to be choppy a little bit here in the second quarter, but we do expect sequential improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter in terms of business bookings and managed business. And I\u2019m just really proud of that. But on top of that, you\u2019ve got obviously the investments we\u2019ve made in business, GDS, those are showing up. We\u2019ve got -- and Ryan can talk to this, we\u2019ve got -- we made our selection around a new revenue management system with Amadeus, actually made that selection earlier than we talked about at Investor Day. That system is now managing all forward bookings, all forward travel periods, and we expect good revenue results from the system as well. So, a lot of other positives that will come on here as you move forward across the year. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : So, if we adjust for the January and February book away and then take the midpoint of your second quarter demand guide, it looks like sequential revenue from the first to the second quarters, pretty much in line with ordinary pre-COVID seasonality. So, is the takeaway that the book away has fully ceased and the brand is intact? Bob Jordan : Yes. I think the -- I think that\u2019s a really good way to summarize how we\u2019re thinking about it as well, just in terms of sequential -- think about the sequential trend there. But yes, we feel like the revenue impact from the ops disruption, most of it was holiday return travel that obviously was canceled because the outbounds weren\u2019t there. And we had some book away, it feels like it was isolated to January and February. March was really strong. We had double-digit margins in March, very strong demand. As Ryan pointed out, we had record additions in terms of rapid reward members in the first quarter. So, there\u2019s a lot of evidence of strength. As you look into the second quarter, we don\u2019t see any evidence of book away at this point. The trends are strong. Now, we have work to do. Let me just acknowledge that when you look at just -- we do a lot of brand surveys. And as we look at all of that, there is work to do across the year to continue to restore some of our brand health as completely expected following what happened in December. The numbers are improved tremendously from December through April here. We\u2019re seeing that moves up very, very quickly. But we need to run a reliable operation for our customers. We\u2019re doing that. We were number two in the first quarter and had completion factors that were up 2 points year-over-year, on-time performance that I think was up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. We are focused on delivering a wonderful product with great hospitalities -- hospitality from our employees. We need to execute. But no, there\u2019s no evidence at this point that the book away is continuing. Trends are strong, but we do have work to do on the brand front. Andrew Watterson : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add on to that, Jamie, is that we have confidence in that because we have really good visibility. Not only are we watching the scores in confidence and trust and consideration for Southwest for their next trip. And like Bob said, those scores have improved dramatically over the first -- or significantly over the first -- the course of the first quarter here. And when you look into the second quarter, we\u2019ve got really good visibility. About 75% of the quarter is booked at this point. We got 50% of June booked at this point. And so, all signs look really good and strong for the second quarter. Leisure demand is strong. Managed business is going to sequentially improve here, looks like in the second quarter from where we were in the first. And assuming we continue on plan here and what we\u2019re forecasting, we\u2019re set to turn in another record revenue performance in the second quarter. So like Bob said, we have work to do. We just need to continue to execute and be the Southwest Airlines that customers have grown to know and love. But in terms of bookings, no evidence of any sort of hangover. Jamie Baker : So, that\u2019s kind of a good segue, I guess, into my next question. So from a passenger perspective, or let\u2019s say, a new passenger. So somebody that\u2019s just starting to fly, they\u2019ve reached that economic level or they\u2019re just entering the workforce, whatever. Somebody that\u2019s not already loyal, what\u2019s the value proposition for flying Southwest these days? I mean, I get it in a point-to-point -- for point-to-point operations, many instances where you\u2019re going to be up, your only competitors are connecting flights. So, that\u2019s a no-brainer. But in truly competitive markets, if the price is equal and if a passenger isn\u2019t already led to your brand or your credit card ecosystem, what does Southwest do to attract that first-time buyer? Bob Jordan : I think the brand strengths that have been in place for -- for 52 years are still there. You have -- we have a -- and even better, we have a tremendous network, again, far more nonstop direct flights, we have terrific service, on-time performance, all those things are improving as well. We\u2019re continuing to work on the customer experience. We have new deliveries that are coming now with power on the aircraft. We have larger the larger overhead bins. We have improved Wi-Fi. We have our terrific employees and service. And of course, we have really good everyday low fares. So, those brand strengths have not changed. If you look at something like the larger overhead bins -- and again, it\u2019s a small sample size. We have it on a relatively small number of aircraft at this point, but we\u2019re watching the data. It\u2019s reducing in what we -- Andrew check me, but in what we\u2019ve seen so far, it\u2019s reducing gate check bags by 60%. That\u2019s a huge win for our customers. It\u2019s a big win for us as well. It certainly helps with cost. It\u2019s, again, a modest amount of data, but it\u2019s reducing turn times as well on our aircraft. But back to your question, I mean, the value proposition that has always existed for Southwest Airlines for over 50 years is still true today. When you look at -- one of the things we look at constantly before the ops disruption and after is consideration, where do we sit in the consideration set, both for customers of Southwest and customers that are, for the first time, considering Southwest Airlines. And those numbers are really strong. They dipped of course, during the disruption, but they\u2019ve come back quickly and tells me that we don\u2019t have a hangover from the ops disruption. Andrew Watterson : No. I largely would say the same exact thing. The things that have made Southwest Airlines great historically, in my mind, are only better today, and I think customers understand that. And despite what happened in December, and Bob said many times that that\u2019s not going to define us going forward, and it doesn\u2019t. When you look at our brand scores, customers new and existing give us a whole lot of credit. We\u2019re by far the most customer-friendly and business-friendly airline in terms of great service at a great price with the most rewarding frequent flyer program. We win time and time again. More seats are redemption seats on Southwest Airlines than any of our competitors, not even close. So we\u2019re by far the most rewarding airline. And when you look at our stable of customer-friendly policies with bags fly free, no change fees forever regardless of the fare that you fly and we\u2019re even making it more flexible with flight credits that don\u2019t expire. I think the value proposition is only getting better. Bob Jordan : If you look, Jamie, at the use case, you talked about a new flyer, the entry-level product is where we shine. So, we have I would assert the highest-quality economy product. Others offer a basic economy or other type of product, which is stripped down penalizing, whereas you fly us, you\u2019re flying a regular economy that\u2019s got ample legroom. 50% of our aircraft now are 800s or MAXs, which has a 32-inch of pitch. So you have a much better physical products, you have much better policies and procedures. Our people are joy to deal with rather than the opposite. So, a new flyer would come forward to us and go, \"Oh, wow, this is great. This is so much better than the other airlines.\" And that\u2019s where then they say, \"Well, I\u2019ll fly them again.\" So, our level of repeat purchase is really high. We don\u2019t disclose it, but other airlines disclose theirs, and we know that our repeat purchase is much higher. So, we give them that first experience, and they come back. Operator : And the next question will come from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Matt Roberts : This is Matt on for Savi. If I could just follow up on Duane\u2019s question earlier regarding the CASM-X guidance increases. Could you elaborate on how much of these costs are fixed and expected to carry through to 2024? And also given that the capacity cuts are weighted sort of late in 2023, I think there\u2019s more of a variable cost component helping to offset that. So, why is that not the case? Or any additional color there would be great. Thanks. Tammy Romo : Yes. Sure, Matt. And just sharing a few thoughts. We\u2019re -- so again, first of all, the cost pressures are not unique to Southwest. But even with those inflationary pressures, we are bending our CASM-X down this year and we still feel good about our competitive position. So, we\u2019ve got the labor contracts accrued. We\u2019ve got those accrued in our long term -- or reflected in our long-term targets. And we are very focused on bending our cost down again in 2024. Specific to your question, we do have some onetime costs here this year related to the operational disruptions, and that\u2019s probably in the $100 million to $150 million range, and that shouldn\u2019t repeat next year. So, as Bob covered very thoroughly, the -- what we need to focus on now is solidifying our fleet plan and our capacity plan for next year. But as we look ahead, driving our unit cost down is certainly our goal. And as we get further in our planning, obviously, we\u2019ll provide more guidance there. Bob Jordan : As you think about too related to where -- how we are thinking about growth and where flights are going, we\u2019ve been very upfront that this year is about restoring the network and despite the reduction in aircraft deliveries, we will still get back to -- to getting back to right at fully restored by the end of this year. So, the revenues that come on are into more mature markets. And so, it should contribute at a much faster rate. As you think about 2024, what is going with cost, related to that is it\u2019s our intent to really push -- as we talked about at Investor Day, push on operating leverage. That is put majority of our new capacity in flights into stations where we have gaps during the day. And so, the costs are there. We have people, we\u2019re paying for game, we\u2019re paying for other airport costs and put flights into points of the day where we know we have demand, and we already have the cost. And so those will come -- comes on line at a significantly lower cost profile that is -- that development of additional operating leverage really is the focus for \u201824. And Andrew, I would say -- Ryan, I would say \u201825 growth as well. Matt Roberts : And then, sorry to elaborate on one question that was asked earlier as well. But in terms of the capacity plan, at the Investor Day in December, it seemed like it was not dependent on aircraft deliveries and that the initial guide provided then was firm despite any delivery delays. So what\u2019s the difference now? Is that based on the current environment and outlook that you feel the need to scale back, or is there something else? Andrew Watterson : This is Andrew. For the last year, we\u2019ve had like three elements that constrain our potential growth as we look at the back half of this year. They were flight instructors, pilots and aircraft. And so, at the time we spoke at Investor Day, at that moment in time, we were pilot constrained and knew that sometime towards the back half of this year we would flip from pilot constrained to aircraft constrained. And so we\u2019re on our pilot trajectory of hiring and training the number of piles we forecast. And so we knew that would flip over some time at the end of the year with the Boeing reductions now pulls it forward. So kind of what changed is this reduction, which is, I think, the second reduction we\u2019ve made to our assumptions for deliveries next year, has pushed us from pilot to aircraft constrained now, and that now is roughly the post-summer period, which is why you\u2019ll see us adjusting schedules post summer through the end of the year. Operator : And the next question will be from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Just on -- a follow-up question on Net Promoter Score. Is that something that you focus on? Can you share with us how that\u2019s looking sort of now versus where it was maybe in January? Ryan Green : Yes. Helane, it\u2019s Ryan. We measure Net Promoter Score and focus on it on a weekly basis, if not on a daily basis. And there\u2019s really -- we track actually two types of Net Promoter Scores. One is more as a brand overall and is a longer term measure. And then the other is based on the customers\u2019 trip that they just took based on the trip you just took would you recommend Southwest Airlines. And on the longer-term brand measures, we\u2019ve got trackers in place and like we said, some of those -- those scores have improved as we\u2019ve gone through throughout the quarter here. And Bob mentioned, overall, we\u2019re going to have to continue to focus on those longer term measures and just continue to execute to see continued upward momentum on the brand Net Promoter Score. When it gets to the actual trip Net Promoter Score, which is a little bit more near term in terms of how are we performing today, those scores have improved over the course of the first quarter really is a function of how well we have been operating over the course of the first quarter. So, we continue to operate well. Those scores should continue to improve over time as well -- in addition to the enhancements that we\u2019re making in the product, and you see those show up in Net Promoter Scores. As an example, on the aircraft that we have where we have improved and enhanced Wi-Fi, the investments are paying off. Net Promoter Scores are up. The scores on the aircraft where we have the larger overhead bins, those Net Promoter Scores on those aircraft are also up. So, as we make improvements and enhancements to the product and as we continue to execute and operate reliably, those scores should come up -- continue to come up over time. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And just to follow up briefly, earlier today, one of the other airlines that reported talked about runway construction at Las Vegas and the issues that they\u2019re experiencing in terms of delays. And Bob, you didn\u2019t mention that. And yet you have a pretty big operation there, as I recall. So I\u2019m just kind of wondering how you\u2019re seeing those issues kind of around your network contribute to any delays or disruption. Bob Jordan : Yes. And I\u2019ll let -- Helane, thank you so much for the question. I\u2019ll let Andrew weigh in, in detail. But yes, I didn\u2019t call it out specifically because I mean we have a large and complex network. And of course, there -- we work issues every single day. So, we\u2019ve talked about Florida before, you obviously are very aware of the issues that have been discussed for carriers at certain -- New York, but yes, we\u2019re experiencing issues in Vegas with the reduction in available runway capacity, and we\u2019re working with the FAA and the ATC to deal with that. But it\u2019s one component of things that happen every single day, but no, absolutely is impacting certain days our on-time performance. But Andrew, you want to give any detail? Andrew Watterson : So there is a kind of longer-term airfield construction program in Las Vegas from now through -- in August, they\u2019ve shut down -- shut down the north-south. There\u2019s two north-south runways, one left and 19 and right. So, they will shut those down for periods of time. And so, when we run in a north or south flow, that reduces capacity. So about 20% of the time when the winds are such that you provide primarily on those two runways, one of them being out will reduce our -- the throughput rate, which means you\u2019ll have delays and cancellations to cover that. 80% of the time during the time of the year, you don\u2019t rely on that configuration, in which case you should be able to operate roughly -- the schedule that airlines are scheduled. This started up, and we\u2019ve been in more north flow than usual, if you will or north than usual. And so there has -- over the last few days, there has been a spike in cancellations from the industry and from ourselves and delays in Las Vegas. So, that is a drag. It has been bigger than it was really forecasted when the construction plan was created, which did sort of catch the industry I guess off guard in the sense it was -- you\u2019re so close to end, it\u2019s hard to adjust. We\u2019ve made some adjustments we\u2019ve -- as a result of the last couple of weeks, we\u2019ve changed our minimum connect times at Las Vegas while we were looking at changing our December our crew bid to make sure the crew connections are lower. We\u2019ve changed how we set up our spares in Las Vegas to have different -- how we use our spares. We\u2019ve broken our through trips, which means the aircraft that kind of is supposed to continue through with passengers on board, that creates a bit more rigidity. We\u2019ve taken those out as well. So we\u2019ve made a lot of changes to what we do that we can do in the short term, and then we\u2019re also working with the FA -- regional FAA in Washington to how we can best collaborate to see what the tolerances are for crosswinds, so we can use a better configuration more of the time. And so, there\u2019s a good collaboration there between the FAA and the airlines on that. So, it will be a drag through August if you have more north winds than expected, but it\u2019s a normal process for airports to have to rehabilitate their runways and taxiways. Operator : The next question is from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : Just on the adjustments you\u2019re making for the full year. I realize a lot of this is out of your control, but I think you mentioned that you\u2019re still on track for network restoration. And if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m just curious on where that capacity is actually coming out. Is it all new markets, or have you just changed how you think about capacity deployment in general? Thanks. Andrew Watterson : So within restoration, you have -- restoration would be like what we flew before. And that\u2019s one bucket and say, okay, we want to restore our cities to the level of activity and the roughly the root network they had before COVID. So, that\u2019s when we say restoration we\u2019re doing that. We had the 18 new cities in the Hawaii expansion we did and we modified that at the margin. And there\u2019s airports where we currently operate and they\u2019ve had expansions with dates and infrastructure. So, we\u2019ve added more growth into there. So, it\u2019s that third bucket, so at Denver, Phoenix, where we had new gates and we\u2019re putting additional growth and they\u2019re above what they were in pre-COVID. So, they\u2019re more than restored. And so, that kind of places where we were growing above restoration because we had additional infrastructure, those will be less than they would have been if we had all these aircraft. I\u2019m not saying it will be Phoenix and Denver, but I\u2019ll use those examples. So I put in three buckets. The COVID expansions and the 18 new cities in Hawaii, the second bucket being restoring what we flew before. And the third being this newer stuff and the cities we already have a big customer base, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the flex then so that we can simultaneously keep the COVID stuff and restore our network. Conor Cunningham : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then how do you think about \u201824 -- I\u2019m just trying to parse out like how the growth may play out for you next year. So how much of the growth in \u201824 is dependent on Boeing? And then what is Southwest dependent? And in the context of like a high single-digit growth rate, is the assumption going forward that a lot of these transitory costs are actually going to allow you to have CASM-X decline next year? I\u2019m just trying to level set where we\u2019re at in terms of all that. I\u2019m not asking for a number, more directionally kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it. Thank you. Andrew Watterson : On the growth, there will be carryover. There\u2019s stuff that we will start in the back half of the year with the aircraft that are coming, and that will be a carryover growth into next year. So that will be -- you\u2019ll quickly be able to calculate that. But then the additional growth next year, that\u2019s really depending on what Bob was talking about with reflowing the aircraft. We\u2019ve got the 152 mathematically that could come that would be too much to ingest. We want an orderly growth. And so that, in addition to the carryover, that\u2019s something that\u2019s yet to be determined, but we -- it involves negotiating with Boeing and how the aircraft would flow in. Tammy Romo : Yes. And just -- but just at the end of the day is -- I mean, we\u2019re going to work on a plan that allows us to achieve our objectives, our financial objectives -- and our financial objectives as well. So we\u2019re going to take all the inputs as usual and work with Boeing to come up with a fleet plan that allows for orderly growth. But just a reminder, we do have a lot of flexibility with the aircraft. We are -- we have ongoing efforts to renew our fleet and there\u2019s value in those fleet modernization efforts. So, we\u2019ll come up with a plan that works for Southwest as we solidify our delivery schedule with Boeing. Bob Jordan : Yes. And we\u2019re early -- obviously, it\u2019s really early to be talking about 2024. And it\u2019s early to be talking about the result of the discussion with Boeing because we\u2019re just now beginning the discussion because the impact is new. I think the argument is a couple of things, is one we -- the COVID, we all work -- dealt with COVID and the capacity bounced up and down and up. And so it doesn\u2019t help to move around so much up and down year to year to year because it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s hard to manage that lumpiness or choppiness with the -- you\u2019ve seen our hiring numbers for last year and the planned hiring numbers initially for this year. That level of growth and hiring in advance for the level of deliveries we had originally planned, it just adds cost because you\u2019re constantly hiring ahead for anticipation of what\u2019s coming in the next year. So moving to something that is much more predictable. Again, we want to grow. We\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities. We want to grow. We just want that growth to be measured and orderly. And working with Boeing to come to a point where it\u2019s much more predictable year to year to year as we reflow the order book, I think, will be very, very helpful. It will be helpful in terms of how we manage ourselves here. It will be helpful in terms of how we plan and manage our costs. It will give us time to bring out inefficiencies. Again, I was talking about the advanced hiring is just one example -- an example to prepare for high levels of growth. It would give us time to settle that out, bring that out. It will give us time to work on operating leverage where we can add capacity into places where we have gaps, we can add that capacity at much lower cost. So, I think still good growth, but managed, measured, repeatable growth is much better for the Company. And that\u2019s the intent is to just take the plan, reflow and be much more predictable and less choppy year-to-year-to-year. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. David Vernon : Ryan, can you talk a little bit about what kind of load factors embedded in the 2Q guide? It just seems like when looking across the other airlines, they\u2019re one and three quarter basis points ahead of where Southwest finished first quarter in load factor. And maybe as a follow-up to that, Bob and Andrew, we\u2019re talking about restoring the network and getting back to where we were. I mean if the demand isn\u2019t there and load factors under pressure, why wouldn\u2019t we rethink that a little bit, especially if we\u2019re constrained in getting resources and having difficulty kind of getting the operation up to that level? If there\u2019s a little bit of a sign of demand with this, wouldn\u2019t we want to back away from that restoration plan a little bit? Bob Jordan : Yes. So, I\u2019ll take the load factor question. I think first quarter here, obviously, we had some -- we had the disruption that played a role here. And all of -- I think it\u2019s been widely you talked about throughout earnings season here that the booking curve is moving out a bit and we\u2019re more normalizing, more or less normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. And so -- and that\u2019s -- while there is more close-in leisure strength today than there was pre-pandemic, and it\u2019s certainly less than what it was kind of last summer and last fall. And a lot of that became evident as we worked our way through the first quarter here and we had to adjust our revenue management techniques to kind of adapt for that. And so, when you look at the stronger demand kind of 45 days and out, there\u2019s more volume there. The good news is that the fares further out in the curve are healthy, and we\u2019re getting a better mix of fares at that point in the curve than what we received than what we were getting pre-pandemic. And so, it\u2019s a manage for -- you\u2019re always managing for volume and yield there. Yields are very strong, which may have -- that will have a downward pressure on loads. And so you\u2019re just kind of managing both of those things together. But, as you look into the second quarter, I think loads and yields are strong. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s rolled out there into our guide. Andrew Watterson : I\u2019d also add to -- there\u2019s a comp here. If you think about this time last year, what we did is we -- as we did in COVID, we would republish our schedules because demand was so vacillatory. And so what that means is you sell, sell, sell and then you republish and you consolidate the customer has already purchased on to a fewer number of flights, which kind of artificially pushes up your load factor. That is a poor customer experience. We committed to stop doing that about a year ago, and so we have not done that. And so, that\u2019s going to make a load factor like-for-like more difficult. So, if our competitors largely have continued that practice, but back to kind to Jamie\u2019s question about why people choose us, we want a good customer experience. That means not changing the flight that we\u2019ve already sold them. Secondly, I would say that Ryan talked about, they put in a new revenue management system. So -- and it\u2019s been managing things for a while. I would not necessarily assume that the load factor would have been the right choice, so to say, for the RASM performance. And so, it may make different decisions with regards to load factor compared to our old system, and therefore, that element may be a little different. And the third element is we fly two different aircraft sizes, the 700 sizes and 800, and we\u2019ve been taking 800s because of 700s have not been delivered yet. And so that will, in many markets or some markets mean we have a too big of an aircraft at the current level, if you will. As we get our network completely restored, you can fill those extra seats with extra connections, but to do the extra connections, you need that restoration. So, a short haul today may not be as full because there\u2019s not an opportunity to connect to a longer haul that was there before. So as the network gets restored, that will help close some of that load factor gap on those shorter flights that are missing connectivity. Bob Jordan : Yes, I\u2019ll just put a finer point on that relative to the revenue management system. Our legacy system, the one that we just moved away from was a load factor by a system admittedly. And the new system makes better trade-offs in terms of yield and load. And so that will be playing out here as we kind of move forward. Ryan Martinez : Okay. Dave, I\u2019ll assume, you\u2019re done there. Thanks, everybody, for joining. That wraps up the analyst portion of our call today, and I will turn it back over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad, and I\u2019d like to welcome members of the media to our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion if you will give them instructions for queue up. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Alexandra Skores from the Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Alexandra Skores : I\u2019m wondering, we talked a little bit -- a lot about growth in demand over this call. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk in relation to how that\u2019s affecting airfares. And how you\u2019re looking at that going into the summer travel even. Ryan Green : Yes. Yields -- I think, in general, this is a high yield environment and I think airfares are strong. But if you look at airfares kind of going back to pre-pandemic or even earlier than that and look at them on an adjusted basis, adjusting for inflation, airfares in the industry are actually down. And so, I think both of those things are at play here. When we look at kind of how demand is coming in here into the second quarter and beyond, we are taking more volume further out in the booking curve. And of course, those fares further out in the booking curve are lower nominally than taking a lot of volume close in where the fares are higher normally -- nominally. And it\u2019s really about getting a good mix of fares across the entire booking curve, which is what\u2019s really driving our yield story here as we go forward. The other thing too is we\u2019re driving a higher average fare by offering customers things that they are happy to pay for. So, an example of that is our Wanna Get Away Plus fare that we introduced last year. That fair has a bundle of benefits that customers are choosing to pay for. It adds additional flexibility in terms of transferability, flexibility during the day of travel. And the more customers choose to buy things that are -- that they value, that drives fares overall higher without us kind of going in and filing higher fares across the board. Bob Jordan : Ryan, as you -- I\u2019m just looking for the fact, my memory is in the first quarter, peers were roughly 5%. 5, 6 or I think it\u2019s the number I\u2019ve got in my head. And again, this is not a direct correlation in -- but costs are up materially. We talked a lot about just regular inflation. You see it every day, everywhere. There\u2019s a lot of labor and wage inflation. We\u2019ve talked a lot about our costs and accruing for labor contracts. We\u2019re happy to pay our people. We want to pay our people great, but there is real wage and supply chain and other inflation year-over-year, first quarter \u201822 to first quarter \u201823. Our operating revenues were up 21.6%, which is awesome on 10% capacity. But fuel was up 54%. So just the other -- the flip side of fares is the -- you raise fares to manage your cost and there are real cost increases there. So I just want to point that out as well. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I guess, on Boeing on this latest delivery issue. I guess, how has your experience been dealing with Boeing on this one? It seems kind of -- it\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve dealt with an issue like this and just curious to know with Boeing if their communication, their ability to deliver, if those things have improved. Bob Jordan : Yes. There have been a number of things. Obviously, the world has dealt with supply chain issues and continues to deal with supply chain issues. All companies have and Boeing is not immune from that. We have had a number of items. Yes, again, this is the latest. Boeing has been proactive. So Boeing was early in working with its suppliers, multiple tiers down to shore up supply chain issues. They\u2019ve been in front of the planning. Obviously, we produce schedules far are in advance. And so modifying those is difficult, close in, it\u2019s difficult on our customers. We\u2019ve been able to work with Boeing on this one too, for the most part, isolate the changes to future schedules. We talked about primarily, this is affecting the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s very helpful compared to something that would affect next month or the month after. So, our work with -- the cooperation with Boeing has been really good. Boeing has been forthcoming and transparent about the impacts and what it\u2019s going to take to correct the issues. Obviously, all of this is difficult. We don\u2019t want interruptions to planned delivery schedules, and we\u2019ll continue to work with Boeing on that as well. But they -- I mean, Boeing is a great partner. The MAX aircraft is a great aircraft. We want our aircraft, but -- they\u2019ve worked very proactively with us on issues we\u2019ve seen before and on this issue as well. Alison Sider : And I guess turning to the sort of the state of near misses or runway incursions the last couple of months across the industry, given that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a real clear single cause or single common denominator in all of these incidents, does that -- what is that -- are there things that you can do or you have been doing to kind of try and address those or prevent future incidents sort of given that they\u2019re not -- they haven\u2019t all been the same? Andrew Watterson : Yes. The aviation and safety has gotten so good that you don\u2019t really see repeat occurrences. And so therefore, the approach the FAA took a while back is to have everyone develop safety management systems. And so that says you will have safety procedures, policies and regulations that you adhere to. So, you maintain safety by being compliant to those rules, regulations and standards. So, our approach then for safety is through compliance. And so we have a safety day actually going on right now, safety week. We\u2019ve got ground operations, we\u2019ll be above the wing and blow the wing next week. And so we continue all the activities outlined in our SMS as our way of making sure that we are safe. We\u2019re also participating in the FAA\u2019s forums. The runway incursion rate looks to be not necessarily up but the close -- severity or potential severity does look to be up. So, it is worthy of attention from the FAA and worthy of intention from us. And so the last thing we want to do as everyone do kind of go off in their own direction. We think it\u2019s best if we follow and participate in the FAA\u2019s lead of how the airspace overall becomes more safe. And so they have a blue-ribbon panel, they\u2019ve just announced to help lead this effort. We will participate with enthusiasm on that and do our part to make this even safer. Operator : The next question will be from Dawn Gilbertson from The Wall Street Journal. Dawn Gilbertson : I think this question is for Ryan. I know you guys are saying as our other airlines are not seeing any signs of demand weakness. But as you\u2019re looking at summer travel bookings so far, do you see anything -- any trends in the bookings that might indicate that people are choosing different destinations since ticket prices are high, hotel prices are high, car rentals and Airbnbs are high. And anything you can share there that maybe some destinations that you\u2019re like, well, why are the bookings so strong there? I\u2019d appreciate any color you might have on that. Thank you. Ryan Green : Yes. Hey Don. I think it\u2019s really what you would expect in terms of where customers want to go this summer. International is -- demand is smoking hot for international destinations. I mean, obviously, we participate in that to a lesser degree than what some of our competitors do. But international is really strong. And then -- it\u2019s really the typical summer destinations that you would expect. Florida -- into the Southwest, Hawaii Mainland, our Hawaii franchise is performing very well. So there\u2019s no real huge surprises in the data when you kind of double-click as to where customers want to go. It\u2019s kind of per normal. Bob Jordan : And there\u2019s -- and the flip of that, there isn\u2019t anything that you\u2019re sticking out as weak. So, I think our customers just want to travel. They want to -- it\u2019s not as strong as \u201822 when you really saw this \u201crevenge travel\u201d come back especially on the leisure side. But the demand is very strong, and it\u2019s strong across the board. Yes. So, I just Ryan Green : Wish I could give you a ... Bob Jordan : Wish I could give you a -- yes, something to hang on to, but we don\u2019t have one, so. Dawn Gilbertson : What about indications? I know that that\u2019s done by another [ph] company, but are you seeing -- is there a shift to vacation packages more or even on your own website? Anything you\u2019ve noticed in the appetite for vacation packages? Ryan Green : Yes. Actually, our vacation business is doing well. And I think that over time, we\u2019ve actually got a lot of opportunity in the vacation space relative to where our network sits and kind of how we participate in that market. Today, we participate in a large part through vacations with travel agencies. And I think over time, there\u2019s an opportunity to do more merchandise vacation packages to the hundreds of millions of customers that are on our digital platforms every day. But back to your original question on kind of are there new patterns in terms of destinations that are emerging from a vacation standpoint, Cancun is very strong. Hawaii is strong. But those are places that customers like to go in the summer. Operator : And the next question is from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Please go ahead. Leslie Josephs : On the moderation of hiring for this year, is that mostly pilots, flight attendants or any other work groups? And do you know by how many jobs you\u2019re going to change your target? And then, just broadly, with your strategy, are you ruling out ever having a differentiated product in the cabin, either like a larger seat or extra legroom or something like that just to drum up revenue in the future? Bob Jordan : Those are two very different questions. So on the hiring, I would just tell you, again, we\u2019re really early in this process with Boeing to understand the impacts specifically, and we pick the 70 in terms of planning or deliveries for 2023, but in terms of understanding exactly where are they -- and then a lot of your hiring again is in advance. So we need to understand what 2024 looks like. I just want to acknowledge today that it\u2019s a significant enough change to the delivery schedule and then therefore, the capacity as well that we are going to go back through our hiring plans, and they will be moderated. I can\u2019t tell you exactly where that is, obviously, because we were highly constrained for the year, and now we\u2019re still likely pilot constrained through, call it, early fourth quarter is my best guess. It\u2019s the group that we probably continue to press to keep the hiring on, at least in the near term here until we flip to aircraft constrained. But no, I don\u2019t have any specifics other than just acknowledging that as the capacity is coming down, we\u2019re going to go back and look at our headcount needs. I mean, it\u2019s prudent to do that. It\u2019s the right thing to do for cost. It\u2019s the right thing to do for efficiency. We\u2019re known for our efficiency, and we\u2019ll go back and do that and we\u2019ll do that quickly. What was your second question? Ryan Green : Premium. Premium revenue. Bob Jordan : Premium. I forgot. My apologies. We are always -- I think we talked about things like assigned seating before. It\u2019s just as an example that we periodically -- we regularly study and survey our customers to understand what\u2019s important to them. What do they want in our products, that includes potential changes -- and so we -- and that we periodically do deeper studies on things like assigned seating. And so far, historically, that\u2019s always told us that our customers love our product. And you\u2019ve seen us -- you have seen us add things now like power and then the larger bins and enhancing the Wi-Fi, and that comes from our customers telling us that\u2019s what they want. Now flipping to, well, what work is underway. I\u2019ll just tell you, there isn\u2019t -- there is no work underway to think about a assigned seating to think about premium in the cabin. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t do that at some point. We are working -- we do work regularly on things like ancillary. So the upgraded boarding product that we -- a few quarters ago, now allow you to buy on the mobile device, and it\u2019s worked really, really well. Those are enhancements that we\u2019re looking at and continue to look at service to our customers. But no, there\u2019s no work underway around premium cabin, assign seating those kinds of things. Our customers love our product. It\u2019s all about being reliable. It\u2019s all about providing terrific service and hospitality. It\u2019s all about putting into place the things that we\u2019ve already committed to, like power, larger bins, enhanced Wi-Fi, continuing to push on digital self-service and then really bring out efficiency here. We\u2019ve grown quickly. We\u2019ve added a lot of people, and we want to work very hard to regain our efficiency, increase margins and ROIC and returns year-over-year and get back, in some cases, to the -- work towards the goals that we laid out at Investor Day, but there\u2019s no work underway in the premium side. Operator : The next question is from Holden Wilen from Dallas Business Journal. Please go ahead. Holden Wilen : I believe it was at Investor Day where you guys said that you\u2019ve added like more than 8,000 new corporate accounts last year. I\u2019m just wondering, as you continue to see the managed business travel recovery in the first quarter, how many more accounts you were able to add during that period? And if you can point to any specific factors as to why you think managed business travel is continuing to recover for you guys. Thanks. Ryan Green : Yes. I think largely, the reason that managed business continues to recover for us is because of the initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place. I think if you look at managed business, travel, sitting here today and kind of where it sits structurally relative to kind of where it\u2019s been historically, there\u2019s a couple of things at play that have reduced managed travel kind of for the industry. The first of those is health scares of traveling. And I think that is well behind us. And I think any tailwinds from that just are unrealistic at this point. And so then the other structural component that I think has kind of depressed managed business travel for the industry, not for us necessarily, but for the industry is some of these -- just the way consumers work today their home versus office patterns versus remote and some of the digital tools. And I think that kind of is what it is at this point. There may be marginal improvements in different parts of the country, but it largely is what it is. And when you look at who -- how that manifests itself is that the unique number of travelers who are traveling for -- in corporate travel or actually, it\u2019s restored to where it was kind of pre-pandemic. What\u2019s down is the frequency of those travelers. And so -- and that is largely -- or I guess, it\u2019s disproportionately impacts global and national accounts. And so we are after backfilling that volume by going out and acquiring new mid-market and small and medium business accounts and back opening up access to new pools of corporate travelers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. I think in March, we had a record number of mid-market accounts active for us. I think if you look at April, we may have another record here in April. And so, we\u2019re going to be after the market share gain. We\u2019re going out to win new accounts, open up access to new pools of travelers. We gained a point of market share in the managed travel space over the last quarter. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be focused going forward, and that\u2019s where the sales team is focused, and our efforts seem to be paying off. Bob Jordan : Well, we put a lot of emphasis on building the team over years now, adding technology like the GDS access. And it\u2019s -- I mean, it will pay off over time. I think as Ryan said, I think that\u2019s the reason you\u2019ve seen us restore or nearly restore ourselves in March here, the pre-pandemic first airline to do that. And Ryan check me, but I think we\u2019ve had 9 of our 10 best managed business booking days in the last two weeks in our history... Ryan Green : Since April. Yes, in the month of April, yes. Bob Jordan : In the month of April. So we\u2019re just -- so you\u2019re seeing that strength is continuing. And I do think it\u2019s because of our investments and winning share. Ryan Green : And we\u2019re focused on removing -- continuing to remove friction and being easier to do business with in the managed travel space. And there\u2019s some trends across the industry where others are making it harder to do business in the managed travel space. And so, I think that you couple that -- couple all of this that we\u2019ve just been talking about with our business-friendly network, business-friendly policies, industry-leading frequent flyer program, I like our chances going forward. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. And we\u2019ll take our last question from David Slotnick from TPG. Please go ahead. David Slotnick : I was just wondering, one of your competitors talked about the current domestic [ph] environment, especially then with added flexibility the airlines have added. They\u2019ve been taking a new look at their overbooking policies where they overbook to what levels that could affect. I wondered if that was something that Southwest is doing as well, especially considering the one to [indiscernible] and if you\u2019ve seen any recognizable patterns of that. Ryan Green : Yes. David, I\u2019m not sure that I caught all of the question there, you were breaking up a bit. But I think the question was others are maybe changing their overbooking policies and kind of what are we doing in that regard. We do not overlook our aircraft. We haven\u2019t overbooked. We have not done any of that since 2017. So, we\u2019re going on 5 or 6 years here of not overbooking. It does happen occasionally when we have to downgauge an aircraft from an aircraft with more seats to fewer seats or for rate-restricted, things like that. We may have an oversell that we have to deal with. But those are few and far between. And so, we\u2019re not -- going forward, we\u2019re not looking at dealing with any sort of materialization rates or any change in the booking curve by changing our overbooking policy. Bob Jordan : We\u2019re going the other way. I mean, we\u2019re adding -- we\u2019re standing firm on the things that our customers want. Yes, we\u2019re not overbooking. It\u2019s a bad experience for our customer. That\u2019s why we stopped it. We\u2019ve added travel credits that never expire just like our growth points that never expires. So yes, we\u2019re leading to the customer here. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thanks, Chad, and we appreciate you all joining us today. If you all have any follow-up questions, you know our communications team is standing by at 214-792-4847 or you can visit our media website at www.swamedia.com. Thanks so much for your time today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am. Julia Landrum : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So, please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : Thanks Julia, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to report a solid quarter with net income of $693 million, excluding special items, and all-time record quarterly revenue of just over $7 billion. The demand environment, especially for leisure travel, continues to be resilient as we have seen solid bookings throughout the busy summer travel season. Further, we continue to expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax profit contribution in full year 2023 for our strategic initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day last December. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect record operating revenue and solid profits in third quarter 2023 and year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. I especially want to thank our people for doing such a fantastic job. They helped us get a record number of customers and a record number of bags on a record number of flights successfully to their destinations, as we experienced the lowest second quarter flight cancellation rate in the past 10 years. It wasn\u2019t without trials. We had a lot going on in the operation related to weather, and weather has continued to be a challenge here in July. Despite that, our employees have continued to deliver a very solid performance. From our network ops control center to the front line, our people have worked together extremely well to minimize cancellations and produce a very reliable operation, and I\u2019m just so proud of them for getting our customers where they need to go, despite a challenging operational environment. While our cost outlook has increased for the year, the change is primarily driven by updates to our market wage rate accruals for open collective bargaining agreements. And while fluid, we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s obviously very hard work and I\u2019m just very appreciative of the dedication of everybody involved in the negotiation process. Now, thinking about where we are with the business, since 2018, we have seen very significant swings due to the grounding of the MAX, demand fall off, of course, from COVID, then the stress from the resurgence of demand, disruptions from post-pandemic supply chain issues, challenges with employee staffing, and most recently, uncertainty with our Boeing aircraft deliveries. The challenges we have faced since 2018 have made planning difficult, so smoothing out fluctuations is a must, and the best way to do that is with smooth and predictable capacity growth. We told you back in April that we were reflowing our order book to allow for orderly and measured growth, and we\u2019re still finalizing the details of that with Boeing, but we remain confident that we will get the 70 deliveries in 2023 that are assumed for our published schedules, and we are working to build a 2024 plan that should be much more stable. We currently are planning to be flying the MAX 7 at some point next year, but if not, we\u2019ll take MAX 8 instead just as we are doing now. Where that leaves us for full year 2023 capacity is unchanged for this year at up 14% to 15% year-over-year. As we shared this morning in our release, we are revamping our 2024 flight schedules. While our network is largely restored at this point, it is not optimized, especially for post-pandemic shifts in business travel. Those adjustments to the network will be largely complete by the March 2024 flight schedules, and we expect those efforts and the continued maturation of development markets to generate an incremental $500 million in pre-tax profit in 2024. The changes will also reduce the percentage of system capacity and development by more than half, returning to normal pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year. We already have our schedule published through March 6, 2024, and currently expect first quarter 2024 capacity to be up in the range of 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Now, keep in mind that nearly 90% of that year-over-year growth is carryover from 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we are planning for a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth in each quarter next year as we work our way back to our long-term goal of mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the first half of 2023, completing several major milestones. We quickly developed and are on track for our winter operations plan. We have the staffing plan in place to fully utilize our fleet by the end of the third quarter and have the network restored by the end of the year. Again, to be clear, it\u2019s restored but not yet optimized, and Ryan will share more on how we\u2019re going to adjust the network based on post-pandemic travel patterns. But we have a lot of exciting things in the works that we believe are going to contribute to our 2024 financial results and help us deliver another year of margin expansion next year. In closing, our accomplishments in 2023 lay a foundation for us to shift our focus to restoring our industry-leading financial and operational performance, boost our operational resilience, and make advances in our industry-leading customer service through a focus on digital hospitality. I just can\u2019t say this enough, I\u2019m just so proud of our people. They are the heart of Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I\u2019d like to extend another thanks to our employees for their commendable efforts this quarter, resulting in solid operational and financial performance, a hard earned improvement from where we began the year. Overall, we had a really solid quarter. Operationally, we had a great completion factor, despite many weather challenges. Financially, bottom line profits were in line with our expectations, despite pressure from market-driven labor accruals. We produced an all-time quarterly operating revenue record. We also generated double-digit operating margins each month during the quarter. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. I just can\u2019t thank them enough. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance. So, I will jump right to cost, fleet and then balance sheet. Beginning with fuel, our second quarter jet fuel price was $2.60 per gallon, slightly above our previous guidance. Throughout second quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, hovering for the most part around $80 per barrel. We are 49% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be similar to our second quarter fuel price. And that includes an estimated $0.08 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon range, including $0.09 of hedging gains. This is up a dime from our previous guidance due to higher refining margins. Of course, market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We are currently 54% hedged in 2024, and over the last few months, we\u2019ve added meaningfully to our 2025 portfolio and began building our 2026 portfolio. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for third quarter through 2026 is $373 million. We will continue to see seek cost effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to non-fuel cost, our second quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 7.5% was towards the unfavorable end of our guidance range due to incremental adjustments to market wage rate accruals for our open labor agreements. We have said this from the beginning, but our labor accruals are based on market, and in this environment market has obviously been dynamic. We are planning and eager to award our work groups with well-deserved compensation increases. Looking ahead, our nominal third quarter cost trends remain fairly consistent with second quarter. We currently estimate our third quarter CASM-X to increase in the 3.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This increase is again largely driven by higher labor costs. We are also continuing to incur additional maintenance expense relative to 2022 for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance, adding further pressure to our second half cost inflation. For our full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 1% to 2% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 2% to 4%. The estimated 0.5 increase is due primarily to higher labor cost pressures as I\u2019ve already covered. Turning to our fleet, during second quarter, we received a total of 21 aircraft deliveries and retired 11 -700 aircraft, ending the quarter with over 800 aircraft. We are working to reflow our order book with Boeing. However, for this year, we continue to plan for approximately 70 -8 deliveries and 26 -700 retirements, which takes the fleet to 814 aircraft at year-end. Likewise, our CapEx outlook remains unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion, which assumes approximately $2.3 billion in aircraft capital spend. Our 2023 capacity guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14% to 15% year-over-year, and we have tightened our third quarter capacity guidance to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, we are planning for first quarter 2024 capacity to grow 14% to 16% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind, we are growing 14% to 15% in 2023, and that alone drives nearly 90% of that first quarter year-over-year growth. So, the primary driver of that first quarter year-over-year growth is annualizing the additional capacity we are adding this year. But, our long-term goal remains mid-single-digit year-over-year growth. Lastly, our balance sheet remains pristine and we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.2 billion, net of $67 million in debt repayments for the first half of the year. We continue to be in a net cash position and expect a modest $16 million in scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year. And currently, 2023 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We declared another dividend in second quarter which was paid just a couple of weeks ago. I am proud of what we have accomplished through the first half of the year. That said, we still have work to do to return to industry-leading financial performance, which is our priority as we work on our plans for next year. This includes managing the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, reflowing our order book with Boeing to support orderly, measured and profitable growth, and rebalancing and optimizing our network. We believe these plans, combined with our existing initiatives and the maturation of our development markets will help us expand both margins and return on invested capital in 2024 as compared with this year. Let me close by saying my confidence in our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals is anchored by my belief in the people of Southwest Airlines and their ability to create and inspire success. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Ryan Green : Thanks, Tammy. I\u2019ll walk you through our second quarter revenue results, provide context for our third quarter outlook and update you on some of our commercial priorities. And for additional detail on our revenue performance, I\u2019ll point you to this morning\u2019s earnings release. Starting with second quarter, demand continues to be resilient, especially for leisure travel. Overall trends have remained steady with operating revenue for the first half of 2023, consistently well above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Operating revenue for second quarter was an all-time quarterly record of just over $7 billion. And in fact, we had record operating revenue in every month of the quarter. Second quarter 2023 unit revenue or RASM decreased 8.3% on a year-over-year basis on a capacity increase of 14.1%. And while it\u2019s a year-over-year decline, it\u2019s still our second highest second quarter RASM to date, which points to the tough comp we were up against from last year. And as a reminder, year-over-year RASM was impacted by a 5-point headwind from approximately $300 million of higher-than-normal breakage revenue that was recognized in the second quarter of 2022, resulting from flight credits issued during the pandemic that were set to expire prior to our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Overall, second quarter revenue came in at the favorable end of our expectations as close-in leisure held strong. Second quarter revenue from corporate travel came in largely as expected, as we realized sequential and year-over-year improvement in managed business revenue. And while travelers from some of our largest segments have reduced their frequency of their business trips from pre-pandemic levels, we\u2019re very pleased with the gains we continue to make in the managed business space. Small and medium businesses, government and educations are strong points for us, and we are growing the number of accounts we have under contract. All of this has allowed us to continue to grow our share of the managed business travel. We gained additional passenger market share in the second quarter and exited the quarter seeing more unique travelers flying for business than we saw pre-pandemic. Moving to the third quarter, we\u2019re seeing leisure booking and yield strength continue throughout the summer travel season with July revenue, which is essentially booked, expected to also be a record. Of course, much of the post Labor Day booking curve comes in closer but we\u2019re very encouraged by the response to our June fare sale for off-peak fall travel and what that suggests for continued leisure demand. We had all-time record bookings the week of our fare sale with three booking days that were top 10 all-time records and included our record day for the most bookings ever taken. In fact, we have more passengers booked for third quarter travel at this point in the curve than we did at the same point in time for second quarter. Of course, on a revenue basis, nominal yields are typically weaker sequentially third quarter versus second quarter but the strength in passengers points to the continued demand for Southwest Airlines. We currently expect overall corporate travel to have a modest underlying trend improvement, and we expect to continue our gains in industry market share. Overall, however, we expect corporate travel demand will remain lower than leisure for the foreseeable future, particularly compared with pre-pandemic. So with a higher leisure mix, and as the number of business trips taken per traveler remain down for our most frequent customers, it gives us an opportunity to look at our current network design. Pre-pandemic, those travelers had a skew of short-haul travel with more frequent trips and also more midweek travel, and our current network is designed assuming those travel patterns would return. Moving forward, there is a revenue opportunity to adjust the network to adapt to the new travel patterns we expect to continue to see from our mix of business and leisure customers. Ultimately, this leaves us with third quarter unit revenue expected to be down 3% to 7% year-over-year on capacity up roughly 12% again on a year-over-year basis. The decline in year-over-year unit revenue is driven by capacity growing faster than seasonably typical as we restore the network and normalize the utilization of our fleet as well as tough prior year comparisons from the post-pandemic domestic demand surge. So, while there is still room to optimize our unit revenue efficiency, this guide implies a third quarter record for operating revenue. So again, we are in the process of adjusting our network to support our imperative of industry-leading financial performance. Starting with the January 2024 schedules, we\u2019ve made changes to the composition of the network such that it supports the customer travel behavior changes I just mentioned. We made changes that reflect where our customers are traveling and when they\u2019re traveling, including time of day and day of week, and this optimization will be largely complete in spring of 2024. In addition, we have more than 10% of our markets under development, which will normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels over the next 12 to 18 months. So, as we said in the release and as Bob mentioned earlier, the go-forward revenue opportunity from the network is substantial. And of course, we also expect continued revenue contribution growth from our existing and fully implemented revenue initiatives. Finally, we have always worked hard to consistently deliver the best hospitality and customer service here at Southwest. Our customer service is, of course, legendary, and our customer policies are industry-leading. And we are on track in deploying our onboard product initiatives, including Wi-Fi upgrades, larger overhead bins and in-seat power. We are now focused on widening our customer service advantage through prioritizations of a series of initiatives that will improve our digital hospitality and allow our customers to serve themselves in most cases. We aren\u2019t ready to provide you all the details there, but the initiatives will help us achieve our goal to deliver the best and most efficient hospitality with next-generation tools, airport layouts and more. And now, with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m going to provide some additional details on our operational performance and a brief update on our Winter Operations Preparedness Plan. Well, I\u2019ll just start by commending our employees for their warrior spirits and the solid operational performance they delivered in an operationally challenging quarter. As Bob mentioned, we had record flight activity, record customers and record bag counts. But we were ready. We were staffed up and we were prepared. Our completion factor in the second quarter was really pretty remarkable. We reliably achieved a flight completion factor of more than 99% in the second quarter. It was the highest second quarter performance in the past 10 years. And that is despite the challenging environment. June, in particular, had tough operating conditions. We had issues across the entire system with pretty much continuous weather disruptions. Safety is always our first priority, so we couldn\u2019t avoid some flight delays, but we are really excelled in getting customers to the destinations and with their bags. And when we had weather events, we managed to reset and be right back on track the next morning, which is a sign of good management through the regular operations by our people. Underneath that headline, we saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics as on-time performance, long delays, early morning originators, turn compliance, flown as booked and trip Net Promoter Score, all showed solid year-over-year improvements. This was against the backdrop of runway closures in Las Vegas and Denver, which are two of our largest operations. Another drag was our block time hit rate, which dropped over 4 points relative to the second quarter last year as our pilots had to take more circuitous routing because of weather. The broad-based improved performance against these headwinds is a testament to solid execution by our people. Looking forward, we\u2019re also really pleased with our progress on the implementation of our Winter Preparedness Plan. Just a reminder, though the plan is detailed on a micro site, which is available on our website. The plan is on track to be fully implemented in fourth quarter 2023 in advance of our winter storm season. I won\u2019t walk you through all the details today since it\u2019s on the micro site. But I will say that everything is going really well, and we are already accepting delivery of new equipment and infrastructure as well as completing software implementations. We are conducting summer school to trade new ramp agents on deicing and train all ramp agents on new equipment. Obviously, the other thing we have going on is labor negotiations, where we continue to work diligently, and we continue to make progress. I do want to thank all the parties of both sides who work hard to negotiate these collective bargain agreements. I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019ve been able to get so many ratified in the last 9 months, but we still have more to do with a couple that have been amenable for a while. We know the negotiations could be emotional as well as complicated, but we are committed to good faith negotiations to get new agreements in place as quickly as possible and to compensate our employees with market wage rates. So, in closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. It\u2019s an honor to be part of this team and to have the opportunity to support them. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions, so a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. So, wondering if you have any color on the pressure on load factors in the quarter? And then, guiding to a lot of pressure on RASM in Q3 as capacity accelerates. With Q4 capacity expected to accelerate further, do you think we should expect further RASM pressure? And given that, do you think about maybe moderating some of the capacity growth? Ryan Green : Yes. Hey Scott, it\u2019s Ryan. I think just stepping back and just taking a look at the second quarter overall, I think it was a really good performance, record operating revenue for the quarter, record operating revenue for each of the months in the quarter. And I think when you think about that relative to the compare period from the prior year, with the pent-up demand in second quarter plus the headwind that we were facing there on the breakage adjustment of about 5 points, which, by the way, does not persist going forward. That is -- that comparison is isolated to the second quarter there. I think that the performance is really, really good. The fare environment, second quarter year-over-year, if you adjust because that breakage benefit or breakage comparison from second quarter of 2022 gets booked into passenger revenue, that gets spread out over all the revenue there in the quarter. And if you isolate that, average fares in the second quarter are actually up year-over-year at 2%. So, we\u2019re in an environment here where we\u2019re managing -- we\u2019re optimizing revenue in a really strong fare environment, which does typically have a little bit of pressure on loads. And the -- and I think if you look at our domestic load factor compare second quarter, it\u2019s in line with the compares -- or the load factor performance that our competitors saw in the second quarter as well. So, all of that taken into account on the second -- on the second quarter, I feel really good about that. As you think about the fare environment going forward, July here is almost booked. I think the fare environment as far as we can tell, continues to persist. Here in July, I think, we expect another record revenue in July, again, on a tough compare from prior periods with the pent-up demand last year. So, I think we\u2019re just in an environment here where we are managing -- where we\u2019re optimizing revenue in a very strong fare environment, and that typically comes with a couple of points of load factor adjustment there. Bob Jordan : Scott, it\u2019s Bob. The other thing we -- obviously, the new -- we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019re in this new revenue management system as well that we\u2019re -- I think will be fully taken over the network in terms of pricing this fall. And number one, I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve been able to get it in. We got it in on time, but it thinks about your whole itinerary. And one of the things that happens, too, is it maximizes close-in demand. So, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise doing that that you might see a little bit of a lower load here, especially as we learn the new system, and again, all that was known as we did testing. Second thing is we know we\u2019re in a suboptimal environment. We brought capacity back quickly as we restored our flying. I\u2019m very proud of the team here. We will get all of our aircraft in the air and be unconstrained flying everything here at the end of the third quarter, which is actually ahead of our plan, but it\u2019s not optimized. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing all the work in the first quarter of next year around the network to optimize. The last thing, just Ryan talked about this, as you associate this to average fare, we have a large percent of our network in development. It\u2019s over 10%. We added new cities. We grew Hawaii during the pandemic. We put kind of 100 aircraft or more into those investments, and those are still in development, and that will mature across 2024. And I expect that percent of our total system in development to be normal to fall across each quarter next year and to be normal sort of pre-pandemic normal by the end of next year. And I think, Tammy, if you just think about fares, the average fair drag from that sort of those excessive development markets compared to normal is about $2 right now. So, it just gives you a ballpark in terms of thinking about average fare as well. Scott Group : Helpful. So, I guess, just a quick follow-up, like to that. The network optimization, is that more of a cost opportunity or revenue opportunity? I guess, ultimately, I\u2019m trying to figure out like if capacity is up high single next year, do we think CASM is up or down next year? Bob Jordan : Do you want to take that, Tammy? Tammy Romo : Yes. We\u2019ll tag team on that. No, we believe that the network redesign, it will be beneficial to both our revenues as well as on the cost side. And as we look ahead to next year, we are absolutely committed to driving our unit cost down. And certainly, the network and our opportunities there to align our staffing and our fleet to our network -- our network design should be helpful in helping us to achieve that goal. Bob Jordan : Yes. And I think I would just add, too, you talked about the large capacity in the first quarter that we\u2019ve just talked about, 14 to 16. It\u2019s still capacity. But just as a reminder, with the restoration -- getting all the aircraft flying this year, it\u2019s going to produce a lot of capacity just doing that because we were so constrained, particularly on the pilot side, which again goes away in the third quarter. So, it produces a lot of carryover, especially into early next year. So 90% of that growth in the first quarter is simply carryover from adds back here in 2023. As you think about the network optimization, yes, as Tammy said, it\u2019s a play on both sides. But the travel patterns -- it\u2019s clear, the travel patterns post-pandemic are not what they were pre-pandemic. Some of that is leisure, a lot of that is that business. I expect business to continue to come back, but I think it\u2019s going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while. So, Ryan talked about this, but it\u2019s things like a much more aggressive reduction into -- on a Tuesday and a Wednesday for example. Normally, that schedule would fall about 2 points from a Monday. I think it\u2019s going to fall about 8 points with the optimization of the network. We\u2019re managing much, much better management of really early and really late flights, which obviously have RASM penalties on those. So anyways, it\u2019s definitely a revenue play, but it\u2019s really meant to just match the post-pandemic demand and travel patterns to what we\u2019re seeing to the network. Andrew Watterson : Yes. To give some color on this, it\u2019s kind of put in the 4 buckets, the network changes we\u2019re doing. The first is a frequency shift from mostly short-haul business heavy routes to more medium and long-haul routes with a lower business mix. The second is Tuesday, Wednesday reductions, are down 7% to 10% versus Monday, Thursday, Friday, depending on the season. The third is the shoulder of the day. So moving the latest and earliest flights, which are typically our worst performers a little bit in. And then the fourth is we\u2019re adjusting the new city in Hawaii markets, as we\u2019ve understood their seasonality and demand patterns, we will be shifting them as a result. Now to give you some -- a little bit of color on that first one about how we\u2019re shifting the frequencies, let\u2019s take Midway. In March of \u201824, we\u2019ll have 225 departures. In March of this year, we had 229, so, just down 4 trips. Underneath that, you have 26 city pairs that are changing frequencies. You say Midway to Columbus, down 2 frequencies from 6x to 4x, Midway to Phoenix up 2 frequencies and replace it. And then same thing in Columbus, they\u2019re not losing 2 frequencies. Those frequencies are going from Midway to Sarasota and the Tampa. And so, everyone kept their departure, so to speak, so the composition moved a little bit. Now Sarasota is a pure-play leisure, but Tampa and Phoenix is a combination of leisure and business. So, it\u2019s kind of a mix shift at the margin, not like going together guardrail, so to speak. So all these -- you go do this through all of our network, it leads up to a substantial change, but each one itself is modest. Operator : Our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Good afternoon. Can I ask maybe a high-level question kind of tying in all the different things that you\u2019re working on? And when do you think you can get back to 2019 level of profitability, not necessarily EPS, but just kind of pretax income type level? Like, what does it take to get there and how long does it take to get there? Tammy Romo : Yes. Hi Savi. We are in the midst of working on our detailed 2024 plan and certainly getting back to pre-pandemic levels of profitability is our goal. And as we\u2019ve shared with you, adjusting our network to the current demand environment and current business environment is a part, a significant part of that plan. We\u2019re not ready, obviously, to provide guidance for next year, but certainly getting back to those levels of profitability is the goal. So, the first order of priority is to fly all of our fleet and optimize our staffing levels to that flying and to the network adjustments that we\u2019ve taken you through. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve got ongoing contributions from our initiatives as we continue to grow the network. And certainly, we\u2019ll continue to get contributions from our ongoing fleet modernization plans. So, we\u2019ve -- certainly a lot of moving parts here as we work to rebuild following the pandemic. It\u2019s obviously been a little messy here. But the good news is that we are almost fully restored and will be soon, and we will be certainly pivoting and putting our efforts on producing year-over-year margin expansion for 2024. Savi Syth : That\u2019s helpful. And I was just wondering if I could ask a question on the labor accruals. Does that include what has historically been part of the kind of the ratification bonuses? So, in your case, anything kind of prior to April 2022 or any catch-up to kind of last year\u2019s where you might be lower? Is that also included in kind of this year\u2019s labor accrual, or is it just getting kind of the labor cost to what you think the market rates are? Tammy Romo : Savi, it is our best attempt to adjust our market rates to current market rates. And obviously, there\u2019s been changes as we\u2019ve been moving along here, and we\u2019ve been adjusting as we go. And certainly, for the third quarter, we have factored all of that into our third quarter cost guidance, as best we can estimate. So -- and I think that\u2019s an important point, Savi. So, we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve been accruing all along, as you know here -- as you know. And so, just keep that in mind as you compare Southwest to maybe some of the other guys in the industry. Bob Jordan : Yes. I mean just in short, though, yes, we are fully accrued for what is the most recent market. And as you know, market\u2019s been moving. In fact, the change that we made for full year cost down 2% to 4%, we guided down 1% to 2%. That change was basically entirely updating our accruals across the quarter because the market moved. Savi Syth : And that\u2019s pilots and that\u2019s all labor groups\u2026? Bob Jordan : It\u2019s all. Savi Syth : And I mean the driver of that increase, was it kind of all labor groups driving it up or this quarter more because of pilot -- you\u2019ve seen some pilot\u2026 Bob Jordan : It\u2019s anywhere we saw an increase on -- so if you have an open contract that we\u2019re still in negotiations, it\u2019s anywhere where the market moved, we updated our accruals. So, in my mind, we are fully accrued to the market. And just -- I mean, just on that note, just a little side, we just had some good news this morning. We had -- we got a notice that we have ratification of a new agreement with our mechanics and related employees in AMFA. So, they just ratified contract extension four years through 2027 this morning. So, a little bit of good news there, another one. So, I think that makes 7 in the last 9 months, so. Operator : Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just on the -- I mean, you noted some of the reasons that you need to kind of tweak the network. But could you comment on maybe geographically, and I don\u2019t know how you look at it internally, maybe Hawaii, Midwest, West Coast, East Coast, how much variation is there across the U.S. as we think about that third quarter guidance, what is stronger versus what is weaker? And then, just on the network changes broadly, why start in January? If you\u2019ve identified changes that need to happen, why not start in September or the fourth quarter? What are the practical reasons not to do that? Ryan Green : Yes. Hey Duane, it\u2019s Ryan. Just on the geographic elements and kind of what\u2019s stronger versus what are we seeing that\u2019s weaker. The Hawaii franchise itself, now that is -- that\u2019s part of our markets that are under development. And so there is the development element of that, but we\u2019ve been very pleased with the Hawaii franchise overall, especially the main lands of Hawaii, element of that franchise. Load factors are very high. Yields are improving. So we\u2019re very, very happy with how Hawaii is performing. To your comments on why -- network changes, we have made some changes to the network in Intra-Cal and that intra-Cal itself, despite the West Coast being a little bit slower to come back in the recovery, Intra-Cal itself is performing well. Leisure-based markets, Florida is performing well, just typically strong leisure markets in this environment continue to perform very well for us in the strong leisure environment. So that kind of gives you a flavor for what\u2019s going well. The opportunities, we -- there are markets as we brought back the network and restored the network, there are different geographies that have different levels of capacity kind of as we bring those cities back. And obviously, you have to work to absorb the capacity as it comes into the market. So, we\u2019re working on those markets where there\u2019s kind of been outsized capacity growth, and we\u2019ll continue to focus there. But, one of the things that Southwest Airlines benefits from is we have largely a relatively diverse domestic footprint. And as different parts of the country respond differently and have go through different economic cycles, we\u2019re able to kind of weather that a little bit better maybe than some of our peers. So, that\u2019s an inherent advantage for us as we go forward. Duane Pfennigwerth : I mean -- go ahead. Andrew Watterson : I\u2019m sorry. Duane, it\u2019s Andrew. I\u2019d also add that we want to -- when you make change to your network, you want to kind of understand before you make fulsome changes. So, we have been making adjustments. So, in September as the first schedule we have on modified Tuesday, Wednesday capacity versus Monday, Thursday, Friday, so we -- it\u2019s not as aggressive as we have started in January. So we want to have that out there and see how -- both to understand that before we started making changes and then some of the network changes that we\u2019re doing, we also stepped into them over the course of September through fourth quarter. We like what we saw on the forward bookings and so we made the kind of full adjustment starting in Q1. So, it\u2019s essentially done by March, except for the seasonality type adjustments I talked about will obviously happen as that season rolls around. Bob Jordan : Well, Duane, also if you think about just more for our customers, just the example of the change on the Tuesday, Wednesday moving to an 8% reduction from a typical Monday, changing schedules that are already published, especially for the holidays, it\u2019s super disruptive to our customers. And so, if you\u2019re going to go in there and make wholesale changes to the fall, we\u2019re committed to not doing that. Obviously, we tweak our schedules now and then. But in terms of wholesale changes, we committed coming out of the pandemic to not do that to our customers. So January really -- obviously, we did some things, as Andrew described, but January was really the first opportunity in a new published schedule to enact a lot of the changes. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, great. And then just for my follow-up, I wonder if you\u2019d be willing to kind of quantify the excess training investment and I think the reliability investment, which I guess is actually bigger, you would know. But, can you give us a sense for the magnitude of those that are unlikely to kind of reoccur or maybe wind down next year? Tammy Romo : Hey Duane, I\u2019ll take that. In terms of the training, we\u2019ll provide more details once we have our plan fully baked here and solidify our capacity plans, et cetera. But I can help you with regard to costs that we\u2019ve incurred this year that we believe are onetime related to the ops disruptions, and that\u2019s about $100 million to $150 million. So, that\u2019s kind of onetime comp that won\u2019t repeat next year. Beyond that, we\u2019ll share additional details once we lay out our 2024 plan for you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : First question is of a modeling variety. So, Tammy, if we look at the third quarter X fuel CASM guide and then the full year guide of down 1% to 2%. And I realize there\u2019s some wiggle room here, but it implies a fourth quarter outcome that\u2019s pretty similar to the third quarter in terms of absolute X fuel CASM at least closer than what\u2019s usually the sequential case. Fourth quarter is usually higher than third quarter. Just wondering how you\u2019d address that. Tammy Romo : Well, keep in mind, Jamie, that capacity is going to be a factor in that as we continue to add back capacity. So, I think that\u2019s the primary driver. Jamie Baker : Okay. And then, second, and this sort of builds off what I asked you about last quarter. You mentioned the stagnant corporate demand, revamping schedules next year to reflect post-pandemic changes to how customers are flying. And I don\u2019t dispute that those changes have taken place. Other airlines have spoken to this. I\u2019m just curious, how do you separate changes in travel patterns from the possibility that maybe the Southwest brand was somewhat damaged last December. I mean, you make it sound like it\u2019s all the fault of shifting consumer preference and it may very well be but have you at least consider that maybe something about the overall value proposition of Southwest might also be a contributing factor? Bob Jordan : Yes. I\u2019ll let Ryan talk to the specifics, as you think about markets and trying to tease that apart. But I\u2019ll just start at the top, and you mentioned a lot of this early on. I mean, we are just -- obviously, we track customer trust and all those things, preferences and they\u2019re all heading in the right direction and look really good. To me, the top line factor is just thinking about demand for the brand and is there any hangover effect. I mean, we had tremendous strength in the quarter. We had, again, record operating revenues, record passengers, record flights, all those things. We had our fall sale, and I believe each of those days was a record in terms of our highest booking day in our history. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about, Ryan can talk more about demand on the business side. We\u2019re seeing, I would say, significant market share gains in terms of our piece of the business. We talked about that at Investor Day in December. And since that time, we\u2019re seeing really meaningful shifts in market share our way on the business side. So, as you think about demand for the brand, demand for the product that shows up, obviously, in bookings, we\u2019re just not seeing any sign of weakness. Ryan? Ryan Green : Yes. No, like I think we mentioned last quarter, of course, following the event, we have brand tracking research in place where we\u2019re tracking sentiment on a weekly basis. Those scores in terms of trust in Southwest Airlines, their confidence in our ability to get them where they want to go, all of those have rebounded past -- post disruption. And I would say we\u2019re -- those are back to normal ranges, certainly. I\u2019d echo what Bob said, the biggest single indicator is demand for Southwest Airlines overall. I think as you look forward to the third quarter, expecting another record revenue in third quarter just came off a record revenue performance in second quarter. We had record Rapid Reward acquisitions in the second quarter, record co-brand spend, which is an indication of customer engagement in the second quarter. So, I think, all of that points to the fact that there is continued strong demand for Southwest Airlines, and the disruption is in our past. I will also just point to the fact the travel patterns changing. If you look at an individual customer basis and you look at the frequency of their travel, especially for business trips, that began to plateau prior to last December. So, there\u2019s been no step down in terms of frequency of travel on Southwest Airlines post disruption event. Those trends were beginning to emerge last year and prior to the event overall. Now, on the whole, as Bob mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to pick up market share in the managed business space. So, we\u2019re winning more business and we\u2019re winning -- we\u2019re earning the business of incremental passengers. So, we\u2019re going out and adding more accounts under contract. We\u2019re winning more of their business as we move forward. It\u2019s just the structural impact of the pandemic on the frequency of business trips on an individual traveler again persists or that was taking place prior to the disruption in December. Operator : Our next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : 10 years ago, you guys established a plan that was centered around minimal capacity growth until your return on invested capital hit like 15%. During that time frame, slow growth, your earnings exploded. I realize today is not exactly the same. You have a large order book, open labor contracts, all that stuff. But you do have a lot of planes that you could retire. I\u2019m just trying to understand why you\u2019re not taking a step back and slowing capacity into \u201824, accelerating your fleet plan? Like, why is mid-single-digit growth the right number for Southwest right now? Thank you. Tammy Romo : I\u2019ll start. And -- well, first of all, we do believe we have growth opportunities. And I\u2019ll just remind you again that we did make investments during the pandemic to grow our route network. And as we reported, we have a larger than normal amount of our capacity in development markets. But those are progressing and they\u2019re trending in line, if not higher than our expectations. So, we\u2019re pleased with that growth. And based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, we have no plans to pull back on the development of those markets because we believe those are really good markets for Southwest over the long term. And we believe we have additional opportunities in our strong hold market. So, now, that said, based on our assessment of our growth opportunities, we believe that supports mid-single-digit ASM growth. Now, as always, and I remember that plan very well, at the end of the day, we are determined to drive the returns on invested capital that we can all be very proud of. And as always, one of the wonderful things about Southwest Airlines as we build our plans with ample opportunity. So to your point, we have a flexible order book and flexible fleet plans. And you\u2019re exactly right. If we -- if we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t have -- we\u2019ve given you our plans, but should we need to adjust, we\u2019ve got the levers that we could we could do so. But, at this point, based on everything that we\u2019ve seen, we believe with these network changes that we can drive the revenue performance next year that we all desire. So, a lot of moving parts here, and we\u2019re busy at work on our 2024 plan. But again, as we look ahead to next year, we are very focused on delivering a 2024 plan that will deliver margin expansion and as well as expansion and return on invested capital. Bob Jordan : Conor, you\u2019re just in a period here where we\u2019re not optimized, too. I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we got all the aircraft open flying here in the third quarter, and we\u2019ll have our network restored by the end of the year. But again, it doesn\u2019t mean optimal. And it\u2019s not just the network. It\u2019s not optimal in terms of how we think about our resource, usage and our efficiency. And so we\u2019ll attack that very aggressively, just like we\u2019re attacking the network here in the first quarter of 2024. Past that, to me, the biggest question would be, do you have opportunities for the aircraft that we\u2019re talking about, the mid-single-digit growth supporting. And we have significant opportunities in just name a place, Denver and Austin and Nashville and on and on and on, where there\u2019s huge demand for the Southwest product. We have gates coming on line. I would be worried if you\u2019re sitting here going, I don\u2019t know where to put the next aircraft. That\u2019s not the case. We have tremendous demand for the brand. We have tremendous demand in our focus cities, in our large cities and others and a lot of brand strength here. And again, yes, absolutely, there\u2019s work to do to optimize the airline, wring out cost, continue to boost revenues to things like the network actions and then obviously boost our returns. And as Tammy said, we have a lot of flexibility. Conor Cunningham : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just to put a finer point on 2024 or as we just think about what you\u2019ve added so far, the implications for \u201824. If you just pull fourth quarter capacity through \u201824, I think it\u2019s -- the implied capacity growth is like 6% year-over-year. So, is that the low watermark that we should expect next year? I\u2019m just -- again, just trying to understand the context of this measured and orderly and all these other moving parts you have that\u2019s going on with your number right now. Thank you. Tammy Romo : So, the impact of just the carryover to next year is probably, I would say, 7 points. Bob Jordan : Yes. Operator : We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may now go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Thank you, everyone. So just lots of moving pieces on RASM and obviously a very hot topic. As we look out to 2024, you gave us a lot of moving pieces. How do we think about earnings growth for 2024, given you have $500 million benefit from network optimization, but RASM, it will be down most likely and CASM-X could be up. So, is there a possibility for flat earnings or revenue -- EBIT growth next year? Bob Jordan : Well, Sheila, obviously we have the -- as we talked about at the Investor Day, we\u2019ve got the contribution from our initiatives that we described there, which is $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT. You got on top of that. The $500 million that we\u2019ve described in the value of the network changes that occurred during the first quarter and are in place again by March, we have some other things that we\u2019re talking about here relative to opportunities. So, all that is obviously a desire to lead you to margin expansion again here in 2024. But, we\u2019re working on our plan. We don\u2019t have a plan to share with you yet. That\u2019s coming later, obviously, in the fall. But yes, margin expansion is absolutely the goal. Tammy, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything? Tammy Romo : I think you covered it. Julia Landrum : Okay. That concludes the analyst portion of our call. I appreciate everyone joining. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Anthony, and welcome to the members of our media on our call today. We\u2019ll go ahead and get started with our media Q&A. So Anthony, if you would queue folks up to begin asking questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] You may now go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi everyone. Thank you so much for the time today. I wanted to revisit the conversation earlier about the pilot contract, because obviously, we saw United come out with their tentative agreement, and that ultimately brought American back to the negotiating table to try and meet those pay standards and benefits. Wanted to ask if there\u2019s an update there and if Southwest is committed to kind of meeting those new pay standards and benefits and where you all are at with that. Bob Jordan : Thanks for the question, Andrew, you can chime in, too. So obviously, we are -- negotiations are complex. We are eager to reach agreements with all of our groups that have opened contracts right now. We\u2019re meeting very regularly with SWAPA and very hopeful for progress there, but nothing new to report. You\u2019ve heard about the strike authorization vote. Obviously, that is a NMB defined process, mediation is a defined process. So, it\u2019s -- I\u2019d say there is no strike or an imminent strike. There are a lot of steps that would lead up to that. And obviously, we want to make progress well ahead of any of those, but there\u2019s no threat of an imminent strike or anything like that. There are many, many steps that would have to occur first. No, we have a desire to get all of our contracts closed up, obviously, including that with our pilots to get them taken care of. They do a fantastic job, and we certainly want progress there. Andrew Watterson : I\u2019d say that if you look -- it\u2019s a strong pilots market. So it\u2019s a great time to be a pilot. And you see that reflected in the wage rates, which often gets the headlines. But I think what\u2019s characterized by all the agreements I\u2019ve seen so far is it\u2019s not so much so wage rates. It\u2019s the other the non-wage portions or the scheduling rules and such, which increases the quality of life for the pilots, can also increase costs for the company. And so those rules can be complex and difficult. So, you spend lots of time then to go through it. Wage rates is defined -- is a defined matter, you know that, but the scheduling rules and implications take longer to write out and to model out and agree upon it. So in my opinion, that\u2019s what makes the timeline longer than you would like with regards to our current negotiations. Operator : Our next question will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I just wanted to clarify, when will you have everything under your winter plan, everything that was planned as a result of the disruption, when will you have all of that in place? And the $100 million to $150 million cost you mentioned earlier, that was for everything post disruption. Is that right? Andrew Watterson : I\u2019ll handle the timeline. So we have -- October is the deadline we\u2019ve given ourselves to get everything ready. We expect winter storms to actually be after that, but our internal deadline is October. And so that will be when we report our third quarter earnings, it will be later in October, and we\u2019ll make sure to go through and have a comprehensive review and status update where we are on that. But so far, things are on track, and we\u2019re taking delivery and encouraged by the results. Tammy Romo : Yes. And Mary, your question on the $100 million to $150 million, would you mind repeating that? Mary Schlangenstein : Yes. I was asking if that\u2019s the cost for everything that you\u2019ve put in place as a result of the disruptions or if that was just related earlier to the mention of additional training costs for ramp workers. Tammy Romo : No, it didn\u2019t. It\u2019s our best estimate right now of what our onetime cost, there may -- some of those costs that we -- some of the investments that we made this year may prove to be somewhat sticky into next year, including some of our in some of our technology investments. But -- so that\u2019s just our best guess of what the onetime costs are. Bob Jordan : And Tammy, I think it also includes things like we did gratitude pay. And we did -- we had some incremental customer reimbursements this year and things like that that are really a onetime related to the disruption that don\u2019t show up again in \u201824. Tammy Romo : Mary, just one more thing, just -- I just want to remind you that we -- even before the event, we had -- we had plans to modernize our operations. So, those are some of the investments that I was referring to earlier. Those were already in place and obviously, those will continue and all that\u2019s been contemplated in our guidance. Operator : Our next question will come from Dawn Gilbertson with The Wall Street Journal. Dawn Gilbertson : A quick question here. Your competitors for more than a year now have been talking over and over again about how the leisure travel surge has everybody paying up for premium seats and so forth. You guys don\u2019t have anything really to upsell to. But I\u2019m curious, how has this manifested itself, if it has, at Southwest? I mean, can you share any details on demand for upgraded boarding, EarlyBird boarding, even leisure travel purchase of Business Select? Thanks. And one related question to that. I noticed a lot of -- you\u2019re making a lot of pitches now to buy A-List status. I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t recall that in the past. So, I\u2019m curious about the strategy there, too. Thank you. Ryan Green : Hey Dawn, it\u2019s Ryan. Good to talk to you. Yes, you\u2019re right. Some of our competitors for a while now have been talking about premium revenue and that being a tailwind to their RASM performance. And I think that it probably has a material impact on their RASM performance that our business model just we don\u2019t participate in that premium revenue stream to any of the same degree that they do. However, having said that, our ancillary revenue in the second quarter as an example was a record. It was a very good quarter for EarlyBird. EarlyBird had been lagging a little bit through the pandemic recovery, but EarlyBird, it performed very well in the second quarter. Upgraded boarding, we added the ability in the third quarter of last year to purchase upgraded boarding on digital -- on your mobile device. Take rates have tripled since that point. And so, we\u2019ve had very strong upgraded boarding revenue over the course of the last year. And we\u2019ve been able to maintain the price and grow the price actually some on upgraded boarding and EarlyBird as well. So, ancillary revenue is definitely a high point for us in the quarter. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t participate at the same level from a premium revenue standpoint as some of our competitors do. Related to your last question on the ability to buy A-List status, we have historically -- we run campaigns, we call those tier qualifying points, the ability to kind of top off -- pay a little bit and top off your tier qualifying points to get to A-List, A-List Preferred. That\u2019s nothing new. We\u2019ve recently run some of those campaigns, but we\u2019ve done those historically in the past as well. Dawn Gilbertson : Can you -- one follow-up. Can you give any -- it\u2019s been years, I think, since you guys have put any dollar figures on EarlyBird revenue and/or now that you have upgraded boarding revenue. Can you quantify that at all, please? Thanks. Ryan Green : Yes, we generate hundreds of millions of dollars from those boarding products on an annual basis. And like I said, we just had a record here in the second quarter. So those revenues continue to grow. Tammy Romo : Yes. And just for second quarter, just to give you a little, EarlyBird alone was in excess of $100 million. Operator : Our next question will come from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Just curious on the RASM decline for Q3, is that just kind of like a return to seasonality and capacity going up? And are you seeing any sharp drop-off after, say, like mid-August, and how does that compare with 2022 and maybe more people were flying off season? Thanks. Ryan Green : Yes. Hey Leslie, it\u2019s Ryan. So certainly, there is a RASM headwind with the capacity growth that\u2019s a little bit -- or that\u2019s above seasonal norms in the third quarter. So, there\u2019s definitely a headwind there. But if you take third quarter on balance and just look at the demand in place, I\u2019m very encouraged by where the third quarter sits today. We are anticipating a record third quarter revenue here over the next couple of months. We have more bookings in place actually at this point in the curve for third quarter than we had at the same time -- same point in time in the curve for second quarter. We had an all-time record fare sale in June for our fall travel. We had top 10 booking days during that fare sale and including our all-time record for bookings taken in a single day. And that compares to -- even when we open up schedules for the summer or for the holidays, we took more bookings for the fall during the fare sale than we have any other day in our history. So, we\u2019ve got a tremendous base of bookings in place for the fall. I think that that shows a lot of demand for the Southwest Airlines product, like we\u2019ve talked about on the call. And from a fare standpoint, July is roughly booked at this point and the strong fare environment from the second quarter has persisted here into July. So, I think that while RASM is decelerating here in the third quarter, we do have the capacity headwinds. But when you compare that to some of the domestic RASM of our peers, I think the way we\u2019re shaping up looks favorable. Operator : Our next question will come from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I guess, the pilots have been talking a lot about attrition in the last couple of months. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something you\u2019re seeing in your data, if it\u2019s at a level that\u2019s unusual or concerning? And then, I guess, if so, like do you have a sense of when in their careers are pilot leaving or a sense of why? Andrew Watterson : It\u2019s definitely a hot pilot market. And so you -- I guess, hot employee market as well. You have to work extra to hire people and to keep people. And so, it\u2019s a record year from our pilot hiring. It\u2019s also a record year for pilot attrition, but it\u2019s a modest number that is not sufficient to actually change our plan. So, we -- our amount of flying we have this year and the next is not at all affected by this, kind of, a little bit uptick in attrition this year. We do see pilots as a kind of a job hop around the industry, trying to maximize their personal game, what airline appeals them the best. And I don\u2019t begrudge that to them because it\u2019s -- once you start with the main line, it becomes there for a little while it\u2019s kind of lifelong commitment because seniority system. And so we do see some people who come and leave right away, but it\u2019s -- I think it kind of spiked here in the second quarter and now it\u2019s kind of even starting to tail off a little bit. Bob Jordan : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s definitely higher than normal, and again, as Andrew said, completely makes sense in the context of the hottest pilot market in history. But I think where that impacts the business, I mean we -- our plan was to hire 17 -- I think 1,700 pilots net this year. We\u2019re still on that plan. And that, of course, was intended to fly the whole fleet, get all of our aircraft back up of the year. In the area, we\u2019ll do that in the third quarter -- by the end of the third quarter, actually ahead of our original plan, which was the fourth quarter. So I feel good about all of this. And yes, I think the fact that the attrition is up a bit is not a surprise given this is the hottest market for pilots, I believe, in history. Operator : We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from David Slotnick with TPG. David Slotnick : Following up a little bit on what Leslie asked. It\u2019s -- I understand where the RASM headwind would be. But just considering that -- considering the capacity growth, do you think that they are going to stay similar or come down? Do you think pricing power is going to fall a little bit in the fall? And then, just secondary to that, are you expecting to see really any kind of return to the shoulder season seasonality that we had pre pandemic, or are you really seeing just leisure travel staying at study levels into the fall? Thanks. Ryan Green : Hi, David. Yes, I think the demand environment, I\u2019d just characterize the demand environment, especially for leisure as strong and that it continues to be that way. We don\u2019t have a ton of visibility into the fourth quarter at this point. So I wouldn\u2019t comment really too much for the fourth quarter. But certainly, as you look ahead at the third quarter, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a very strong base of bookings in place. And the fare environment, as I look at what we\u2019re taking here in July, and admittedly, we\u2019re still in the summer travel season here in July, but that strong fare environment continues. As you look third quarter to second quarter, yields normally give -- are weaker quarter-over-quarter, and I expect that to be the case as we go -- as we look at third quarter versus second quarter, but that\u2019s normal. But all of this is setting up for another record revenue quarter for us in the third quarter. Bob Jordan : And I think we probably mentioned this several times, but if you look at our fare performance in the second quarter and sort of run that through, you just have to be aware of this breakage change from last year, about $300 million impact that impacted year-over-year the fare calculation. So if you just look at average fares year-over-year, I think it looks like they\u2019re down 2.7%. If you normalize that for the breakage impact last year, they\u2019re actually up this year, 2.2%. They\u2019re actually up. So I just -- as you think about our fares and extrapolating that, just want to make sure you know that because they are actually up year-over-year. David Slotnick : Thank you. And then just from what visibility you do have, do you think that a shoulder season is going to come back for this fall, or is that sort of the thing in the past? Ryan Green : I think I just would characterize what we\u2019re seeing in terms of demand and the bookings that we have in place for the fall that would -- that tells me that we\u2019ve got a strong third quarter ahead of us here. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Anthony. If you all have any other follow-up questions, you can reach our communications team at 214-792-4847 or through our media website portal at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all so much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello everyone, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. My name is Jamie and I will be moderating today\u2019s conference. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Mrs. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead. Julia Landrum : Thank you so much. And welcome everyone to our third quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. We also reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. Please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Bob Jordan : Well, thanks Julia and good morning everyone. Before we jump into the financials, I wanted to acknowledge that there have been heart wrenching challenges around the world the past several months. And we\u2019ve had natural disasters in the communities that we serve. Earlier this quarter, I visited our team in Maui and witnessed firsthand the impact from the catastrophic wildfires on the island. Our hearts go out to all those who are suffering, and we\u2019re really proud of the support we are providing including the volunteer efforts of our employees. Now moving to the results, operating revenues for the third quarter were just over $6.5 billion, up nearly 5% from the same period last year and a third quarter record. Despite the recent uptick in fuel prices and other inflationary pressures, we are again profitable with net income of $240 million excluding special items. Revenue strength was driven by solid leisure demand throughout the quarter and by managed business continuing to come in largely as expected, and Ryan will share more details with you, but overall, demand remains healthy. As we close out this quarter and look ahead to the end of the year, we are very pleased with our accomplishments. We are running a great operation, reaching significant milestones, completing important initiatives, and delivering great customer experience enhancements. We\u2019re making great progress on labor agreements including yesterday\u2019s announcement of a tentative agreement with our incredible flight attendants. The team will walk you through many of these accomplishments, but for now, I want to talk to you about immediate actions we are taking to adapt to the current demand environment and solidify our path to operational and financial excellence. Perhaps the biggest milestone is completion of our network restoration plan in the fourth quarter of this year. Reaching this milestone has obviously been a year\u2019s long effort and has taken heroic coordination across the entire organization. It\u2019s just incredibly challenging and I am so appreciative of every single employee. It truly was a whole company accomplishment. With this behind us, however, we are set up really well to focus on optimizing our business. That starts with reflowing the fleet order book to support orderly growth, and to that end, we just announced a new order book with our partner, Boeing, yet another milestone. This sets us up for orderly and measured growth and gives us flexibility to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have a lot of options as we move forward and we will plan in a way that allows us both the flexibility to move up or down, and this order book combined with opportunities to retire -700s and modernize our fleet supports that really well. Finally, as we move into 2024, we are carefully evaluating the current macro environment and post-pandemic travel behaviors to create the best possible plan for the Company. We are now planning for a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in nominal ASMs in the first quarter 2024. This will result in capacity growth on a year-over-year basis of approximately 10% to 12%, all of which is carryover from growth this year. Note that this is a reduction from what we shared in July which was an expectation to grow approximately 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023. Therefore, for the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets, and designing schedules for current travel patterns. This plan offers us the ability to redirect the teams that have worked so effectively to get us staffed and restored to now focus on better optimizing the operation. We will be relentless in our focus to wring out inefficiencies, drive productivity, increase reliability, and our goal to return margins to historic levels. We are still hard at work on both our 2024 and long-term plans, but we are building them with a priority and a focus on generating value, value for our employees, value for our customers, and of course, value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob and hello everyone. First, I would like to extend another thanks to our wonderful employees for their continued hard work this year, especially in challenging environment. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance, so I will jump right to cost. Beginning with fuel, our third quarter jet fuel price was $2.78 per gallon, towards the higher end of our guidance as crude oil prices consistently rose throughout the quarter, peaking to nearly $100 per barrel in late September, and rising refinery margins added further pressure to our third quarter fuel price. Moving into fourth quarter, we currently estimate our fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, which includes an estimated $0.19 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.85 to $2.95 per gallon range including $0.14 of hedging gains. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for fourth quarter through 2026 is $538 million. We added modestly to our fuel hedge position for 2026 during third quarter. We continue to be roughly 50% hedged in 2023 and are currently 55% hedged in 2024, in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not immune to rising oil prices, I am grateful that our hedging positions relieve some of the additional pressure. We continue to look for prudent opportunities to build out our hedge position for future years. Moving to nonfuel cost, our third quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 4.4% was right in line with our previous guidance range, driven primarily by higher labor rates for all employee work groups and the timing of planned maintenance expenses. Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we currently estimate our CASM-X to decrease significantly year-over-year. There is a lot of noise in the year-over-year comparisons and the magnitude of the decrease is primarily due to impacts from elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of last year\u2019s operational disruption. Our guidance range is inclusive of wage rate increases associated with the recently announced tentative agreement with our flight attendants. You can find additional details in this morning\u2019s press release. Given inflationary pressures, particularly labor rates, combined with moderated capacity growth, we are expecting increased headwinds to our 2024 year-over-year cost. While we hit major milestones this year, our margins are not where they need to be and we intend to be relentless until we deliver. We therefore plan to adapt our network and capacity plans to support both a reliable operation and improved returns on investments. Given our company\u2019s commitment and history towards maintaining a competitive cost advantage, our goal will always be to manage costs accordingly. Now turning to our fleet, during third quarter, we received a total of 18 -8 deliveries and retired 4 -700s, ending the quarter with a fleet of 817 total aircraft. And we just finalized a new order book with Boeing which funds our long-term mid single digit growth plan and provides us the ability to phase out the -700 fleet over time, that really it gives us just a lot of flexibility. We provided full details on the new order book in this morning\u2019s release.  We now expect to receive 85 -8s this year and plan to retire 41 -700s. This leaves our net expected increase of 44 aircraft unchanged from our previous guidance. Taking all this into consideration, our 2023 CapEx outlook remains approximately $3.5 billion. Looking to 2024, reiterating what Bob shared, we are planning for capacity levels that better match the current environment. We now expect 2024 capacity to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. With our new order book, we have the fleet flexibility we need to organize the Company around a disciplined financial plan, one that we can adjust up or down to adapt to the current environment. We continue to expect our five-year capital spending on average to be in line with our previous guidance of roughly $4 billion per year. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong. We are the only U.S. airline with an investment grade rating by all three rating agencies. We have $11.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we continue to be in a net cash position. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $400 million to our shareholders through dividend payment and made debt repayments of nearly $80 million. Closing out the year we expect to pay a modest $7 million in scheduled debt repayments and continue to expect our 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. Let me close by saying, I am tremendously proud of our people and their hard work. As we look ahead, it is imperative we remain focused on building our 2024 plans and beyond to provide a resolute path to prosperity for our company, our employees and our shareholders. We have a history that proves we do not rest on our laurels and I\u2019m confident we have all the elements needed to bring about the success you should expect from Southwest Airlines. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Ryan Green : Thank you, Tammy. I\u2019m going to walk through a review of our third quarter revenue results, provide context for our fourth quarter outlook and share some exciting commercial updates with you today. For additional detail on our revenue performance, please see this morning\u2019s earnings release. Starting with third quarter, demand continues to be healthy. Operating revenue was a third quarter record of just over $6.5 billion and on a year-over-year basis operating revenue was up nearly 5%. And that\u2019s on a tough compare period given pent-up domestic travel was still underway last year. When you compare revenue performance versus third quarter of 2019, operating revenue is up nearly 16% on 12% capacity growth. Also average fares were up 2.6% year-over-year and are up over 7% over third quarter 2019. So, while we have work to do to cover our unit cost challenges, I am pleased we are moving in the right direction. The nearly 5% operating revenue growth year-over-year on a capacity increase of 12.5% had unit revenue or RASM declining 6.8% for the third quarter of 2023. July 4th and Labor Day travel came right in line with our expectations. However, bookings for non-peak August and September, while stable, came in at the lower end of our expectations. This performance aligns with fall start dates for primary and secondary schools continuing to shift earlier in much of the country. For example, in our markets, a third of schools were back in session by the second week of August, which is nearly double what it was pre-pandemic and nearly 95% of schools were back before the Labor Day weekend. We are planning for these back to school trends to continue as we work on our August 2024 capacity plans. In addition, we had multiple records set from our ancillary products and our loyalty program. We had an all-time best quarter for ancillary revenue with 24% year-over-year growth and Rapid Rewards set a third quarter record for revenue generated from the program. New Rapid Rewards member acquisitions were a quarterly record and the number of engaged members grew 10% on a year-over-year basis. Rapid Rewards point redemptions were up 16% compared to the same period last year and retail spend on our co-brand Chase Credit Card was also a third quarter record. Our customers love the benefits they get from the card as evidenced by our low cardholder attrition which continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, we see a resilient consumer and high engagement with the Southwest Airlines brand. Consumer spending trends still favor services, particularly travel experiences, and we expect that will continue. Moving to the fourth quarter, we are seeing a continuation of healthy leisure booking demand and stable business travel patterns. As a result, we expect a nominal sequential increase in operating revenue, resulting in record fourth quarter revenue and passengers which would bring us to three consecutive quarters of record operating revenue. October performance has been strong to date and bookings for the holidays as a whole are also strong. RASM however continues to be impacted by higher than seasonally normal capacity, driven by our network restoration plan, a larger than normal investment in development markets, and business travel that while improving is still below historical levels. We also expect the close-in leisure trends we saw in non-peak August and September will persist into the non-holiday periods of the fourth quarter, and our guidance range does contemplate potential challenges from this year\u2019s holiday placement including the expectation that a portion of return travel will spill into January. I am encouraged however that we have higher booked load factors for the December holiday period this year than we had at the same point last year, which indicates to me we\u2019re not experiencing significant book away as a result of last year\u2019s operational disruption. All-in, we expect RASM in the fourth quarter to finish down 9% to 11% on a year-over-year basis on capacity up approximately 21%. Again, we are steadfastly committed to addressing RASM performance to ensure a revenue plan that is appropriate. For the current near-term, we are continuing to execute a strategy of fare sale campaigns to address low demand flights with meaningful advanced purchase requirements. This helps build load factor in suboptimal capacity without impacting higher demand flights or diluting close-in yield strength. Looking to 2024, as Bob mentioned, we will address RASM by moderating capacity to better match demand and optimizing our schedules to accommodate current travel behaviors. Our current set of strategic initiatives including GDS participation and the new revenue management system will also contribute incremental pre-tax profits to 2024 as they mature and hit their full run rates. Finally, we\u2019re tireless in working to make customer experience on Southwest Airlines even better and drive even more loyalty from our customers. Earlier this month we announced several exciting updates and the first involves several enhancements to our award winning Rapid Rewards program. We will add the ability for customers to combine Rapid Reward points with cash next spring which increases the ubiquity of our loyalty currency and makes it easier to book additional flights on Southwest Airlines. We also made it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels in 2024 and are looking to reward our customers for their loyalty and entice them to fly with us whenever they travel. We have an imperative to win more customers and drive more travel from our most frequent travelers, and these enhancements are designed to give them even more reasons to choose Southwest Airlines. We also launched a new product for our corporate customers last week that will help us continue to grow our market share in the managed travel space. Our new product streamlines the process to book group travel for meetings, incentives and conventions, which is one of the fastest growing segments in the managed travel space. I\u2019m very pleased with the response to the product so far as we already have millions of dollars in travel booked on the new tool in just the first few days. Finally, we recently introduced customer bag tracking, which gives our customers the ability to track their checked bags throughout their day of travel, both at the airport and in flight. This improvement was one of the investments we accelerated following last December\u2019s disruption. By providing additional transparency and information to customers about where their bags are during their travel journey, we\u2019re elevating the travel experience and removing friction for our customers. This enhancement is an early release of our larger digital hospitality modernization plan. So, congratulations to the teams that worked so hard to bring these great enhancements and solutions to market for our customers. Ultimately, we have to continue to win customers while taking into account the challenges of higher cost inputs as we build both our long-term commercial strategies and our near-term revenue plans, and we are committed to doing just that. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I am going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a brief overview of our operational performance, an update on our winter operations action plan, and some additional details on our capacity and network plans for next year. Before I dive into those details, I want to commend both, negotiating committees that worked diligently on tentative agreement just to reach their flight attendants, which will be voted on by our employees soon. This agreement offers industry leading compensation increases and quality of life enhancements. I\u2019m very pleased with our strong improvements in operational performance and very appreciative of our Southwest Warriors. We saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics, which were recognized by our customers through increased trip Net Promoter Scores. Our early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential, completion factor, mishandled bag rate, long delay rate and on-time performance all showed substantial year-over-year improvement. If not for longer than anticipated block times from congestion, weather and runway construction, our performance would have been even better. All of this resulted in a trip Net Promoter Score that is nearly 4 points higher than last year. That is certainly driven by our proven reliability, but also our customer experience initiatives including our improved Wi-Fi. We are excited about this solid trend in the right direction. It gives us lots of reasons to be optimistic about 2024. And speaking of the right direction, I\u2019m excited to share an update on our winter preparedness. The disruption we had last winter was really hard on our customers and our employees. It weighs heavily on all of us here at Southwest Airlines. We have a lot of pride based on our 50-plus-year history. So, preparing to prevent something like that from happening again was and is an imperative. Of course, the disruption was triggered by an unprecedented storm that simultaneously hit several of our most critical stations, but there were many causes, not just one, that led to it. As a result, our action plan is divided into three categories : winter operations, cross-team collaboration and accelerating operational investments which were already on our roadmap, including technology. One thing that really impacted us with Elliott is a 25% of our crew are based in Denver and Chicago. When we are unable to maintain sufficient throughput during winter operations, we can\u2019t get our crew out into the network. When this happens, it puts great stress on our crew network, which is what happened with Elliott. So, a key part of our action plan is to have more robust winter operations, so we can be confident that we get our crews out in the network to operate through bad weather. So, we invested in key stations based on calculated throughput needed to maintain our crew network, we have added de-ice pads, de-ice trucks, increased glycol storage and mixing stations, increased snow removal, heater carts and other equipment to operate safely and effectively in winter weather. We have been conducting de-icing summer school to make sure we have plenty of ramp agents trained and ready to go for de-icing. That\u2019s just a few examples of tangible things we have done. We are now so much better prepared for these extreme weather events. Moving to cross-team collaboration, we now have our network planning and network operations teams under the same organization, allowing them to work together to make the best decisions quickly. We have formed a special operating group, called the Network Disruption Pod to coordinate decision making in our control center when there are high risk disruption events and have used this group for events this summer. Additionally, we have conducted multiple operations wide tabletop exercises, often called War Games involving winter weather scenarios to prepare our teams for the season. And we have talked a lot already about the immediate modernization of and enhancement to our systems. Early on, there was a misconception that technology problems caused an operational disruption. It was the opposite. Operational problems caused technology problems. Since the disruption, we\u2019ve bolstered those systems with upgrades to address the specific issues we experienced during Winter Storm Elliott. We\u2019re also rolling out a proprietary new system that is unique in the industry that takes a crew first approach when developing solutions to large scale and regular operations. I share all that detail and really those are just a few examples to demonstrate the level of action we have taken. We are set up better than ever and feel confident as we go into the holiday -- winter holiday travel season. Finally, I\u2019ll wrap up by talking a little bit more about what we\u2019re doing with capacity and the network next year to ensure that we are on a path to operational and financial excellence. Going back to April, we committed to orderly and measured growth. Stable growth helps us regain efficiency, absorb our hiring, mature our workforce and improve our operational performance. We also have to take into consideration demand levels and travel patterns as we determine our growth and build our network. As we develop our 2024 capacity set, we are doing exactly that. In the past couple of years, we focused on growth to restore our network and fully utilize our fleet. That combined with business travel trends and our investments in Hawaii and new cities has created challenges to our current unit revenue performance. Therefore, as we look to 2024, we are moderating our capacity, which will allow the growth to be absorbed. And as we shared last quarter, we are taking actions to accelerate the maturation of our developing markets and to optimize our schedules to current travel patterns. The most recent examples is today\u2019s announcement that we\u2019re shifting the bulk of the international service in Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. This will offer better connectivity in our domestic network via the nearly 140 daily departures at MCO. We are fully committed to delivering on a plan that enables operational excellence, improves operational efficiency and reiterating what Bob said at the beginning of the call, that generates value for our employees, customers and shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions. So, a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Savi Syth : If I might on the 2024 plan, you talked about inflationary headwinds to unit costs. And you historically don\u2019t necessarily adjust capacity once kind of schedules are loaded. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on how we should think about unit costs in 2024. Is this going to be up year-over-year, and some of the kind of bigger drivers of the unit cost trends? Bob Jordan : I want to start just first with sort of just kind of where we are with the quarter. I mean, the quarter was really solid. I mean, record operating revenues, passengers, Rapid Reward program revenues, retail spend on the card, new members in the program, so I mean just really pleased with the quarter. And obviously another accomplishment was restoring the network and getting all of our aircraft flying. So, we do have higher sequential capacity and just higher capacity general than typical. And as you know, travel patterns are changing for -- while it\u2019s still strong, they are changing for leisure, but they are also changing for business as the -- we are seeing gains, but that last 10 to 15 points of business recovery is a little bit stubborn here. So, we are working on capacity. Don\u2019t want to be slavies to capacity here. So we\u2019re going in and we are reducing the first quarter. The shoulder periods are just tougher, January, February. We are not ready to talk about the whole 2024 plan. We\u2019re working on that right now very diligently. But our overall planning capacity for the year has come down to the 6 to 8 range, which is essentially all carryover from the restoring capacity in \u201823, just carrying over into \u201824, But that\u2019s going to result in things like nominal seats in the back half of next year that will actually be down as compared to 2022. So, I just want to set the -- sort of lay the groundwork for how we\u2019re thinking about capacity. It\u2019s all about two things. It\u2019s about maturing and absorbing the capacity that we have stored in \u201823 and \u201824, that\u2019s really how we\u2019re thinking about capacity. As you pull down capacity, that will create pressure obviously on cost, it always does. We\u2019re still working on our plan. We\u2019re going to work both sides of the equation. We\u2019re going to work the cost and the efficiency plan here. We\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity to drive out efficiencies as we slow the growth and focus on pulling down our hiring and getting folks out of training, all those kinds of things. But we\u2019re going to work the revenue side as well. But yes, I just would admit that it does put a little bit of pressure on our cost as we pull down capacity, always does. Tammy, if you want to say anything? Tammy Romo : You covered everything really well, Bob. Just, Savi, to give you maybe just a little more color on where we\u2019re seeing the obvious cost pressures. Clearly, as we\u2019ve wrapped up a lot of agreements this year with our labor group, we have seen more inflation than normal in labor. And that\u2019s driven by the higher wage rates. And we\u2019ve been, as you know, accruing for those throughout the year. And then outside of labor, we\u2019re -- we\u2019ll see some inflationary pressures in maintenance as our 800 fleet is coming off of the holiday. So, just wanted you to keep that in mind as that wind down. But we are very -- all that said, we are focused in on our 2024 plan. We are going to work really hard here to drive efficiencies and certainly leverage our network opportunities. So, a little premature to give you guidance for the year, but we\u2019re going to keep working really hard on our plan here to manage our CASM-X costs going forward. And we haven\u2019t backed off of our Investor Day, what we shared with you at our 2022 Investor Day. Our longer term goal is to grow CASM-X in the low single digit range, and that would be on mid single digit capacity growth. Savi Syth : That\u2019s all very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe kind of following up on that. Just on the fleet side, I know you have a contractual fleet here. Is your goal to again take as many aircraft and then offset it with retirements or how should we think about the aircraft deliveries next year, and maybe Boeing\u2019s ability to meet it? Bob Jordan : Yes. Savi, the goal number one with our -- and we\u2019ve been talking about reflowing our fleet order book with Boeing. Goal number one was to just get to orderly steady growth in the fleet plan. I think, if you look at -- we were stacking a lot of aircraft up that were delayed, and I think it pushed beyond even what you saw in the plan, a delivery expectation of 143, I think in 2024, which, of course, we\u2019re not doing. So, I\u2019m really happy, Boeing has been a great partner. We\u2019ve got a new fleet plan that takes us -- that is very orderly. It takes us through 2031 at very attractive pricing, and there is a lot of flexibility in the new order book. So, we can flex up and we can flex down, as you see demand trends changing both ways. Just thinking about 2023, we\u2019ve been talking about, again, taking control of the order and delivery plan and planning to that in our schedules, we plan to 70. Boeing looks like we will now be able to take 85 this year from Boeing and we\u2019ll just offset that directly with retirements, which of course is a -- that\u2019s a solid financial trade. And then, our goal next year is to take 85. Now, Tammy, do you want to add anything? Tammy Romo : You covered it all. Bob Jordan : But again, the new order is all about reflowing this so that the growth is orderly and steady and we have access to a lot of aircraft at attractive pricing and we have a lot of flexibility. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Maybe just a follow-up on the cost question, if you don\u2019t mind. Two things. I know you\u2019re not prepared to talk about exact guidance on 2024, and I totally appreciate that the growth plans have changed. But I think last quarter you said you were committed to driving cost down year-over-year. Are we just back at the drawing table for that? And then, on the labor inflationary pressures you\u2019re talking about, I know you\u2019ve been accruing this year. So, what\u2019s driving that incremental into next year? Is that just wage rate increases are higher than they used to be or something else in the pay package? Tammy Romo : Just to give you a little more help there, it really boils down to two factors. One is, we have moderated our capacity growth plans and we are continuing to see labor rate pressure. And just to really take you maybe through our fourth quarter cost profile to help you as you sort of model for first quarter. If you exclude the 15-point year-over-year disruption related impact to our fourth quarter CASM-X outlook, we would actually be down 1% to 4% year-over-year. And as Bob mentioned earlier, in terms of our cost profile, while we\u2019ve had some structural cost increases here, our cost advantage relative to the industry and the legacy carriers is still very much intact. But if you move sequentially from fourth quarter, the cost headwinds are stemming mostly from overall inflation, namely labor cost. That is our most significant inflationary factor. And despite the labor accruals we\u2019ve been recording -- we still expect year-over-year pressure next year from normal annual step -- and scale increases, as you would expect. And then just beyond those labor cost pressures, we anticipate continued year-over-year cost pressure by the accelerated depreciation related to our fleet modernization efforts and already mentioned maintenance costs. So again, the key reconciling item here is the fact that we\u2019ve moderated our capacity plans for next year, which does put further pressure to our unit cost. But we are not done with our 2024 plan, and we\u2019re not content with our cost outlook. So, we are rolling up our sleeves, and we\u2019re going to keep working on and proving that outlook. So, that hopefully gives you a little bit more color into kind of the cost and what is sticky. And again, our focus now is on ringing out those cost inefficiencies and driving for better productivity as we moderate our growth plans next year. So, we\u2019re going to stay hard at work on managing our costs. We have a great track record in doing that. And we\u2019re determined to manage our costs as we have for our 50-plus history. Bob Jordan : And of course, for everybody, I mean, the labor cost increases are -- that\u2019s a phenomenon we are all seeing as we all renegotiate contracts and some of the timing is different for folks, but those are going to be costs that I think you\u2019re going to see generally across the board. It always takes -- they\u2019re coming in a lump. And it always takes time to adapt to the higher cost structure and as you move across a period of time. The good thing is back to the network work. We are very committed to taking network action. We had already announced last quarter a full restructuring of the network that is going to yield over $500 million in pretax profit contribution in 2024. Beyond that now, we\u2019re moderating the first quarter. We\u2019re moderating the full year. Again, you\u2019re going to have seats in the back half of the year that are actually going to be down nominally year-over-year. And all of that is designed to match the demand to the network and match the network to the demand, which should ultimately help revenue production, help RASM production. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Maybe just my follow-up. We\u2019re going through another earnings season where there\u2019s quite a lot of focus on premium products. I guess, is your view that those will still prove to be cyclical in the next downturn, whenever that might be? I guess, really just interested in hearing how you\u2019re assessing demand for premium products and what data points could change your mind on your current product offering? Bob Jordan : Yes. I\u2019ll start, then Ryan can back clean up with me here. But it\u2019s the -- I don\u2019t want to speak for others, and it\u2019s always hard to predict the future. But yes, there\u2019s clearly an outperformance in long-haul international and premium right now, like there was an outperformance in domestic leisure this time last year. Typically, trends moderate. They always have been in this business for a very long time, and all things tend to sort of work their way back to a trend here. We\u2019ll see. And if you think about Southwest Airlines, we\u2019ve got a tremendous coach product. We\u2019ve got terrific seating and great rep rewards program and Wi-Fi and all kinds of amenities we\u2019re putting in power and larger overhead bins. We just announced bag tracking. So we\u2019re obviously enhancing our product ourselves, which is a little different than premium, but certainly I think we have the most attractive coach product in the industry. Maybe attached to that, we\u2019re always looking at what our customers, our preferences are and what they\u2019re telling us, and we\u2019ll always study that. And if over time, those preferences change. We\u2019ll take a look at what that means for Southwest Airlines. Ryan? Ryan Green : Yes. The only thing I would add is historically, premium revenue has been one of the more cyclical items in the industry overall. So, the recovery from the pandemic has been a little bit different than other periods. So, we\u2019re watching it closely. If we -- if there is some shift in consumer demand here that we need to take note of and evolve the product, we will. But I think you want to be very careful with that and study that very closely given the cyclical nature historically of premium revenue. But just like we have over our 50-year history, we listen to customers. We understand how -- what they\u2019re demanding and preferences, how those change. And we\u2019ve evolved our product over time and we\u2019ll continue to do that as we go forward, as we need to. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Probably a question that\u2019s been asked a handful of times over the last few years. I understand the plan is to get margins up over time over the long run. But, is there a specific plan to get margins up in 2024? We hear a lot of pushback from investors about your unit revenue kind of exit rate, and I think folks are kind of extrapolating that into the future and they\u2019re having a hard time seeing that path in 2024. So, what does that path look like? And what will be required to get margins up next year? And is that explicitly a plan? Bob Jordan : Yes. Duane, obviously, that is absolutely the plan to improve margins in 2024, and we\u2019re committed to getting back to our long term outperformance and operating margin. We\u2019re talking about adapting to these new cost levels that will take time, but we\u2019re moving quickly. That is a big piece of adapting the network and matching customer demand and these new demand trends to the network that we put out for our customers, both business and leisure. We have a lot of opportunity to wring out cost inefficiency through operating leverage, through new tools, through managing our headcount. We\u2019ve got a lot of folks that are locked up in training as an example. As we slow our hiring and slow our growth here, that will come out in terms of costs. We have a lot of cost plays that we can make. We\u2019re still working on our 2024 plans. But yes, I can assure you that a return -- growth in 2024 and then a return to industry-leading margins and the margins that our shareholders expect is absolutely a commitment. Tammy? I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything, Tammy? Tammy Romo : Yes. No, I thought that was very well said. But again, we know we have work to do, and we\u2019re fully committed to delivering on a 2024 plan that enables our operational excellence. We\u2019re going to drive operational efficiency. And as Bob said earlier, work both sides of the equation. So, stay tuned as we work through that. We\u2019ll be back with more details. And I just do want to remind you, as we\u2019ve already shared, the estimated benefit of our network optimization efforts along with the continued maturation of our development markets. We\u2019re still working on our plans. And as we\u2019ve shared, we do expect that to exceed $500 million in incremental year-over-year pretax profits next year. But clearly, more work ahead, and we\u2019ll -- we\u2019re hard at work for you. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. I appreciate those direct answers. But maybe just to throw out an alternative, if you can\u2019t get your margins going in the right direction next year, if it\u2019s more like 25% or 26%, what might you consider strategically or put on the table that hasn\u2019t been on the table before? So if you think about things like seat assignments, base economy, bags fly free, historically, those have been sacrosanct. I mean, would there be more of an urgency to more aggressively take a look at the product and the service offering if you can\u2019t get there next year? Bob Jordan : Yes. I mean, again, we\u2019re working on our 2024 plan, so we\u2019re not ready to lay all that out. The last set of initiatives that we took you through several years ago, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT this year are paying off, and we\u2019ll have a next set. Some of those, I think, will make perfect sense. We have the ability to put flights into places where we can drive, obviously, operating leverage. So, those flight activities come on at lower CASM rates. We have some areas where we can continue to really push the generation of revenue outside the cabin. Obviously, that centers around the Rapid Rewards program development. And other areas, we have opportunities in terms of how we fly the aircraft and where we can drive up utilization and generate additional ASMs without having to take on capital costs on new aircraft. I\u2019m just not -- we\u2019re just not ready to share the whole plan with you. I\u2019m just trying to convey that we\u2019re hard at work, and there is a lot on the table. To your specific question about things in the cabin or boarding, I would go back to what Ryan said, which is we are going to follow the lead of our customers. And if our customers ultimately tell us that that is what they want, and that is what we will do. We\u2019re not ready to -- obviously not ready to say that today. But our customers will dictate what is important to them, whether that\u2019s an attribute of the product or things that are around boarding in the cabin. So again, don\u2019t read too much into that, but just to understand that that is something that we are constantly taking a look at. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate that. I guess over the years, you deserve the benefit of the doubt when you\u2019re printing industry-leading margins and saying we\u2019re going to go with what our customers want. But if you have lagging margins, it may require a harder look. But, I appreciate you taking the questions. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Yes. I would just add -- I understand. And just we will be absolutely relentless in meeting our goals. That includes driving out efficiency and productivity that includes improving the revenue side of the equation, and that includes driving ourselves back to industry-leading margins. You have my commitment. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Two here. I guess, first one to Andrew, if I caught you correctly, you had indicated that you were moving up your international service from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. I mean, Fort Lauderdale, I think, has been one of your original international gateways. What were the factors that drove you to move up? I mean, I know you have a pilot domicile in Orlando, but it is a smaller local market. That seems to be a pretty meaningful move. Andrew Watterson : Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. We -- as we mentioned earlier, we were -- we have relooked at our network and moved our capacity around. So, it\u2019s both the amount of capacity and the nature of the capacity. We did both of those moves. First, we kind of were doing the nature with our reconfiguration that Tammy referenced earlier. And for Orlando, we do have a lot more northbound flights, if you will. The international destinations, even though they loom large in our mind, they actually are modest-sized markets that require a decent amount of connectivity to fill them up. And so, Orlando being a little bit further north and having more flights for Southwest Airlines north of Orlando allows us to have the good complement of the local plus the flow. So a lot of the international destinations were to take our customer base here on vacation because we are a repeat purchase business. And so, we want our network in any given location to offer chances to fly for business, to go to Orlando, to go to Vegas, to go see grandma, to go on vacation and the beach. And so sometimes that\u2019s nonstop, sometimes that\u2019s connecting. And for a lot of the international, it requires us to offer that as a connection for some of our kind of further northern cities. So, Orlando, the combination of the local market plus allowing us to access our big customer bases on the Upper Midwest and Northeast makes a more network sense given scarce capacity, if you will. So net-net, that made sense. And then also, as you mentioned, the crew base in Orlando also makes the costs to serve that go down because you\u2019re not staging crews in down to Fort Lauderdale. So work on both sides of the equation, as Bob said, revenue and costs, it made more sense for our international anchor in the Southeast to be Orlando. Mike Linenberg : Andrew, just to sort of follow up on that, like 1.5 years ago, 2 years ago when you guys talked about some of your initiatives. One of the focuses for longer term was to increase your connectivity. Is this a bit of a trial run in sort of focusing on this one market? And if it succeeds that that type of connectivity, you\u2019ll look at applying that to other gateway cities. Is that sort of the plan here? Andrew Watterson : No, I think this is -- during COVID, we had a kind of -- when demand was way down, and we have bigger aircraft, we don\u2019t have a lot of RJs, we had to use more than usual connectivity to fill our aircraft. And then post-COVID, we went back to our normal, which is felt between 25% and 30% of our customers in our connecting itinerary, that\u2019s been fairly stable, but they\u2019re concentrated in certain areas, they help us fill up the early and late parts of the day and they also help us support certain geographies. So going to Hawaii, we have -- we have certain gateways there that allow us to access our customers in land access Hawaii. The same thing for international, a combination of Baltimore plus now Orlando helps you access international from parts of our network. So connectivity has always been the icing, not the cake, but we were very intentional about how we use it. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Very good. And then just the second one to Ryan. When I think about the $500 million pretax benefits coming from various revenue initiatives. As I look at loyalty and ancillary, they were both records in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of maybe where ancillary is per passenger today, where it\u2019s been historically? Where does that go? And any sort of rough numbers on just remuneration from loyalty, maybe the size of that program? Ryan Green : Yes, no problem. Yes, ancillary and loyalty were both. We had several records in the third quarter, and I expect good performance here as we look forward into the fourth quarter. Ancillary revenue is significantly outpacing our passenger growth, largely on the back of our upgraded boarding benefit. We\u2019ve been able to increase prices there and hold on to take rates. EarlyBird as well is a strong performer. We\u2019ve been able to increase price rate -- or prices on EarlyBird as well as some of our other ancillary products that went into effect in August. We raised prices on excess bag fees, pet fees, things like that. So ancillary, absolutely is a standout. And I think I\u2019m expecting it to continue to exceed passenger growth in the fourth quarter. Loyalty overall, as you -- as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re following it, it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s a key part of our strategy going forward. Rapid Rewards is the most preferred loyalty program in the industry on lots of different measures, primarily because customers are able to actually use the points that they\u2019re earning. And so that\u2019s driving spend on the card. Third quarter spend on the card was a record, and we expect to continue growing the program over time. We also made some additional changes to Rapid Rewards here earlier this month that I think is also going to continue to drive engagement from our customers. And it\u2019s all about making it easier to get value out of the program for customers. We see when customers make a redemption, after that redemption, they fly us more, they spend more on their card. It just drives further engagement with Southwest Airlines. And so, doing things like adding the ability to combine cash and points, that\u2019s all about making it easier to use Rapid Reward points, which will then in turn provide value back to Southwest. Same thing with lowering the tier requirements for A-List and A-List Preferred. We\u2019re kind of bucking the industry trend there. Our competitors are making it harder to access benefits. We\u2019re making it easier. And again, there\u2019s value to the consumer there, but there\u2019s also value back to Southwest. Customers stretch to reach A-List, A-List Preferred, Companion Pass. They fly more, they spend more on their cards as they get close to that. And so bringing those thresholds in closer makes it better for the customer, but it also drives value back to Southwest. So, we\u2019ll continue to invest in Rapid Rewards and the program and ancillary overall. And I think we\u2019ll -- we should expect to see continued growth. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Helane Becker : Just a couple of questions to follow up. With the changes in Rapid Rewards and making it easier to earn what you would call status, isn\u2019t that kind of amounting to fare cuts across the board? Ryan Green : Amounting to fare cuts across the board? Helane Becker : Yes. I mean if it makes it easier for me to redeem my points, I mean, don\u2019t you wind up selling fewer revenue seats? Ryan Green : So, the way that we\u2019ve designed the loyalty program and the value exchange from the customer and the number of Rapid Reward points that it takes to redeem, we are -- we\u2019re indifferent whether or not the customer is flying for us on Rapid Reward points or paying cash. So, we\u2019ve taken that equation kind of off the table. The change here really is post-pandemic the same number of customers are traveling for business today than what they were before, and then leisure customers are actually up. The difference and what the gap in managed travel is, is that those individuals are flying a bit less frequently. And so, what our change to make the threshold easier to achieve is really just capitalizing on that fact, bringing the threshold in earlier. And as I was just explaining, we\u2019ll get benefit from that, too, because more customers will be able to stretch for A-List and A-List Preferred, which drives value back to us. Helane Becker : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then the other question I had for my follow-up was, I think at one point, you guided to $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT contribution in 2023. But I feel like that might be -- is that -- I guess, is that an easier comp because of Elliott last year that you\u2019ll be able to achieve that? Tammy Romo : Helane, we\u2019re delivering on the initiatives. And obviously, that includes things like our fleet modernization, our investments in GDS, our new revenue management system, et cetera. And even what just -- but in terms of the initiatives, those are driving and those are tracking in line with what we\u2019ve shared with you. And then we\u2019re continuing to invest, as Ryan took you through. And those investments just drive more engagement from our customers that makes them more and more loyal. So the initiatives that we\u2019ve shared with you are driving incremental value and we\u2019re continuing to track in line with what we\u2019ve shared with you. So, those are actually delivering. Now, that said, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019ve already shared with you -- we\u2019re not satisfied with where we stand now going into 2024. But as we\u2019ve shared, we\u2019re just not ready to lay it all out for you today, but we are working on our 2024 plan, and we\u2019ll certainly fill in more of the answers so that you can kind of see how it all weaves together here. So, stay tuned and more to come there. Julia Landrum : Okay. That concludes the analyst portion of our call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer. Linda Rutherford : Thank you, Jamie. I\u2019d like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Jamie, would you just give them instructions on how everyone can queue up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Alexandria Skores from The Dallas Morning News. Alexandria Skores : I wanted to ask, obviously, the flight attendants reached their tentative agreement yesterday. And pilots were picketing at headquarters today. So I kind of wanted to ask a little bit about -- I know that NMB has meetings scheduled with you all throughout November. What -- can you give us a sense of when a pilots\u2019 deal may come and what the time frame might look like on that? Bob Jordan : Alexandra, I just want to -- I\u2019ll answer your question, I promise, but I just wanted to say I\u2019m grateful, we all are, that we have a tentative agreement with our awesome flight attendants. There\u2019s still more work to do. The union is working on materials and training and then so they can get the information out to our flight attendants here quickly, so that they can then vote. But I\u2019m just real pleased with the milestone. Obviously, we\u2019ve had a really good 12 months. I think that\u2019s our eighth agreement in 12 months and we are committed to finishing up the others. Our swap agreement -- our swap negotiations are continuing. There\u2019s progress. I believe, Andrew, we\u2019re meeting every week. But obviously, we\u2019ve got to get it over the finish line. I don\u2019t know, would you like to add? Andrew Watterson : I think I\u2019ve been really encouraged over the last couple of months with both the pace and quality of negotiation meeting every week. Sometimes that\u2019s with the mediators and sometimes that\u2019s without the mediators. And so, we\u2019ve made -- we\u2019ve also had enhanced leadership negotiation from both sides, and leadership presence on negotiations from both sides, and that\u2019s worked out really well. Our mediators have been quite active. And so, we have to have both sides agree to get to a deal. So no one side can predict when it\u2019s going to finish. But we\u2019ve made substantial progress with a small but a difficult list of things remaining to close out. And I have confidence in our team and the SWAPA and negotiating committed to be able to do that in a timely fashion. The mediator has -- barring no government shutdown, more dates for us throughout the rest of this month and next month. And I also would say that the also negotiations with our ramp union, TWU 555. And so hope to be engaged with them here in the next couple of weeks for next step there. So we can -- that would then be the last deal for us to close out. Alexandria Skores : Yes. That was my second question was TWU 555, I understand they reached an agreement, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there was a ratification announcement. So, I\u2019m wondering if you all can give an update there. Andrew Watterson : That was a month or so ago. I can\u2019t recall exactly, Bob. But they\u2019ve voted that one down. Their union, as most unions do, follow up with the surveys to understand where the frontline workers, the members did not like the proposed agreement. Based on that feedback, the union will develop a slate of changes. We will do that on our side as well. And then, we\u2019ll get back together in early to mid-November to talk about next steps with them for the next round. We\u2019re not in mediation with that. We have I think very productive negotiations without mediators with the 555 and we expect that to continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Just curious about your discounting strategy. Your have fare sales frequently, but it seems like the fares are pretty low currently. Could you kind of put that into context with previous fare sales and how that compares and how you\u2019re thinking about the fourth quarter? Bob Jordan : Yes. Hey Leslie. We do -- we are finishing up restoration here. And so, we do have more seats to fill. I would characterize our promotional activity as being slightly more than normal. It\u2019s definitely not a tectonic shift from how promotional we have been historically, but there is a little bit more. When we have been -- as we have put those fare sales out there, we use some fairly sophisticated tactics and strategies to be very surgical in where we drive the demand. So oftentimes, those sale fares -- well, always, those sale fares are available when we have distressed inventory to sell. And we keep the higher demand flights. The promotion is not applicable on the higher demand flights. So it allows us to drive load without diluting yields. Yes. I would just also point out to relative to your comment on really low fares out there. The fares -- our average fare in the third quarter was up 2.6%. So if we were being -- if we were having to overly discount, you wouldn\u2019t expect average fares to be up. So, I think the strategy overall is working as designed. We\u2019ve got a lot of seats to fill. We\u2019re selling our distressed inventory through discounting and protecting our higher-yield flights. Leslie Josephs : And are there any specific routes or regions where you\u2019re seeing you\u2019re having to discount more or even times of the week or month or recent months? Ryan Green : It\u2019s less about the markets in different geographies and more about travel patterns today. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are tougher, shoulder periods of the day are tougher. And so that inventory is a little -- that\u2019s where a lot of the discounting is actually happening. We\u2019re adapting to those travel patterns and trends as we move forward here with our network optimization starting after the first of the year to reduce some shoulder flying, reduce -- further reduce some Tuesday, Wednesday flying to help address that. But it\u2019s more that than it is particular geographies. Operator : Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I was going to ask a question about how you are adjusting capacity to help with the reshaping of the business travel and the way it hasn\u2019t come back as you expected. And Ryan may have just answered that question, but I wanted to see if you could put a little bit more specifics out there on those adjustments, days of weeks, times of days, cutting frequencies, things like that. Bob Jordan : Yes. Mary, I\u2019ll talk and then Andrew and Ryan can finish, obviously, correct me. But yes, that really is why we are making the -- both the network adjustment and optimization that we had already announced that is in the first quarter that\u2019s worth over $500 million in profit next year. And then this new set of capacity adjustments, both in the first quarter and then throughout 2024 in the nonpeak period. It\u2019s really about the shoulder periods -- the nonpeak periods being more shoulder than before. So for example, some of that was backfilled by business travel, which, again, business travel is rising for us. It\u2019s just steady. It\u2019s just not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. But as an example, this reduction in January and February of 2024 next quarter, that is really all -- that\u2019s as much about matching new business travel demand trends and patterns as it is anything. So that carries through 2024, but yes. Andrew Watterson : You heard Bob -- Mary, this is Andrew, say that overall business travel is down maybe 10% or 15% versus 2019. So, it\u2019s not like a guardrail to guardrail move. It\u2019s just more a modest recalibration on network. So it is geared less -- a little bit less towards business, a little bit more towards leisure or mixed leisure business. Tuesday, Wednesday, which historically has been a more business travel heavy day will be much lower versus kind of Monday, Thursday, Friday. So, that was one big part of it. And also, if you look at certain cities, if you look at the route combinations, some routes would have predominantly business travel on it. And so, we\u2019ve replaced those routes in those cities, ones that have kind of either pure leisure or a mix of leisure and business. So, it\u2019s really a modest adjustment of the portfolio of routes as well as a kind of Tuesday, Wednesday reduction in overall capacity. Operator : Our next question comes from David Slotnick from TPG. David Slotnick : I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the lower-than-expected close-in bookings. Do you think this is a lengthening of the booking curve again, sort of a return to the pre-pandemic booking trends, or is this a one-off that maybe has something to do with the present environment? Andrew Watterson : I would just characterize it as we are moving back towards more pre-pandemic norms. Of course, managed business travel remains down relative to pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s -- the baseline in managed business is kind of slow and steady recovery, and we\u2019re picking up market share with our initiatives in the managed business space. And so, we feel good about that. But when you turn to the leisure piece of this, there is still more close-in leisure today than there was pre-pandemic, but it is not at the level of what we saw earlier this year at the end of last year. So, I think it\u2019s more of a reversing of trends here back to norms as kind of return to office trends and things like that also begin to change here a bit. I called it out in my prepared remarks, but specifically, in the third quarter, there\u2019s other things that would have impacted close-in leisure. The school calendar changes are pretty significant in August specifically. And a third -- in our markets, a third of schools were back in session the second week of August. That\u2019s double what it was pre-pandemic. And anybody that has kids, you usually don\u2019t travel the week before your kids go back to school. So that kind of wipes almost all of August out there for a third of travel in our market. So there\u2019s some things moving around in the macro environment that\u2019s impacting it. But I think just generally characterizing, we\u2019re kind of reverting back to norms. Ryan Green : And at the risk of being redundant, which I probably am. All of these things are about tweaking the network and the business for new demand trends and behaviors that are caused by things like business being just below and not fully recovered or new trends coming out of the pandemic. There -- it\u2019s not about there is a demand problem. So again, Southwest, we\u2019re seeing, again, record operating revenues, record passengers, record Rapid Rewards participation on revenues, record retail spend on our card, record new members, on and on and on, and we\u2019re expecting record operating revenues and passengers again in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re not generating demand. Southwest is generating a strong demand. It\u2019s about getting that aligned more precisely with the new travel patterns and also just absorbing the rapid growth that we saw because we restored our network here in the back half of the year. And that just drove sequentially more seats, more capacity than normal. And now it\u2019s time to mature that, absorb that, which is really why we\u2019re stepping down and slowing our growth rate in \u201824 so that we can take the time to do that. But I just want to point out, to me, a lot this is -- while there\u2019s work to do, a lot of this is tweaking and adjusting to the new trends. It\u2019s not about we have a demand problem. David Slotnick : And then just following up, you excluded the holidays specifically when you mentioned this during your prepared remarks. What\u2019s the booking curve looking like for that? Where do you think we are in the curve sort of right now? Ryan Green : Yes. Holiday bookings are strong. I made the comment earlier that if you look at where we sit today versus last year at this point in the curve for the December holiday period, specifically, were booked ahead, which I think is a vote of confidence that customers are beyond our operational disruption, and we\u2019re not suffering any sort of demand weakness for the December holiday period. And I would just characterize the Thanksgiving period as strong as well. We\u2019ve got a lot of capacity here over the -- in the fourth quarter that we\u2019ll have to absorb. But I\u2019m pleased with how the holidays are booking. Operator : And our next question comes from -- is a follow-up from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I appreciate the extra question. I wanted to ask, in the order book, the new order book that you laid out today, you\u2019re taking an additional aircraft -- over 200 additional aircraft over that time frame. And I wanted to see if you would comment on why you decided to do that now because it hasn\u2019t been that long since you placed an order for MAXes? Bob Jordan : Yes. Mary, I\u2019ll start and then Tammy can add on. But I think it\u2019s really about a couple of things. Again, we -- the delivery -- Boeing is a great partner. We\u2019ve all suffered supply chain and other issues. So the delivery challenges have just pushed a lot of aircraft forward, and we just want to make sure we got back through, let\u2019s clean all that up, and let\u2019s get back to where we -- the order book reflects orderly and appropriate growth. So, that\u2019s why you see a pretty normal sort of 80, 85, 90 number year to year to year to year. That was number one. Let\u2019s just clean all this up. Number two, the aircraft the new aircraft market is tight. And we want to ensure that we have access to aircraft into the future. And we\u2019ve done that through 2031. We want to make sure that we locked in very attractive pricing, which we have with Boeing, again, as a great partner, and we\u2019ve accomplished that. And then last, again, sort of -- there\u2019s been more variability in -- our industry that I think I\u2019ve ever seen. And so because of that, you just need to make sure you\u2019ve got plenty of flexibility, and that\u2019s flex up and that\u2019s flex down. If you look at the level of options and other things, we have plenty of opportunity to move those annual numbers up and down as demand dictates. So it was really -- it was as much about sort of taking the uncertainty out of the future, but also walking up access to those aircraft that attracted pricing. Tammy? Tammy Romo : Yes. You hit it all, Bob. Yes. We\u2019re very thrilled to have wrapped up our discussions with Boeing. It\u2019s everything Bob covered. And certainly, one of our key initiatives, just to add on is our fleet modernization efforts. So again, we believe this order book supports our quarterly growth plan and our fleet modernization initiative provides significant flexibility for us and also gives us a great path to retire our -700 fleet over the coming years. So, we are just thrilled to have a cost-effective order book that meets our needs going forward. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. Linda Rutherford : Thank you all for being with us. Members of the media, if you have any follow-up questions, you can obviously reach out to our communications team at 214-792-4847, or on our media website at swamedia.com. Thanks so much for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Julia Landrum : Thank you so much. And welcome everyone Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks after which, we'll be happy to take your questions. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Julia, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place, while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We are also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather, winter weather events, including the extended nationwide winter storms we experienced this month, but also with other types of disruptions such as hurricanes, severe fall in Chicago and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crude networks remain stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers. We also got fully staffed, restored our network and reached the full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year, with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on nine contracts in a little over a year, demonstrating our commitment to providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments, the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long-term. We also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance. We continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-end performance strength in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue. And we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule, where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering towards our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March. While we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures with efficiency improvements. These include everything from scheduling techniques to digital modernization and we planned in 2024 with head count flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at/or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns, ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent return is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely and we'll provide you a lot more detail later this year at Investor Day. In addition, we're working on a next seven initiatives to support -- in support of sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience, and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, 2023 wasn't without challenges, but we are stronger and ready to take on another year, and that is all thanks to our incredible employees. We delivered $996 million in profits for the year and our fourth quarter net income of $233 million, both when excluding special items, was on the better side of our expectations. We prioritize the restoration of our network and operational reliability in 2023, which has taken a lot of resources and focus. With our operations now stable and the network fully restored, we can drive much more focus in energy to consistently delivering a strong financial performance, along with delivering operational excellence. We have incredible strengths to build upon and the levers we need to optimize and regain our position as an industry leader. We will be steadfast in our efforts to make meaningful progress this year in support of our long-term goal of generating consistent returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Ryan and Andrew will cover the headway we've made with our revenue and operations performance in detail. So, I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our unit cost excluding special items, were down 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter average fuel price of $3 per gallon was right at the low end of guidance, primarily due to jet fuel prices in the L.A. market steady after significantly spiking in mid-November. Thankfully, market prices dropped as we moved into this year and our fuel price guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon for the first quarter and $2.55 to $2.65 per gallon for the full year and the welcome reduction in fuel costs compared with 2023. We are currently 60% hedged here in first quarter and 57% hedged for the full year with more meaningful hedge protection kicking in at Brent prices around $90 per barrel. That's a higher strike price than where our 2023 hedges began to provide meaningful protection, which was closer to $70 per barrel. This is reflective of the current market conditions and elevated cost of hedging. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, nearing 20% hedged and are currently 46% hedged in 2025 in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not fully immune to the volatile energy market, I am grateful that our hedging positions provide meaningful protection against catastrophic increases, while also allowing us to participate fully when market prices decline. Moving to nonfuel cost. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X decrease of 18.1% was on the favorable side of our guidance range, driven primarily by elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of the operational disruption. This was partially offset by general inflationary cost pressures, including higher labor rates for all employee work groups, as well as elevated maintenance expense. Both of which are sticky as we move into 2024. I also want to congratulate our pilots on their newly ratified contract. Obviously, the market for pilot wages has increased significantly, and it is important that we keep pace to reward our employees appropriately. As a result of the new agreement, we recorded a change in estimate for the pilot ratification bonus, and you can find the details and breakout of the accounting treatment in this morning's press release. Looking to first quarter 2024, we currently estimate our CASM-X to increase in the range of 6% to 7% year-over-year, roughly 3 to 4 points of this estimated increase is driven by higher overall 2024 labor cost and market wage rate accruals. The remainder of the first quarter CASM-X increase is primarily due to year-over-year pressure in maintenance expense, driven by rate increases as well as an increase in maintenance activity as our 800s are coming off their honeymoon period. Speaking to full year cost. Our CASM-X guidance of a 6% to 7% increase year-over-year is also essentially driven by labor and maintenance cost pressures. Roughly 4 to 5 points is attributable to labor and roughly 2 points is from maintenance for the reasons I previously covered. While we accrue for market wage rates, the recently ratified pilot contract, contributes the majority of the labor CASM-X increase this year due to a step-up in wage rates, work rule changes and enhanced benefits. As Bob mentioned, we are steadfastly focused on regaining efficiencies to help counter some of the structural cost pressures as we look to control what's controllable. We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and returns you should expect from Southwest Airlines. We have a solid 2024 plan, which includes the benefit of roughly $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profits from our strategic initiatives. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 are revenue related, contributing well over $1 billion of the $1.5 billion total expected incremental benefit. And our network optimization and market maturation efforts are providing the bulk of that revenue lift. The balance of the revenue generating benefits come from incremental managed business initiatives, primarily increased GDS participation. The incremental cost benefit relates primarily to fleet monetization and early yields from other operating efficiency efforts such as digital service modernization and our turn initiative. We will go into a lot more detail on our initiative portfolio at Investor Day later this year. While early, our plan provides significant progress towards our long-term goal to generate ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. Again, more details to come at our 2024 Investor Day. Now turning to our fleet. During 2023, we received a total of 86-8 deliveries, more than planned and retired 39-700 to less than planned, ending the year with a total of 817 aircraft. We consistently mentioned the flexibility in our fleet modernization efforts being a key competitive advantage and the minor shifting of deliveries and retirements throughout 2023 validates our ability to thoughtfully plan and execute given the continued supply chain challenges facing Boeing. Moving into 2024, there is continued uncertainty around the timing of expected Boeing deliveries and the certification of the MAX 7 aircraft. Our fleet plans remain nimble and currently differs from our contractual order book with Boeing. We are planning for 79 aircraft deliveries this year and expect to retire roughly 45-700 and 4-800, resulting in a net expected increase of 30 aircraft this year. Taking our current plan into consideration, we expect our 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. After finalizing our 2024 plans and refining capacity levels to better reflect the current environment, we now expect full year 2024 capacity to be up about 6% year-over-year. And our 2024 capacity plans do not currently include any MAX 7 flying. So, a certification of that aircraft continues to push out our 2024 capacity plans will not be impacted. In addition, we are also reducing our total fuel expense with our fleet modernization initiatives as we continue to bring on more fuel-efficient -8 aircraft and retire -700. We saw a nearly 3% year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency in 2023 and expect continued improvement this year. In addition to fuel savings, our fleet modernization initiative is a key component in reaching our environmental sustainability goals. Lastly, I am proud to report that our balance sheet strength continues to be a financial backbone as we move into another year. We remain the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended the year with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, returned $428 million to our shareholders through dividend payments in 2023, paid $85 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in 2023, and continue to be in a net cash position. We expect to pay a modest $29 million in debt payments this year and continue to expect interest income to well exceed our expected interest expense of $249 million in 2024. So, we are pleased to have a plan for significant financial improvement to be made this year. With some major milestones behind us, such as restoring our network, becoming fully staffed, fully utilizing our fleet and so much more, our sites are set on expanding margins and covering our cost of capital in 2024. And as I close, I'd like to sincerely thank our people for another year of hard work and dedication to the mission and vision of Southwest Airlines. I am so grateful for each and every one of you. You were truly my heroes. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Ryan Green : Thank you, Tammy, and hello everyone. Let me start by sharing that I am very pleased with the overall demand for our business, the execution from our amazing people, and the engagement of our loyal customers. Fourth quarter unit revenue finished slightly better than expectations at down 8.9% year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a strengthening of close-in revenue performance in November and December for both leisure and corporate business travel, as well as the continuation of overall strong holiday performance and market share gains from our managed business initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we saw no bookings impact from last year's operational disruption during this past holiday season, which speaks to the operational improvements we have made over the last year as well as the enduring loyalty from our customers. In addition, fourth quarter was another quarter with multiple record set, including record fourth quarter operating revenue and passenger revenue, as well as an all-time quarterly record for passengers carry. Fares also performed well in the fourth quarter, with our average passenger fare up about 2.5% year-over-year. And all-in-all, our fourth quarter operating revenues were up over $1 billion relative to fourth quarter of 2019. And while we still have work to do on our revenue performance, I remain very pleased with our progress. Looking to our full year results, we grew 2023 operating revenues nearly 10% year-over-year to a record $26 billion accompanied by record passengers, record Rapid Rewards revenue and record ancillary revenue. And speaking of records, we set operating revenue records in each quarter of the year and for the full year of 2023. As we move into 2024, we are seeing the momentum continue, and we're seeing early but highly encouraging benefits from our network optimization efforts, and we expect first quarter unit revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% when compared to the same period last year. This represents a solid sequential improvement in year-over-year unit revenue performance even when normalized for the five-point tailwind from the prior year disruption impact. In fact, our guide would imply first quarter 2024 nominal RASM to be about five points higher than our normal seasonal sequential average when compared with nominal fourth quarter of 2023 RASM. We currently have about 60% of expected bookings for first quarter already in place, slightly above normal, and we are seeing better than normal sequential RASM performance further demonstrating that our network optimization efforts are working. As we refined our capacity plans for this year, we've been able to pull in even more flying out of the shoulder periods, which we believe will be a tangible contributor in boosting our performance. While our forecast doesn't assume any material increase in demand for domestic air travel in 2024, we do have a line of sight to double-digit operating revenue growth year-over-year, driven largely by the network and initiative-driven revenue that Tammy detail. Included in that, of course, is our efforts to drive managed business. We are very pleased with the performance of our managed business initiatives and the success of our Southwest business team. In the past year, we had a solid increase in market share, more than three points in the managed business space and I'm very proud we improved our Business Travel News ranking from fourth place in the industry in 2019 to second place in 2023. We were the only carrier on the survey to receive an increased total score two years in a row while each of our competitors' scores have declined over that same period. It's another example of the progress we're making against the industry in the managed business space. Of course, we're also continuing our efforts to improve our customer experience and our Rapid Rewards program. We are seeing improved customer satisfaction scores with our Wi-Fi product as we proceed with our infrastructure investments there and more aircraft are joining the fleet every day within sea power and larger bins on board. We've made several enhancements to our award-winning Rapid Rewards program, including making it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels and we will soon be rolling out the ability to book travel with a combination of cash plus Rapid Reward points later this spring. We introduced customer bag tracking to reduce friction in our customers' travel experience and we look forward to sharing more on our larger digital hospitality modernization plan in the coming months. All of this is designed to make it easier to fly with us and give customers even more reasons to choose Southwest. As we enter 2024, we have a very solid plan that leverages the unparalleled strength of our people, our product, our loyalty program and our route network, and we look forward to delivering on continued progress towards our long-term financial goals. With that, Andrew, over to you. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by recognizing our people for their efforts in successfully managing through four different named winter storms, which was spread over 11 days and impacted a wide portion of our route network with intense weather conditions and frigid temperatures this month. These overlapping winter systems definitely put our winter operations fairness plan to the test. Overall, I'm very pleased with how well we manage the storms. The sheer magnitude of these weather systems resulted in significant cancellations, the vast majority of which were proactive on our part. Our cancellations were made 14 hours in advance on average and 70% were canceled with at least six hours in advance. As you can imagine, providing that much notice improves the customer experience. In fact, we have found that it can result in MPS scores that approximate, those with customers with no disruption to their itinerary. Overall cancellation rates were in line with the industry and were primarily isolated to the operations directly impacted by the storms. With fewer than 2% of our cancellations tied to crew scheduling challenges. This is a significant contrast to what we experienced with winter storm Elliott in December 2022. The improvement is directly the result of last year's winter operations investments and protocols. I echo Bob's sentiments that we are in a much better spot today than a year ago. In the past year, we not only completed the winter operations preparedness plan, we also delivered on a long list of initiatives to modernize our operation with benefits for both our customers and our employees. Our people have the staffing, equipment, tools and infrastructure to operate safely and at pace in winter weather. The good news is that, all the hard work showed up in our operating performance. We closed out 2023 with only about 1% of our total flights canceled and we improved in basically every metric. Our completion factor, on-time performance, early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled battery, all showed substantial year-over-year improvement, which in turn led to a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score. As we enter 2024, we will focus on continuing to build on our 2023 priority of operating quality. We ranked fourth place in the 2023 Wall Street Journal Airline Quality Metrics despite several of the metrics covering the winter storm Eliot period. Our goal is to move up this ranking and ultimately be ranked number one. We will also double down on three additional priorities : bringing out operating inefficiencies increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. These are multiyear initiative-based efforts, which will begin yielding material benefits in 2025. We'll share more on these in the coming months. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating our pilots on our new contract. I'd also like to thank all the negotiating teams who have worked so hard to reach nine agreements since October of 2022. These teams work tirelessly and I am pleased we can reward employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality of life enhancements. We remain in negotiations with two union represented groups, TW555 and TW556 and we look forward to reaching agreements to reward those employees for their contributions. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you, Andrew. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up if necessary. Please go ahead with the first question. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Maybe we can start with the $1.5 billion kind of initiatives. And any chance you can share more detail there, kind of details on what the different contributing items are, and also how much visibility do you have into that? Trying to get a sense of how much of that may be in the bag, so to speak? Bob Jordan : Hey, Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then maybe Ryan can jump in. Obviously, a lot of the year-over-year improvement counts on the initiatives delivering, and I feel very confident about that. I mean, some of this is our Investor Day initiatives continuing to perform. And then on top of that, you have new things, a lot of which -- the majority of which are the network improvements, which, as you know, are in place materially beginning in March and then fully in place by early summer. And so we have a lot of confidence in, though, certainly, the Investor Day initiatives delivering. And while it's early in the quarter, we have some line of sight into, obviously, March and how will the network change and optimization is delivering, and we're on track there. It's things like -- it's basically adjusting for new demand patterns. It's adjusting -- you know what they are. The Tuesday, Wednesday, shoulder flying, those kinds of things. But no, I feel like we're on track to hit that incremental $1.5 billion. Again, most of that is revenue. About two-thirds of that is revenue related. Ryan, do you want to add anything? Ryan Green : Yes. Of the revenue initiatives there, a lot -- most of that is the network optimization and the continuing maturation of some of our development markets, development market percentage of mix continues to get more back to normal ranges by the end of 2024. So that certainly will help. And obviously, we've been able to watch those development markets mature throughout their curve here over the last few years. As it relates to the other revenue initiatives that are in place, they will continue to mature and then also provide additional benefit as we -- as the airline grows. A significant portion of that is the managed business initiatives that we've been talking about. And I'm very confident in how that those sets of initiatives continue to perform. We're definitely on track. Managed business got better in the fourth quarter from how it was performing in the third quarter, and then we're expecting another sequential improvement here in the first quarter with managed business. We can see that in place and how bookings are coming in, in January, and as we begin to get into the February booking curve here. So yes, everything that we can see, how we finished the fourth quarter and then what we can see here in the first quarter and going forward makes me very confident. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I'd love to get your thoughts on the apparent premiumization of the domestic product. Obviously, you guys are committed to a single cabin, but does that give you kind of more room to raise RASM across the product or kind of just what your response to that be? Ryan Green : Well, premium certainly is a hot topic in the industry, and it's something that we watch -- that we're watching closely. We also talk to our customers on a regular basis. This is one of the things that we continue to get their feedback on. And I think we talked about it some on the last call. As you think about premium, historically in the industry, premium revenue has been highly cyclical. This is one of those times where carriers are adding premium seats into the cabin. But when the economic cycle shifts, they're pulling seats, premium seats out of the cabin. And so as we see kind of the recovery here from the pandemic, we'll have to see how these trends persist and go forward. I think overall RASM, obviously, we follow that and how we compare relative to the industry, and we're working on working on improving that as we go forward here. I will say that ancillary revenue, the majority of which is boarding products, our early bird product as well as our upgraded boarding product is doing very well. We're having record ancillary revenue performance. And so I think, yes, we have a single cabin, but we're able to improve RASM and grow ancillary revenue through some of those boarding products as well. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey good morning everybody. Obviously, a launch of discussion about domestic capacity -- woah, sorry, I'm still there, right? Ryan Green : You're there. Jamie Baker : Yes. Sorry about that. It was probably the Temis expletive that I've ever said. Lots of discussion about domestic capacity cuts, your own and others. Just curious, though, in markets where you overlap with lower-cost competitors, have you seen any changes in how they're competing other than just the capacity cuts. I mean there's been speculation of lower OA pricing as some of those airlines try to regain profitability. I'm not seeing any of that, but it's that sort of thing that I'm asking you about. Bob Jordan : Yes, Jamie, obviously, there are -- I mean, there are probably as many moving parts right now as I've ever seen. You've got -- as Ryan talked about, you've got a focus on parts of the cabin that are outperforming our route network that are outperforming, you've got -- you've got a lot of capacity moving around in the industry right now. You've got mergers. So it's tough to tell that -- and on top of that, obviously, you've got capacity impacts due to aircraft delivery, the DTF issues, all those things. So I think it's not to tease out. My guess would be that all of those factors probably get worse across the year. The impact of those are going to continue to increase, especially as you see more impacts on capacity and aircraft due to potential Boeing impacts, obviously, the geared turbofan. So more to follow. On our end, obviously, we're focused on Southwest Airlines. I'm really pleased with 2023 and all that we got accomplished that we talked about. We ended the year a much better carrier than we were the year before. The area of course, where I'm not satisfied is our financial performance. We're running roughly four points under our cost of capital right now. And that is our focus here at Southwest, and we've got a really good plan here in '24\u2026 Operator : Pardon me. This is a conference operator. We seem to have lost connection with the speakers' location. Please stand by what we try to rejoin. [Technical Difficulty] Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We regained the audio from the speaker location. Please continue Bob Jordan : Jamie, my apologies there. I don't know where we left off. But my point is we are focused on Southwest. We're focused in 24 years on expanding margins covering our cost of capital that sets us up for a lot of momentum to then even make even more progress in 2025. And thinking about capacity for Southwest Airlines, our capacity, our CapEx, as we plan forward, will obviously take into consideration the progress we are making against those financial goals. I just want you to know that. The backdrop of the industry, I think, is going to play out here across 2024, and we'll just have to see. Jamie Baker : Okay. Helpful. And then second, you've disclosed in the past that you have seriously considered a second fleet type, but decided not to go down that path. I don't have to tell you that industry animosity towards your sole provider is obviously crescendoing, would it be unreasonable to assume your single -- your single fleet conviction might finally begin to wait from here, or is that putting words in your mouth? Bob Jordan : Yes. Well, let me just back up a second. Obviously, there's a lot going on with Boeing. I mean, the MAX 8 is a great aircraft. We're very satisfied with it. And like Boeing, we support the work of the FAA and the oversight to improve quality, address any issues because at the end of the day, better Boeing is good for Southwest Airlines. The -- we periodically look at aircraft manufacturers and aircraft types. That's something we take up routinely here at Southwest Airlines. We've done that in the past. And our focus right now is on our own fleet plan, our fleet plan with Boeing. Obviously, working with Boeing to get the MAX 7 certified. But we do take that up periodically. You also have to understand every -- I know you know this, but there isn't -- as such, there's no such thing as being able to derisk all of this. Even if you have multiple aircraft providers, say we were 50-50, you'd have 400 aircraft to one type and 400 of another type, and so an issue still creates great risk for the company. So the best thing that we can do is work with Boeing to make them an even better company, which is exactly what's happening. We've got great confidence again in the MAX 8, and we're eager to get to MAX-7, we're not in charge of that certification date. But no, we have confidence that Boeing will get all this figured out with the FAA will come out a better company. Jamie Baker : Appreciate the color. Take care everyone. Bob Jordan : Jamie, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Catherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On unit revenue going forward, underlying your double-digit top line forecast for the year. Can you just help us think about where we go from the 1Q unit revenue forecast? I'm assuming based on the full year capacity outlook growth is going to slow from the first quarter into the remaining quarters of the year. So, that would be a sequential tailwind. You'll be lapping some of that easy comp from the book away as we move through the year. How does that impact where you think unit revenue trends quarter-to-quarter. Anything else lumpy we should be considering? Tammy Romo : Yes. I'll start off and then Ryan, if you want to jump in with any thoughts you have, really, there -- as you pointed out, there's a bit of noise year-over-year. So, probably the best way to kind of help you think through that is sequentially. As you're aware, the first quarter is seasonally a tougher quarter just in general for the airline industry. And we will have our network changes materially in place in March. So, -- and then following on into the summer, we expect to have that fully completed with our summer schedules. And then just as we continue to go through the year, we would expect our development markets to continue to mature, you're aware 10% of our system is development market. And by the end of the year, we expect that to be more in line with our historical percentage of about, call it, 5%. And then on top of that, as Ryan covered, we are -- we believe we'll continue to grow our managed business revenue. We've been with our GDS initiative, and we would expect those benefits to steadily improve as we go through the year. So, we would expect -- we've got a lot of momentum coming into this year. We would expect that to continue and [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Pardon me. This is a conference operator. We've again lost audio from the speaker location. Please standby as we try to regain it. Thank you. This is the conference operator. We've regained audio from the speaker's location. Please continue. Thank you. Bob Jordan : And everybody, sorry about it. We're having some form of conference call issue here, my apologies. But I would just pile on just simply, maybe talk -- cover what Tammy did, which is you have decelerating capacity across the year. 10% Q1, 8% to 10% in the second quarter, 3% to 5% in the third quarter. And then the back half of the year, really is all just [indiscernible]. Trips are down, seats are down. On top of that, the initiatives and particularly the network related revenue initiatives and the development market related initiatives accelerate because they really started in March, accelerated on the summer. So you have decreasing capacity across the year, and you have an accelerated contribution from the network initiatives across the year. That's an indirect answer to your question, but that's how I'm thinking about it. Ryan Green : Yeah. And I wouldn't add anything else, other than to say that the revenue initiatives, that component of the plan, those are -- there's very little lumpiness in those as well. Those are pretty evenly spread throughout the year. So it's really about the decelerating capacity in the back half of the year and the network maturation and optimization efforts coming on. Catherine O'Brien: Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just for my second question. Would just like to talk about the unit cost side for this year, and I know very early, but maybe first 2025. Can you talk to us just about like some of the incremental headwinds you're expecting for 2024 versus what you were thinking back earlier in 2023 when you're targeting unit costs to be down year-over-year, of course, at least a couple of points that lower capacity. The pilot contract came in higher. It would be great if you could just walk us from that, down year-over-year to up $6 million to $7 million. And then, again, early, but into 2025, if we lap the big step up in wages or back to something more inflationary plus, I'm guessing you're going to get more efficiency back as you go into year two of the network recovery in your optimization phase, like is that when we get the down year-over-year? Any color there would be great. Thanks so much for the time. Bob Jordan : Thank you, and I'll start, and then I'm sure Tammy you will pile in. I mean the -- we were accrued for our labor contract increases here. We've got nine done, two to go it's really, for the most part, it's rate increases here in 2024. So if you take the pilots, for example, they've got a 4% rate increase. We've got some benefit increases. That's the majority of the $6 million to $7 million. On top of that, you have maintenance pressure that was known. It's really the 800 engines coming off holiday and that's a couple of points. Those are going to be things, wage rate pressure, maintenance pressure that most of the industry shares. Now on the efficiency side, as we go across the year, we've peaked our hiring, and we will -- our target is to end the year in 2024 with fewer heads than we ended the year 2023, which will, of course, naturally make us more efficient for the 7% growth. It\u2019s too early to talk about 2025. But as you maybe think about a forecast there, yeah, you would naturally decelerate from the unit cost pressure this year. And our goal, we're not ready to give you a number, of course, for 2025, but our goal will be to dramatically control that headcount growth again in 2025. And we'll be sharing a lot more about that at our Investor Day later in the year. Tammy, if you want to add anything? Tammy Romo : Yeah, you really covered it all. But yeah, the story is actually quite simple is labor cost, labor rate cost, obviously, the inflation there is more than we would have anticipated initially. So we've -- with the pilot contract, behind us. We've adjusted our accruals. So most of 2024 is associated with the step -- with the step up in scale increases, wage rate increases and enhanced benefits and Bob covered the maintenance, and we'll share more at Investor Day, but obviously, we're focused on bringing out those efficiencies as we move through 2024 and to a greater degree in 2025. Catherine O'Brien: Thanks so much. Tammy Romo : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Appreciate the time. So, maybe just one more shot at this. Can you give us your best guess as to the contributors to the sequential improvement here? How much of that five points would you attribute to these network realignment initiatives? And how much would you attribute to just better underlying demand? It's been challenging with airlines to really make a read about the macro based on what airlines are doing in any given quarter. Just like in the third quarter of last year, I didn't think that was a particularly good read on the macro. But if you just look at this revenue outlook here, what is your business telling you about the macro? And are you seeing acceleration and if so, where? Ryan Green : Yeah, Duane, it's Ryan. I think the macro environment for demand overall is very strong. I mean the way that we closed the fourth quarter, we saw a close-in performance kind of accelerate in the holiday time period which had us -- we came in above our expectations at that point. So I think that, that was a good sign as we got into the year. And as you sit here in the first quarter, the beginning of the first quarter, we've got about 60% of bookings on hand. That's plenty for us to get a good read on how the macro trends are performing. I think demand looks very strong in January and February, which are typically trough periods here. We're performing just fine. As you look into the stronger periods into March, I think spring break travel and the Easter travel period, that's looking very well. And then probably also, as it relates to the overall macro environment, if you just look at managed business trends. I think I mentioned this earlier, fourth quarter was better than third quarter and first quarter is expected to be better than the fourth. We've got very strong bookings in place on the managed business side here for February as we begin to get into that part of the curve. So I think the overall macro environment sets up well for us having a really good year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just a follow-up there. Any focus cities or parts of the country that are kind of waking back up for you? Ryan Green : Well, I would say destination-based markets are doing very well. International is doing very well. Hawaii, we beat our expectations in the fourth quarter. Phoenix, Orlando, Vegas, those markets are doing very well for us. I think when you look, California was slower to come back, it's doing -- it's improving for sure. So it's definitely pockets across the network. But again, I think overall, things continue to improve. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. So can I come back, I think, to the first Q&A here, which was about the premiumization of the industry. Because I think what we did observe through 2023 was some growing yield differential between yourself and maybe some low-cost competitors relative to the network airlines. And I guess I just want to ask the question maybe more bluntly or directly. Does products matter in does it matter as you go further in distance and longer in flight length? And I guess I'd specifically ask about your experience in Hawaii as well. And I guess how do these initiatives that you guys are talking about on the commercial side start to try to address that? Thank you. Ryan Green : Well, first of all, I would say, absolutely product matters. And I think that certainly from a coach product, Southwest Airlines has the best coach product in the industry. I would just echo what I said on the premium component of this is highly cyclical. And I think that we want -- before we would take up that question, you would want to -- or we would want to study that very closely as we think about that. Your question on how do we do relative in a long-haul market like Hawaii, as I mentioned, we beat expectations. We beat our own expectations for Hawaii in the fourth quarter. I think our yields continue to improve, and the Mainland to Hawaii component of that franchise. And we'll continue to develop those yields further. But no, I think that our product fares very well even in long-haul markets. But yes, on the whole, I think product matters. And I think when you look at the industry together, I think that there's at least some evidence out there today that demand for fares on the bottom end and lower products on the lower end of the segment, there may not be as much demand for those types of products today as what their once was. Bob Jordan : And Brandon, this is Bob. The only thing I would add is -- and this is no prediction don't read more into this than is there. You've got to meet your customers' demand and their expectations. So as those change over time, you want to understand that. You want to be -- you want to carefully understand that. And we have a history of demonstrating that. So you go back 10 years, we wouldn't have been talking about Wi-Fi. We would not have been talking about power on the aircraft. And you can go on and on and on. There was a time when we didn't even have a loyalty program here at Southwest Airlines. So as consumer demands and expectations change and you've got different generations of flyers coming into the system as well. We will constantly look at that, understand what our customers want. And then if that warrants change, we will look at that, and we will make the right decision. Again, we have a history of doing that with our product here and our customer experience. That's no predictor regarding premium in the cabin. I'm just trying to make sure that you know that we aren't stubborn in this area that as you see demands change, we'll understand that and we will react if needed. Brandon Oglenski : Bob and Ryan, I appreciate that. And then maybe if I can just get a quick follow-up for Tammy. Any ability to tell us where you view your weighted cost of capital today? Tammy Romo : Yes, sure. It's sitting probably -- it's the high 8s, close between 8% and 9%. So we view it as about 8.6%, 8.7%. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that Tammy. Tammy Romo : But one thing, Brandon, just to add on, over our longer term, it's been closer to 9%. We certainly take a view, a longer-term view when we're planning in terms of our returns on invested capital. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the time. As I look at your numbers for the fourth quarter, your revenues were up at 12.5% or something and your costs were up 10.5% and yet you weren't able to see significant margin improvement because of the things you already talked about where you have inflationary pressure. But as we look forward to the next one year, how should we think about the seasonality of your business now? Because it seems like you said everything was great for the fourth quarter, and yet you didn't perform significantly better than you did last year, and I would have thought that last year, given all the issues, you would have performed a lot better. So maybe you can help me bridge beyond just the obvious labor cost inflation and other inflationary pressures, how you get back to those margins you used to report? And then do you expect -- and then my other question is, do you expect any book away from the flight attendant asking for a strike vote. Bob Jordan : Yes. Maybe Helane, thank you. Maybe I can start and... Helane Becker : That was a lot of question. Bob Jordan : Yes, I'll try to remember everything. I think just generally, I think the biggest impact, sort of tearing everything aside in the fourth quarter is we did choose to restore capacity quickly. So basically, that was a choice to number one, get our aircraft back to normal utilization, fly all our aircraft, our pilots, all that. And so our capacity, our ramp-up was greater than normal, and therefore, we did have -- you could see it, we had a drop in load factor. I think that's the biggest contributor in terms of the performance rate there that's different than normal. And our '24 plan, obviously, is to get back to normal in that area as we normalize capacity. So to me, that's the biggest thing. And I don't attribute any of that. I'll get to your flight attendant question. We don't -- I don't attribute any of that to book away in the holidays, for example, related to Elliot or something like that. I think it really was the rate of capacity restoration. As we look at our consumer -- our customer behaviors, we look at our customer metrics, demand for Southwest Airlines, there's no indicator or indication that we saw any hangover or book away. In fact, the holiday periods were the strongest periods of the quarter. Your question about the flight attendant, and I'm really proud of our labor folks. We ratified nine agreements in just over a year. We have two to go, one of those with TW 556 are flight attendants. We were at federal mediation. And in federal mediation, you follow the mediator, and the mediator determines your dates and when you meet and we're eager to get a contract done. And just like our pilots who are in mediation, I'm confident we can do that. The SAV or the strike vote does not mean you are headed to a strike. There are many, many, many things that have to occur before we get to that point. So, I'm not worried about a strike despite the strike authorization vote. When we saw our pilots, I take an SAV or strike authorization vote. We did not see any very little customer even indicator that the customers were focused on it or aware. So I don't expect any kind of hangover from that here in terms of customer demand with -- because of the flight attendant vote. Ryan, do you want to add anything there? Ryan Green : No, there's no evidence in anything that we track from a customer sentiment perspective that would make us concerned about that. Bob Jordan : That sentiment is fully recovered to at this point. And our NPS scores, our customer satisfaction have recently have been records and certainly back to pre-pandemic levels. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. We'll take that last question from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess on efficiency and further improvement to come in 2025, for investors that want -- or that would like line of sight on where FTEs per aircraft could ultimately go, what prior year could serve as a good benchmark. I guess that's first. And then secondly, is that reasonable to assume Southwest could get there fully in 2025. Bob Jordan : Yes, I'll answer directly and add Andrew, if you want to chime in. I think we're not ready to talk about that in maybe as much detail as you want until we get to our Investor Day here later this year. But absolutely, it's just like the goal of covering our cost of capital this year, and getting back to our historic returns and ROIC well above WACC, restoring efficiency is right alongside in terms of the key goal or a key goal. We ramped up our hiring quickly to be able to restore the network and get all of our aircraft flying. That hiring peaked in October to November, and we have been decelerating that rapidly here in the last 60 days. The plan is to, again, to grow six-or-so percent this year and then to end this year with the same or fewer heads than we began the year, which will obviously help our efficiency quite a bit. Not ready to discuss 2025, but we would have certainly a directionally similar goal in 2025. We also have a significant number to hate to tease here. We have a significant number of efficiency initiatives that we are planning around both efficiency of the aircraft, efficiency of our people and processes as we think about things like the turn, and we'll be sharing a lot more about that again in our Investor Day later this year. Andrew Watterson : I'd say, Bob, one element to that on that is the same kind of cross-functional groups we use to kind of rapidly accelerate our hiring that same team is now responsible for driving up these efficiencies. So that is something that is literally every week kind of needing to get to achieve what you just said about where the headcount split at the end of the year. And I'd also say that while we're conscious of the FTE per aircraft, we're actually managing a lever or squib CASM because if you think about aircraft, I could fly that different ways. We could say you'd have two flights a day and my ground obviously needs a different fluids six times a day. And then the block hours for the aircraft would change pilot pay, if it was a longer block hours per aircraft or less further less. So the ultimate CASM you get out of your aircraft depends on how you're flying it and how you're deploying staff against it. So the FTE per aircraft is a useful measure can have, but it's A, hard to compare across the airlines because of the outsourcing, but B, dependent on how you fit the aircraft it and give some -- a little bit of false signal, but you can really look at what we're going to try to do for the labor CASM and get that to a good order. Dan McKenzie : Very good. And if I could just squeeze 1 last 1 in here. It's a question on the shift to the cloud. How much of Southwest has shifted to the cloud at this point? And once you complete that endeavor, what could the savings ultimately look like once that transition is completed? Is it tens of millions, hundreds of millions? And is that an opportunity? Bob Jordan : I'd tell you what, you're stretching my technical abilities here, but I believe like a lot of companies, we have a path to shift to the cloud. But again, it's to shift the appropriate things to the cloud. It's not as simple as it might sound. I think we have shifted something on the order of just below 50% is what I've got in my head, and we have a goal to shift a lot more. Some of that is cost savings, absolutely. And -- but I think that is more modest. A lot of what you gain is reliability. And the ability to fail over systems and obviously support operations, support our systems, which is critical here in an airline. You have systems that can't be down 30 minutes cause you an operational problem. So, a lot of the shift to the cloud is as much a resiliency effort and a modernization of the code base and all that effort as it is a cost savings. Certainly, you'll see cost savings. And -- but I just don't -- not my guess is it's more in the tens of millions than it is hundreds of millions Andrew Watterson : I think, Bob, we -- I mean, fraction side it used to be very good progress. But when we talk about it internally, we're not talking so much of the cost you can take a hosted bigger system, breakup in micro services that are in the cloud and allows you to then get productivity and how you refresh and improve that application over time. So, it's really the speed to market for these new products and support the products is really what drives the benefit. So, it's elsewhere in the business, you get the benefit not so much any kind of hosted costs, if you will. Bob Jordan : The other lease of that, too, and then we'll -- I'll stop is the -- there is a -- it's not a tech cost, but there is a very high cost, both revenue and expense and being down and having an issue. And you saw issues earlier this year or last year, like the NOTAM outage that really hurt the industry. And so to the extent that you can reduce issues, reduce the number of the issues, the length of time of an issue or reduce them completely. My guess is that is more powerful in terms of cost reduction than even the technology reduction because reducing IROPs is very powerful. Dan McKenzie : Very good. Thanks so much for the time guys. Bob Jordan : Dan, thank you. Julia Landrum : Okay. That completes the analyst portion of our call. A quick reminder that the transcript and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations' website. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, Gary. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Gary, could you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to see what you made of a center of Duckworth today calling on the FAA to deny the waiver Boeing of Sox to MAX 7. Is that anti-ice issue, do you think that something Boeing should have to address before they can start delivering those planes? Bob Jordan : I'll start, and Andrew, you'll file in, Ali. Obviously, the certification of the MAX 7 and the issue there, that's really Boeing. I don't want to speak for Boeing or get ahead here. Obviously, we want the MAX 7 and we want it on the best timing possible. So I don't want to talk for Boeing, but it is one more thing to consider here in the certification process and certification time line. Andrew Watterson : I would say that the certification is a technical process between the FAA and Boeing. And I think they've been doing a good job. It's been slower than we would like, but it's been technically based and it's off a public comment. So it's an opportunity for people to comment on that for technical analysis to be done. And so we're not a party to that. We want the aircraft. It's a question of when we'll get it, not if we'll get it. So we're pleased that they're taking their time to make sure it's safe and we support whatever way the FA wants to go. Alison Sider : And I mean do you have any plans to increase your own oversight of Southwest Plans on the Boeing production line? Andrew Watterson : We have already done that. So in late 2022, we changed our posture up there. Previously, we had for a long time, they have representatives at the factory. We increased it to a team of AMP license mechanics, whose job is to provide oversight of our aircraft in the production process. The Boeing provides customer quality people that are on their payroll, but our direction. And so they inspect at places where we ask in the factory the few days that Boeing takes to assemble an aircraft from the wings being built to rolling out. It's about roughly 80 areas where we have our requirements for things to be expected. Those people inspect -- our people inspect. And then several times a year, our quality assurance team goes up and inspect our inspectors to make sure everything is going well. So that provides a really good oversight in the production process once it leaves the factory, there's a customary acceptance in spectrums that happened the FAA overseas and give a final certificate of air worthiness. And then it comes on to our ops spec and we in our maintenance program, which is quite robust. And since we're by far the largest operator of the 737, we have provided lots of data and our continuing analysis and safety surveillance system allows for us to really understand the aircraft and make sure that it's performing and conforming as expected. Alison Sider : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead. Leslie Josephs : Hi. I was wondering if you have any thoughts about how a Chapter 7 of an airline in the United States would affect the industry? Are there jobs for those employees should that happen? And then do you think that the Justice Department would ever let you buy another airline? Bob Jordan : Hey, Leslie, it's Bob. We don't -- obviously, like I said earlier, there is a lot going on in the industry. They're between merger potential mergers and acquisitions and issues with aircraft deliveries, the geared turbofan, I don't know in my 36 years in the industry. I've seen more moving parts as you have right now. One thing that's consistent here is we stick to our business. So we're focused on Southwest Airlines, improving Southwest Airlines being the best carrier that we can be improving our returns and profit and margins, all the things that we've talked about. It's impossible to speculate on what might happen. Our history would say that as opportunities arise for Southwest, if they make sense, we take a look at that. But I wouldn't want to speculate on anything going on in the industry, certainly around any other carrier. Andrew Watterson : I think with the benefit for Southwest Airlines, Bob, is that we have a plan and we control our destiny. We hit our plan, we get our returns where we need to be. We don't need something to break our way to judge or anything else or rule anything. Our plan delivers our results. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Please go ahead. Rajesh Singh : Hi. Andrew, do you have any update on the time line for certification of MAX 7. Earlier, it was expected by April. So do you see any risk of the certification process getting slowed down due to the current events with Boeing? Andrew Watterson : Well, we get weekly updates on the status of the certification process. So we know what's been submitted and what hasn't. But obviously, then the FAA is the one who oversees that and inspect it makes ultimate decision previously, we've indicated that we had -- in our internal plan and assumption that it would be certified by April and that we would then spend time after of that. I think on our of spec that could take us at the end of the year, and therefore, it would be flat until next year. But that is -- that was only the latest assumption. We've had earlier assumptions all along this process. And as Tammy mentioned, we will modify our plan based on the new information. So should that change, we will move our assumptions and adapt our plan. So by this kind of conservative approach and giving ourselves the lead time, we won't let any kind of short-term ups or downs affect what we have planned for this year. Rajesh Singh : And Bob, I have question for you. Do you have confidence in Boeing's currently sit to address place who's facing the company? Bob Jordan : Hey, Rajesh, Boeing has been a partner with us for 52 years. And I have absolute confidence that between the FAA oversight work that's going on, the work that Boeing is doing that Boeing will working with the FAA will address the quality issues, and we'll obviously come out of this a better company. I've talked personally to their leadership. They're committed to doing anything and everything it takes to be better and to address the problems. And as I said before, a better Boeing is very good for Southwest Airlines. So yeah, I have absolute confidence that they will work their way through this and address the issues. Rajesh Singh : Thank you. Bob Jordan : Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Eichinger for any closing remarks. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, Gary. The news release and our contact information are available at swamedia.com. We thank everyone for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] Now Mrs. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you so much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks, after which we will be happy to take your questions. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. As we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release, so please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob. Robert Jordan : Thank you, Julia. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Well, let me state right up front that I am disappointed with our first quarter performance. There are a lot of factors that I'll go into, and there's a lot to cover, including the latest Boeing challenges. More importantly, there are significant efforts and progress underway as we cannot and we won't be satisfied until we are delivering the kind of returns you expect from Southwest Airlines. So before I go any further, I just want to sincerely thank our people for their extraordinary efforts as we work quickly to drive improvement. Turning to our performance. We achieved records for first quarter operating revenues and passengers, continuing our streak of 8 straight quarters of record top line performance. We saw a nice acceleration in managed business revenues, up 25% nominally year-over-year. We also continued our streak of solid operational performance. For a while now, we have been consistently running a great completion factor averaging right around 99%, and we continue to improve in nearly all operational and customer metrics. I'm also proud of the progress we made on our open labor agreements. It's been a long road, and I want to recognize everyone involved for continuing to work through to the finish line to reward our amazing employees for their contributions. Ryan will go into our revenue performance in more detail in a moment. And while our revenue trends were solid in the first quarter and are expected to be a solid year again in the second quarter, we need to increase revenue production to offset cost inflation. The biggest opportunity to improve performance and profitability and urgency is continued focus on network optimization and capacity. We opened 18 new cities during the pandemic and worked hard in 2023 to restore our network and fly our full fleet on the heels of the demand surge in 2022. While that boosted aircraft utilization, it added significant capacity. And when combined with 2023 business travel coming in below projections, has resulted in a significant number of new markets under development and a material number of markets that are not performing at the level required in this higher cost environment. Network adjustments planned last fall are in place as of the March schedule, and they are proving to be largely on track. Those optimization efforts were primarily aimed to adjust for changing demand trends, including lower capacity on Tuesday and Wednesday, a reduction in short-haul business markets and a material reduction in flights during shoulder periods of the day. The changes are beneficial, and they contributed to us exiting the first quarter with healthy margins for the month of March. More is needed, and we are continuing efforts to optimize the network and reduce the number of markets in development that aren't performing to more historic levels. Along those lines, we have made the difficult decision to eliminate service in 4 cities : Syracuse, New York; Houston Intercontinental; Cozumel; and Bellingham, Washington. That is never an easy decision. We form bonds with the airports and the communities that we serve. These are wonderful communities, and we are very grateful for their support over the past several years. In addition, we are also restructuring several other stations. Most notably, we are reducing flights in Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare. While it's never our desire to exit a city or shrink service to a market, we are committed to our financial performance goals, and network and capacity actions will continue as a lever to improve overall financial performance. In addition to network optimization, we have a number of other efforts underway to increase revenue productivity. First, tuning our new revenue management system by better anticipating and optimizing demand and fares along the booking curve and unlocking additional capabilities that will further boost the contribution from the system. Second, focusing on increasing passenger volume, including adding new attributes to our value proposition. We are working to ensure our current and future customers understand our terrific value proposition. That includes a significant new brand campaign, which started last week, highlighting our signature customer-friendly policies. Separately, we are considering more transformational options and follow-on initiatives. That includes work previously underway to study customer preference around seating and our cabin. It's been several years since we last studied this in-depth, and customer preferences and expectations change over time. We are also studying the operational and financial benefits of any potential change. We remain committed to our industry-best, customer-friendly policies, but we are also committed to understanding and meeting customer expectations. We have transformed before, adding things like WiFi, larger bins and in-seat power, and we will continue to adapt as needed. It is too early to share the specifics of what we are exploring, but I want to be transparent and let you know that work is well underway. Of course, the biggest change we have experienced is the news from Boeing on deliveries. The Boeing issues are a significant impact, and we are taking quick action to replan based on expected 2024 and 2025 delivery delays. As I've said before, while it's impactful, I support Boeing taking the time to do the work to understand and fix the issues. A stronger Boeing company for the long term is good for Southwest Airlines. I visited Boeing in late March. And while there is much work to do, I am encouraged by the comprehensive approach that their leadership is taking. I will be back at Boeing this summer when they complete their plan, and I will be visiting Spirit AeroSystems as well. I won't downplay the challenges from the Boeing issues. They are a big deal and contribute to changing capacity set. They're redoing schedules and forecasting now in accurate staffing levels. All of that is costly. It pulls people away from their regular work, and it creates a significant financial drag. That said, it won't deter from our work to improve our results. We will continue to control what we can control and work our plan as they take the time to become a better Boeing company. Boeing issues aside, we already had aggressive plans in place to further optimize the network to improve profitability, moderate CapEx and capacity to improve free cash flow and ROIC and drive staffing and operational actions to improve efficiency. All of that work is now being accelerated. As we continue our focus on capital efficiency, free cash flow generation and aggressively restoring our returns, we will continue to moderate both capacity and CapEx until we do so. Managing our CapEx is obviously key to improving free cash flow, which, along with ROIC, we are laser-focused on. Our bias will remain to retire aircraft, as planned. And any capacity growth that we have in the near term will come entirely from gauge and initiatives to drive aircraft utilization, including tightening turn time through process innovation and automation, and introducing a modest level of red eye flying. Both of those initiatives boost aircraft utilization and create capacity without aircraft CapEx. The initiative to reduce turn time is going well. And as a first step, 12 stations will see a 5-minute reduction in turn time in the November 2024 schedule, with further reductions in early 2025. We will share details on the full plan, which includes these and other planned strategic initiatives at our Investor Day, now planned for September 26, and I look forward to welcoming everyone here to Dallas. On our cost control efforts, note that we already had plans in place to end 2024 with head count flat to down through efficiency efforts like deploying automation and Gen AI solutions for greater productivity and some customer support functions, and driving organizational efficiency by combining like functions. Further capacity reductions in 2024 and 2025 create additional head count and efficiency challenges, and we are moving quickly to address those through a combination of voluntary programs. We have essentially frozen and stopped all hiring, except for a limited number of critical positions, and now expect to end 2024 with head count down approximately 2,000 as compared to the end of 2023. Head count will be down again in 2025 through continued efficiency efforts. We are already seeing the benefits of time off without pay program that, in fact, the participation in these programs generated higher-than-expected savings in March, which was one of the factors that contributed to us beating our first quarter CASM-X guidance. Last quarter, we laid out a plan that included providing a line of sight to cover our cost of capital in 2024. We are admittedly materially off that plan. Much of the miss comes from external factors, including headwinds from increased market prices for fuel and impacts attributable to the most recent delays in Boeing deliveries, but we aren't accepting that as our fate and are taking swift action against what we can control. So there's a lot going on right now, and we have a good grip and plan around areas of the business where we can improve. As a recap, we are continued to be guided by our goals to drive ROIC performance by making additional network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets and adjusting capacity, enhancing revenue performance in the intermediate term through marketing and revenue management efforts, offsetting cost pressures with efficiency initiatives and programs to reduce head count and lower discretionary spending, curbing our capacity plans and managing down CapEx and investing in initiatives that create capacity without capital investment. And finally, by creating a new set of strategic initiatives to share with you at our Investor Day this September, we will not tolerate underperformance of any kind, and everyone is committed to doing what it takes. I am truly blessed to lead the company with such passionate and dedicated employees, and I am confident that we can and will adjust as needed, as we have in the past, and work to hit our financial targets, which are not negotiable. So before I close, I just want to say thank you again to our employees for all that they do every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy for a more in-depth review of our financial performance and outlook. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob just covered, this year is not shaping up as we had initially planned. We have never, and will never, accept underperformance. There are a lot of things that contributed to our current position, the impact of continued delivery delays from Boeing, significant market-driven inflationary pressure from new labor contracts, volatile fuel prices and dynamic customer travel patterns. Those are all very real reasons, but we will not use them as excuses. Instead, our focus is to control what we can control, to take aggressive actions, to adapt as required and to produce financial returns, period. Bob mentioned the warrior spirit of our employees. It's a very real thing, and it will be the key to our turnaround. So before I dive in, I want to thank our incredible employees for their resilience, their perseverance and their dedication as we gear up to tackle the challenge we have before us. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance in detail, so I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our unit cost, excluding special items, increased modestly, less than 1% year-over-year in first quarter. Our first quarter average fuel price of $2.92 per gallon came in a bit below our guidance range. Market prices have been volatile. And based on the April 18 market, we increased our full year fuel price guidance by roughly $0.15 to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon, and we're anticipating our second quarter fuel price to fall within that range as well. We are currently 55% hedged here in the second quarter and 58% hedged for the full year. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, now 26% hedged, and are currently 47% hedged in 2025. Our treasury team continues to do a great job managing our program as we see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio, with the continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection in each calendar year. The purpose of our hedge is to provide protection from spikes when we need it most. Over the past 2 years, we have benefited significantly from our hedge portfolio, generating net settlement gains of $872 million and $145 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. For our 2024, we are currently expecting only a very modest loss, but as Brent gets above $90 a barrel, our position would begin to materially kick in that obviously is helpful insurance to have in this volatile environment. Moving to nonfuel cost. Our first quarter unit cost, excluding special items, were up 5% year-over-year in first quarter. Of course, that was primarily driven by pressure from new labor agreement and an increase in planned maintenance associated with the -800s coming off their engine honeymoon. This was a point ahead of our previous expectations, primarily from favorable airport settlements, but also from some early benefits from our cost control initiatives, like voluntary time-off programs. I am very thankful to all the employees who are pitching in to help reduce costs. It's always been part of our culture. And the contributions that our people are making across the company are a sign that our culture is alive and well. Throughout first quarter, we were reacting and adjusting to continuous information from Boeing on further aircraft delivery delays, causing some additional movement within our CASM-X guidance expectations as we quickly worked to revise our 2024 plans. While Boeing's challenges continue to significantly impact us, I am immensely proud of the way our team continues to handle such a dynamic situation, running multiple forecasting scenarios for critical decision support, including support in adjusting capacity and reoptimizing the network. Looking to second quarter and full year 2024, we continue to expect similar cost pressures throughout the year, driven primarily by elevated labor costs and maintenance expenses. We currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year and our full year CASM-X to increase in the range of 7% to 8% year-over-year, elevated from our previous full year CASM-X guidance due to lower capacity plans in the second half of the year. The estimated sequential change in nominal CASM-X from first to second quarter is largely in line with historical norms when adjusted for capacity levels. Roughly 5 points of our full year CASM-X guidance is attributable to elevated salaries, wages and benefits expense and roughly 1 point is due to elevated maintenance and materials expense. While we continue to expect pressure from maintenance costs this year, we have reworked our maintenance plans given our new delivery expectations, and we now expect lower full year 2024 maintenance expense compared with our previous expectations. We are also planning more voluntary leave and time-off programs to further reduce labor expenses and address current overstaffing. Despite these added pressures, which are a direct result of the Boeing aircraft delivery delays, we are aggressively working to control costs, reduce inflationary pressures and cut discretionary spending across all cost categories. I want to reiterate, we are far from satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we return to financial prosperity with our North Star being ROIC well exceeding our cost of capital. We will go into a lot more detail on our plans at Investor Day in September of this year. Now turning to our fleet. We have reacted quickly over the quarter to the updated Boeing delivery delays. We began the quarter with the expectation we'd receive 79 of our 85 contractual deliveries in 2024. That number dropped to an expected 46 -8 aircraft at the timing of our March 8-K, and has since reduced even further to a conservatively planned 20 -8 aircraft deliveries. Thus far, we have received 5 -8 aircraft from Boeing during the first quarter and have retired 3 -700 aircraft from our fleet. To reduce distractions and impacts to the business and hedge against further potential delivery delays, we will now plan to hold on to an additional 14 -700 aircraft that were originally planned to retire this year, bringing our expected 2024 total retirements down to 35 aircraft, including 4 -800 lease returns compared with our previous expectation for 49 aircraft retirements. While we remain committed to our fleet modernization, we feel it is prudent to retain some flexibility until we have better certainty around our aircraft deliveries and around the certification of the MAX-7. The updated Boeing delivery expectations has also impacted our capital expenditures and cash flow expectations for the year. As a result of the 20 expected aircraft deliveries, we currently expect our capital spending to be approximately $2.5 billion, well below our previous guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Keep in mind, our 2024 CapEx guidance includes an estimate for progress payments based on our current contractual order book. And CapEx estimates will be fluid until we finish working our plans and aligning on updated expectations for actual 2025 deliveries, which we plan to share at our Investor Day this fall. A quick note on our capacity plans. The Boeing delivery delays did not impact our first quarter capacity, finishing up 11% year-over-year on solid completion factor. Looking ahead, as we rework our capacity plans for the year, we now expect second quarter capacity to be up in the range of 8% to 9% year-over-year. The majority of the Boeing capacity cuts will occur over the second half of the year, with third quarter capacity expected to increase in the low single digits and fourth quarter capacity expected to decrease in the low to mid-single digits, placing our full year 2024 capacity up approximately 4% all year-over-year. Looking beyond 2024, we plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach our long-term financial goals to consistently achieve ROIC well above our cost of capital. As a reminder, our aircraft delivery and retirement expectations are subject to Boeing's production capability. And we will react as quickly as possible if any further adjustments are needed, with the focus on taking care of our customers and aligning with our financial goals. Lastly, I am immensely grateful for our balance sheet strength as we move through another challenging year. We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with a nearly $1 billion reduction from the prior quarter, driven by the payout of a labor agreement ratification bonuses, which are onetime in nature. In addition, we returned $215 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, and paid $8 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations. Finally, and most notably, I am proud to report we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. Both Moody's and Fitch affirmed our rating during first quarter, and S&P reviewed and left our rating unchanged. As ever, maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet is our utmost priority. As I close, I want to reiterate that we are not starting the year as we had hoped, and that is undeniably disappointing. However, throughout my years at this wonderful company, I have come to know that a better Southwest is often formed on the heels of adversity. I agree with Bob, that is all because of the fight and warrior spirit of our people. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Ryan Green : Thank you, Tammy. As Bob mentioned, I'm going to provide you with details on our first quarter revenue performance and base trends. I'll also share an outlook for the second quarter and full year, along with what we are assuming in the guide. And most importantly, I will give you some color on the additional actions we are taking to further improve our revenue performance. Starting with first quarter. Unit revenue finished roughly flat on 11% capacity growth, both on a year-over-year basis. The variance to our original guidance is driven by a balance of higher-than-expected completion factor, closed-in leisure volumes that came in below our expectations in the month of March and underperformance in select development markets. Development markets as a portfolio did not meet the maturation expectations, but the story isn't the same for all markets. Several development markets outperformed expectations, particularly Florida Beach destinations. But a few markets weighed down the portfolio. As Bob shared, we have made the difficult decision to address underperforming stations with closures effective August 4 and also to restructure and reduce capacity in other underperforming markets, which are included in our updated June schedule. Despite coming in below our expectations, first quarter had strong demand, setting numerous records, including record first quarter operating revenue, ancillary revenue passenger revenue and record first quarter passengers carried, and we also added a quarterly record number of new Rapid Reward members into the program. In addition to these records, we were also really pleased to see the continued incremental benefits from our investments in managed business as first quarter managed business revenue grew 25% year-over-year and was roughly flat to 2019 levels. We continue to pick up market share year-over-year as we perform in line with or above the rest of the industry. Finally, from a geographical perspective, we saw the strongest year-over-year improvements coming from the West Coast and the Northeast, regions where demand has been slower to return post-COVID. I also want to stress that we had a better than historically normal sequential trend in nominal unit revenue. We are seeing improvement in revenue productivity and demand. Nominal RASM in the first quarter came in flat to fourth quarter, despite first quarter historically being seasonally softer than fourth quarter. And this is particularly true in a post-COVID environment, where peaks and troughs are magnified. To illustrate this point, consider 2018 the most recent year in which Easter fell in the last weekend of March. Nominal RASM declined sequentially 5 points. So even in this seasonally challenged quarter, the sequential performance was much better than our best holiday comparison. The most significant driver of this sequential improvement was our network optimization efforts, but we also saw a benefit from our other revenue initiatives, especially managed business investments. Looking to second quarter, we expect our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue performance. In fact, we expect an all-time quarterly record for operating revenue. Second quarter 2024 RASM, after being calibrated for recent booking trends, is now expected to decrease in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year comparison includes a little over 1 point of headwind for holiday timing, both from outbound Easter shifting to the first quarter and for more outbound for the July travel shifting to third quarter. On a nominal sequential basis, this also implies another quarter of better than seasonally normal RASM improvement. Looking beyond second quarter, network planning teams are still reworking schedules in the back half of the year to accommodate Boeing delivery delays. After adjusting expectations for both current booking trends and for Boeing delivery delays, we are forecasting 2024 operating revenue growth to approach high single digits on a year-over-year basis. This expected revenue growth implies healthy RASM growth in the back half of the year, driven by revenue initiatives as well as a reduction in year-over-year trips. While our development market maturation efforts are off track, which I'll discuss in a moment, our other revenue initiatives are expected to continue to drive value over the balance of the year. In fact, network optimization benefits contributed roughly $100 million in incremental revenue in March alone, primarily from reductions to shoulder flying, early morning and late evening flights and short haul flying. For full year, the incremental year-over-year pretax profits from our strategic initiatives is now estimated to be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. After being updated for first quarter actual performance, development market adjustments and capacity changes in the back half of the year. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 continue to be revenue related. So while we are encouraged to see strong demand for our brand and solid sequential improvement, it is short of our goals. And as Bob and Tammy shared, it's simply not enough given the escalation of market-driven inflationary cost pressures. Therefore, we are taking actions to generate both immediate and longer-term revenue enhancements. We have stood up cross-functional teams to focus on things like accelerating the maturation of development markets further boost the value being delivered by our relatively new revenue management system and roll out new products and highlight our superior value proposition with our new brand campaign. We also have a larger team that is finalizing a more significant set of strategic initiatives, and they're tasked with delivering transformational streams of revenue productivity. Of course, we'll have more to share on this topic at Investor Day. As we build our plans, we will focus on leveraging our strengths, including those of our network, which, while it has optimization opportunities, remains incredibly relevant and well positioned based on size and population migration trends. We continue to hold the top position in 22 of the largest 50 domestic markets, and we are by far the market leader in that regard. Also, we're well positioned for the future as population and GDP growth trends are forecast to be strongest in the Southern and Mountain West regions of the country, regions where we have significant leadership. We'll also lean into the customer experience we deliver. Year-to-date, our Trip Net Promoter Score is up over 5 points year-over-year. And finally, we continue to enhance our award-winning Rapid Rewards program. Just this week, we began rolling out the ability to book and pay with part cash and part Rapid Rewards points, which I expect to be very popular with our customers. So in closing, we have a large and relevant network, a strong demand environment and a loyal and highly engaged customer base. We also have the best people whom I want to sincerely thank. And we are committed to being aggressive and innovative as we adapt, adjust and evolve to meet the preferences of our customers and to unlock the revenue productivity required to meet our financial imperatives. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by thanking our incredible Southwest employees for continuing to deliver a strong operational performance. We produced a solid first quarter completion factor of 98.5%, our highest first quarter performance over the past 5 years. We delivered year-over-year improvement in early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled bag rate, and again saw a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score, as Ryan mentioned. Our on-time performance declined slightly year-over-year, largely due to weather challenges and delays driven by ATC programs. However, I'm pleased to report that we improved year-over-year on-time performance for the month of March. I'm proud of the hard work and investments made to bolster our winter preparedness and modernize our operations, and I'm encouraged to see these efforts pay off in our operational performance. Picking up where Bob and Tammy left off, I want to stress that we remain focused on wringing out operational inefficiencies, increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. Our Southwest Turn initiative, which Bob shared, is tracking ahead of schedule and is a critical component of these efforts. One of the key elements include eliminating the need for printing on every flight, reducing the number of employee trips up and down the jet bridge, and recovering faster during the regular operations. We reached an important milestone in this multiyear effort just last week, with the launch of electronic flight folders, which modernized several of our flight planning processes by digitizing documents used by our pilots, dispatchers and ops agents. We also continue to make progress on modernizing the airport experience, and that initiative is also coming together faster than originally planned. Our efforts for improving the lobby customer experience are on track to provide improvement to staffing standards ahead of the original schedule. We are working on updated schedules and look forward to sharing those with you as well. I'd also like to highlight a new application called SkyPath we recently implemented and planned for our pilots and dispatchers to provide better awareness of turbulence along a flight path. This industry-leading system uses iPad sensors and GPS data from pilot's electronic flight bags to detect turbulence in real time, aggregating and sharing data from across -- from users across several airlines in North America. Our teams worked cross-functionally to accelerate the launch of this app for the spring season when we intend to see more turbulence across the network. And it's another tool we can use to support employees with additional information for decision-making, improve the onboard experience for customers and reduce operational risk. We look forward to sharing more on these and an expansive multiyear initiative-based efforts at Investor Day in September. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating all of our employees who reached agreements on new contracts over the past year or a little bit more than a year plus. Each contract requires a significant amount of work. And as always, we remain committed to rewarding our deserving employees. With that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. Julia Landrum : Great. Thanks, Andrew. That completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. To allow for as many calls as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, if needed. We will now take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : I guess, Tammy, I just want to -- on the bonuses to the employees incurred in the March quarter, just can you remind us that number again? I thought you -- I heard it. And then is it just we're going to see another piece in the second quarter with the approval of the flight attendant contract, by the way, congratulations, but another piece in the second? And then is that it for the year? If you can just remind me of those numbers. Tammy Romo : Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. First of all, we are thrilled to have an agreement with our wonderful flight attendants. And at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $625 million accrued for labor agreements that we expect to pay out for the remainder of this year. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great. And then just my second question, Ryan, I recently, I've seen you give some presentations and talk about red eyes and red eye flying coming to Southwest Airlines. And I think you said it's about a 2-year time frame. I'm just curious, what are the gating issues? What are the things that need to get done to be able to actually implement them? Because it does seem like a pretty long time, but I do realize it is something new for Southwest. Ryan Green : Yes. Mike, the -- we can move technology time lines around by reprioritizing things here and there. And so some of the gating -- there are crew scheduling changes that need to be made on a -- from a red eye standpoint. There are some changes that need to be made with some of our operational systems. And we can choose how fast or how fast to do those things and what elements go before or after them. So the 2-year was a rough estimate. We can go faster than that if we choose to do so. But it's just kind of a myriad of technology-related items. Andrew Watterson : Yes, this is Andrew. I'll add on. Some of the kind of bigger issues that slowed us down was with our crew contracts, our reserve periods. We had 2 reserve periods, for the pilots, in particular, and didn't allow for good coverage of red eyes. And so with a new contract, we'll eventually go to 3 reserve periods and allow us to better have reserve pilots on standby should there be a problem. So we didn't want to have those -- on a larger scale, those flights unexposed -- or exposed, rather, to no reserve. So the new contracts allow us the flexibility to have extra reserve periods, and that makes us much more comfortable proceeding. Robert Jordan : And Mike, this is Bob. You didn't ask this, but on the why, maybe not just the. Timing. But obviously, we've known for a long time, our customers want red eye flying. It's a little bit limited in scope, but there are red eye flights that are very desirable for our customers. And so we wanted to do this. It also allows us to add capacity, just like this turn work where you can add the capacity, and there's no CapEx related. You are just using the aircraft at higher utilization. So that's something we want to do, obviously. And then in a period here where we are overstaffed because we were shooting for a higher fleet number. Any incremental flying like that, that makes sense. Obviously, it alleviates at least a piece of that overstaffing with our pilots. So that's one to give a background on the why in addition to the long. Operator : The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : So Bob or Ryan, I think last quarter, we were talking about premium on the call. And you guys had made the comment that this is something that's cyclical, it comes up, it goes down. People put too much -- too many premium products in the cabin, and then they have to take them away in the down cycle. Is the work that you're doing now in terms of looking at the product a sign that this shift could be something more permanent? Can you guys just help us understand how your view of the market may be changing a little bit that's precipitating this sort of more strategic review? Robert Jordan : You bet, and thanks for the question. I think maybe I'd just start a little wider, which is we are always studying what our customer preferences are and if they're changing. That's now, over time -- and we're committed to meeting them. It's over time, we've added things like WiFi, and now we're adding seat power. We've added larger overhead bins, and so we're committed to meeting our customers' preferences. And just to be transparent, we've been seriously studying this question around onboard seating in our cabin for a while. And to get at what you just said, which is an understanding of what customer expectations are today, I'm proud of our product today and our customers love it. But it was designed at a time when load factors were lower. And higher load factors do change the way preferences work, the operation works and also our customer. The customer expectations change over time. So there's no decision. There's nothing to report, other than we are seriously looking at this. But early indications, both for our customers and for Southwest, look pretty darn interesting. So I'll just leave it there and more to follow. David Vernon : I appreciate that. And maybe just as a follow-up on the same topic. Is this -- if you were to go down this path, obviously, there's going to be cost of the cabin. But technologically, from a passenger service system and all that kind of stuff, like how complicated might that be to kind of think about doing things like seat assignments or segregating the cabin in some harder way? Is that a big technological challenge? Or is that something you guys already have the capability to do but just aren't doing? Robert Jordan : Well, we just don't -- I don't want to get into details because a lot of those we don't have. Again, we're looking at customer preference. Obviously, the -- how would you do it technically, how long would it, what impact, if any, would it have on the operation? Obviously, what's the financial impact? All of those things beyond the customer preference go in to how you make your decision. So again, I'll just say we're looking at this very seriously and more to come. And we look forward to sharing where we are at our Investor Day on September 26. Andrew Watterson : And I'd add, Bob, our PSS is the industry standard Amadeus tool, which obviously works in those environments. So the underlying system is not prohibited from doing that. Robert Jordan : That's right. Operator : The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just geographically, can you speak to how much differentiation you're seeing in unit revenue trends? You have a pretty broad-based domestic network. Could you just comment on like relative strength versus relative weakness geographically across the country? Ryan Green : Duane, I think there is definitely regional performance. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the West Coast did well. Particularly intra-Cal RASM and margins are up double digits year-over-year. Phoenix is doing really well. Vegas is doing really well. Of course, Vegas had some assistance there with the Super Bowl being there in February in the first quarter. But all those markets performing very, very well. The Northeast performed well. In Florida, there's been a lot of talk about Florida. Florida, we have above system average RASM. In Florida, it's come under pressure with some of the capacity growth there, but still, RASM is above system averages in Florida. So there's strength across the network. Of course, we've got some weaknesses in the development markets, which we've talked about. And we've got plans underway to address with the station closures that we've talked about. And then we've restructured some of those development markets and some of the schedules that we've had to republish here as a result of the Boeing delivery delays. But yes, there's -- as always, with the network, the -- it's a portfolio, and you've got markets that performed better than others. We're focused on making some improvements in those development markets. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Appreciate the thoughts. And then just on your capacity exit rate, why was it down low singles, low to mid-singles by the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about early 2025? And are we still in a dynamic, where seats are down more than ASMs. In other words, I think that was by several points, maybe 5 points or so that seats were trailing ASMs. Is that still the dynamic in the fourth quarter? Robert Jordan : Yes, Duane, thank you. And again, I'll just remind you that we're -- this is all very fluid as we work with Boeing on their delivery estimates. And obviously, '25 is more fluid than '24. And also, we are choosing how work -- so as we get some indication from Boeing, we're choosing how we're going to plan, which may be different because we don't want to have to go through this replanning the schedules over and over and over because it's very, very disruptive. So it's early to give you a signal on '25. But that said, I just would point out again that any capacity is going to come through either gauge or initiative-based additions, again, like the turn time work or red-eye flying. And so, again, it's too early, but I think you're thinking directionally correctly. I'll just stop there. And Tammy, unless you want to add something? Tammy Romo : No. The only thing I just might reiterate is we'll look to align our capacity growth for 2025 with demand. So we've got a little bit of time here. And obviously, one thing I'd point out is we do have fleet flexibility by design. So we'll continue to evaluate that. And then just at a higher level, again, we do plan to grow below macroeconomic growth trends until we get our financial going in the right direction to achieve our goals. Robert Jordan : And maybe the other thing to add, too, just to disconnect from Boeing, is the work on the network that work to moderate -- significantly moderate our capacity isn't just Boeing. I mean, this is something we need to do. We need to manage ourselves, manage our appetite, continue to mature the network, continues, as Ryan said, to work on the part of the network that is underperforming and moderate our capacity until we are hitting our financial targets. Obviously, moderating your capacity manages down CapEx. Managing down CapEx is critical to free cash flow. It all helps us achieve our ROIC targets. So I don't want to lay this at the feet. The capacity discipline and the network adjustments are Boeing. We are doing those things because we need to do those things to restore our financial -- our progress against our financial targets, and we will absolutely continue on that path until we get there. Andrew Watterson : And I think you take the sources of growth that Bob talked about and the network restructure, that does imply that our central tenancy is for seats to trail ASMs and for trips to trail seats. That's a natural consequence of those actions. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Yes. So Tammy, how should we be thinking about operating cash flow for the rest of the year? I mean we've got the retro component in there with the flight attendants. But presumably, a weaker demand outlook suggests some pressure on the air traffic liability. And then related, I guess, somewhat to that, the dividend consumes, what, $450 million a year, $450 million of cash. Any idea how the Board is thinking about that in light of some of the challenges that you articulated today? Tammy Romo : Yes. Jamie, we're focused, as Bob said, on generating free cash flow. Ultimately, we're working to restore our financial returns. So this year, we're very focused on what we can control. And we are working on lowering our CapEx. That's already come down quite a bit, as we've already shared. And just in terms of the liquidity targets that we have established with our Board, we do have a minimum cash target of $6 billion, which, of course, is on top of our revolver. So we're really working to manage, obviously, our operating cash flows and very focused on that, as we've taken you through in our remarks, and also working to balance that with our capital spending. So we are happy that we have our dividends reinstated. So no plans, at least, at this point, with the Board. But obviously, we'll continue to have those discussions as we move throughout the year. And again, Jamie, too, we -- our goal, as ever, is to maintain our investment-grade balance sheet and work towards our long-term leverage goal, which is in the low to mid-30% range. Obviously, we're sitting higher than that now, but we have our eye on that goal as well. Jamie Baker : Okay. And then Bob, so question, when you report earnings, does management then break up and host townhalls throughout the company. The reason I ask is that some airlines, some companies do that. I honestly don't know of Southwest. But I have to wonder, I mean, is the tone with the front line as somber as it is on this call? I mean, I guess it's hard to answer. But if I was in Baltimore right now, chatting up employees, do they get what's going on right now and just how grim this guide is? And the reason I ask is that clients are asking me if today's messaging is just reserved for Wall Street or if this is truly an all-hands-on-deck call for change, much like what Richard Anderson delivered at Delta in 2012, which, in fairness, did represent a real turn for that franchise. Any thoughts? Robert Jordan : Yes. Jamie, there's a lot in your question. So let me just start with we -- just to balance things out. Our financial returns are nowhere close to what we need and what we want them to be, period. And we will be relentless until we achieve those. The company -- so that is absolute. The company is not grim. In other words, we have significant demand for our product. We have awesome employees. We have real improvement in our operational performance and reliability. We had the best completion factor in 5 years. We have some of our highest NPS scores ever, on and on and on. So the company has a pile of just absolute attributes that our customers love. So I would sort of separate the grim in terms of our financial returns, which I agree, and the company is grim. Now your second -- your question is, is that -- does everybody know that? And are we aligned? Absolutely. We had a special all-senior leader meeting Tuesday, as an example, before this, to walk through exactly what we need to be doing, how to be thinking, what to be doing around the plan, how to be executing. I have multiple times-per-year meeting with every leader at this company, from supervisors on up, that's 4,000 people, where I can talk directly to them about what we need to be doing. The messaging may be slightly different. In other words, the messaging for them may be how they need to think about costs, how they need to be thinking about winning and capturing and retaining customers. But absolutely, there is a line of top to bottom and focus. We have a solid plan with solid actions that we are all committed to, and it's comprehensive. And it all drives towards restoring our financial returns and hitting our ROIC targets. We are committed to continued network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets. We're committed to adjusting our capacity and managing down CapEx, as we just talked about. We're created -- we're committed to creating capacity through initiatives, like the turn reduction and the red-eye flying because that creates capacity without spending a dollar on aircraft.. We're committed to enhancing our revenue performance and our demand through tuning our RM system and the major marketing efforts that Ryan has underway to drive demand and loyalty. We're committed to offsetting our cost pressures through efficiency efforts and programs to reduce head count. We're going to be down 2,000 this year, down further next year, and we're down close to another 800 right now on top of that through these voluntary time-off programs. And we're committed to a set of new strategic initiatives. I've hinted it, boarding and seating and the cabin, and we're going to share those with you at Investor Day. Operator : There's time for one more question. It will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi Syth : If I might, just on the business revenue, that was a good performance here. I was curious what your 2Q outlook is reflecting in terms of expectations and what you're seeing there. Ryan Green : Savi, yes, managed business was up very healthy in the first quarter, up 25% and reached a significant milestone in getting back to flat to 2019 levels. So we were really pleased with that. That was driven by a double-digit increase in unique travelers traveling under a contract in the managed business space. So that just means we're penetrating deeper into accounts. We're growing the number of companies under accounts, and we continue to pick up market share there.  As we look forward, we expect the performance to continue and to accelerate the sequential performance in the second quarter to be better than the first. And it's kind of -- it's across the board. Our top 15 industries, 11 of those had double-digit growth year-over-year. So the performance is widespread, and we expect it to continue and to help our revenue performance as we go forward. Savanthi Syth : That's helpful. If I might just ask just a question related to CapEx and just given your current outlook. Thoughts, Tammy, on kind of free cash flow generation here and kind of looking forward a little bit, what's realistic? Tammy Romo : Yes, Savi. We're -- as we said, we're expecting CapEx this year at $2.5 billion, and that includes about $1 billion in aircraft spend. We are working through our plans for next year. So it's a bit early to give you guidance for next year. Obviously, we're working through that actively now. So we'll update you on our CapEx spending plans as part of our comprehensive update in September at our Investor Day. Savanthi Syth : Is the view that kind of -- is free cash flow generation important and possible? Or how are you thinking about kind of translating that CapEx into what... Tammy Romo : We are absolutely working with the view to generate free cash flow. We -- so that will obviously be part of the equation as we pull together our plan for next year.  Okay. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin taking your questions, Gary, could you remind us and share instructions on how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Alexandra Skores with the Dallas Morning News. Alexandra Skores : Can you all hear me? Okay, perfect. I'm wondering if we could hone in on the 4 airports that were announced today that would be cut, and same with Atlanta and Chicago that are being reduced in flights. Could you talk a little bit about the decision to -- for those specific airports to be chosen? Robert Jordan : Well, it's never -- I'll just start with this. It's never an easy decision to close a station or to materially reduce flights in the station. We love our airports. We serve our communities, and so it's always difficult. But again, I'll just go back to we have portions of the network -- a higher-than-normal portion of the network that's just not performing to the level that we need, and for a variety of reasons. And so we need to hit our financial returns, and we will. And so you have to make the tough decision to continue working down the level of markets that aren't performing. So it was really that. It's just as we look at -- as we look at our network, it really relates to the areas that are -- just don't have a path to the level of financial performance that we need. That's really the basis for the decision. I don't know, Ryan, if you want to add anything else or Andrew? Ryan Green : No, you covered it, I think. Alexandra Skores : And my second question, what kind of communications have been given to the employees at those airports? Robert Jordan : We have a very -- as you would expect, we take care of our employees, we take care of our partners, and we have a very rich communication plan that -- to go in the right order, to make sure we communicate with folks, it's done with compassion. Our employees will be offered jobs in other cities. And so they have a lot of options. But no, we handled all this, as you would expect, Southwest Airlines to handle it. Andrew Watterson : Yes. We staged senior leaders there last night. So at very early morning hours, our people -- our leaders were there to explain the whys to the employees as well as to the airports, and then also to go through with them the different options they'll have for moving. It's a seniority-based system with our unions, and so how that will all work for them. And so they've gone through that. There's obviously a range of emotions. People chose to relocate there, and so they will have some natural disappointment in the short term. But these people have long careers in Southwest Airlines, and our ground employees tend to move around a decent amount anyway. So we expect most of them to take advantage, if not all, of the opportunities to relocate to other stations. Alexandra Skores : Got it. So that's every employee that's impacted is going to be offering some sort of job? Andrew Watterson : Yes. They will remain employed, so they choose to do so. Operator : The next question is from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I appreciate it. I wanted to see if you could talk about the extent of the reductions in O'Hare and Atlanta. Andrew Watterson : There are about -- we took about half of O'Hare down from about 30 something flights to about 15, 18 flights during the seasoned day of the week. So it's about a 50% reduction in Atlanta. I can't remember off the top of my head, Ryan. It was 30%, I want to say, off the top of my head. Ryan Green : Yes, about 1/3. Andrew Watterson : Yes, it's unfortunate. We had been restoring Atlanta over the course of post pandemic. We could never quite get back to the level of performance we needed there at the scale we needed. And so it's been reduced back down to a level just shortly coming out of the pandemic. And so it's still substantial activity there, it's just not as big as it was before. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. And if you could also address the impact of the new refund policies that were announced by the DOT yesterday, whether that's going to be a financial problem for Southwest? Or and if you expect to have any trouble complying with those new rules? Ryan Green : Mary, it's Ryan. Well, it's new. As you know, it was just issued yesterday. So we're digesting exactly what all of that means. But based on our read, so far, I don't expect that it's going to be a significant impact. Of course, we already have the most customer-friendly policies in the industry. So we're best positioned to comply with any of these new regulations out of the gate. And today, if there's a long delay or a cancellation, customers can receive a refund from Southwest. So there's no real change there from our standpoint. And then, of course, unique in the industry, flight credits don't expire with Southwest, if you have to cancel your flight for any reason. But in general, we're proud to be unique among airlines in having these customer-friendly policies. No bag fees, no change fees, flight credits don't expire, we don't nickel and dime customers. But the -- those are our choices without government intervention. And it shows the marketplace works as consumers want different choices in who they fly. So again, I'd just point to the fact that we have the most customer-friendly policies in the industry, and I just don't see a tremendous amount of impact to Southwest from this. Operator : Your Next question is from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I know that the overall demand environment remains very strong. But I am curious if you're seeing any indications of bookaway or traveler nervousness about Boeing or air safety more broadly? Robert Jordan : We -- I'll just give you a little overview and then, obviously, Ryan can jump in. We -- this is something that we look at. So we study, we survey to understand our customers' views, and whether anything that's going on impacts their view of Southwest or the industry generally. That's not perfect, but we don't see any -- we don't see an indication that this is having an impact on bookings or demand. It's not perfect. I think logic would tell you there could be something there. But certainly, we don't see anything material. Ryan? Ryan Green : Yes. The only other thing that I would add is that we certainly are serving on the front end to see how top of mind it is for consumers when they're making a booking. And then we also look at cancellations and ask customers once they cancel a flight, what their reasons for cancellations were. And safety concerns or a Boeing aircraft as a result of that on the cancellation side is 1% of our cancellations. So it's a very, very small number, not material, I don't think, to the overall picture. Alison Sider : Interesting. And the 4 cities, the 4 markets that you're exiting, are those cities that you think would have been more successful if you had the MAX-7 in your fleet or had it coming soon? Ryan Green : I think the markets themselves were just performing at a level that we needed to make the tough choice to remove them from the network. And I don't think that a smaller aircraft would have had a material difference on those markets. Operator : The next question is from Dawn Gilbertson with Wall Street Journal. Dawn Gilbertson : Bob, about 6 months ago, you were asked, as you always are, about the premium question, the open seating versus assigned seating. And you mentioned, as you always do, that you always said it's customer preferences and if something changes, you'll adapt, as you said today. But here's what you said then. You said there's nothing underway. There's no story here, nothing underway. So can you help us understand what has dramatically changed in the past 6 months on that particular front? And also related to that, is there any financially significant change to boarding or seating you can do without assigning seats? Robert Jordan : You bet, Dawn. Thank you. I think the -- it's what you say that the difference is we -- this is something that we look at on sort of on the surface pretty regularly. But in terms of a very deep dive of understanding customer preference and what we might do, that's something we do less frequently. So the answer was different 6 months ago because the work has really accelerated. It's work that we've done since then. And there's a lot of discussion out there about just cabin and premium and all kinds of things. So it may be, just generally, a customer preference. So it makes sense in terms of timing to study that. Again, we always want to understand what our customers want and desire. And so again, we're -- I'll just again to tell you that we are very seriously studying this, and we're pretty deep in that study. And again, nothing to reveal today, except that there are some interesting indications in terms of what this could mean to us and what it can mean to our customers. Again, nothing to reveal. On your question about, are there other things you could do in boarding in particular? Our boarding process, we changed -- actually, it's over -- I think it's over a decade ago at this point, is very well received by our customers because it's very organized and the way you line up. We have worked hard to monetize that and give our customers choice. You -- we give you choice around how you think about your boarding position, and that's more important to some customers than others. But we've got that. We've got Business Select. We have an upgraded boarding at the gate product. I will admit, it is hard for me. Ryan might tag in here. It's hard for me to think of how we can, really, from a financial perspective or a customer desire perspective, really push that even further. I think the products that we've added really attack what our customers want. So being just blunt. It is hard to think about how to implement more products related to boarding. Ryan Green : Yes, I would agree with that on the incremental products. But what we are doing and what we can continue to do is to get better at how we price those products and drive incremental yield from those ancillary products. In total, our ancillary revenue in the first quarter was up 18% year-over-year. So well in excess of our O&D passenger growth. So we continue to push on optimizing for revenue there on our ancillary products, particularly the boarding products. But in terms of adding incremental products, it's tough to imagine how that would fit into the current boarding process. Dawn Gilbertson : If I can follow up then. My question is about -- you're talking about transformational changes here, and you're hinting at boarding and seating. So can you do -- what kinds of things can you do, if anything, that doesn't involve assigning seats? Because to me, that would be transformational for Southwest. Like what -- can you give us -- I know you're not going to go into any detail until Investor Day, but what specifically is going to be different? Because just I think the price of upgraded boarding and early bird is obviously not going to meet your financial goals, as you just said. Robert Jordan : No, you're -- you -- I think you're exactly right, which is that's why you want to look at all of these things. And we're just not ready to tell you exactly what we're studying, and we're not ready to tell you then how that could, if we decide to go forward, turn into a different product design and a plan. But yes, just conceptually, that where you're going is the reason we're looking at this is we know, over time, customer preference has changed. They have my whole 36 years here at Southwest Airlines. And we have changed a lot. We've changed our boarding. We've changed our -- the product that we offer on board. We added loyalty programs and modified those. So we are constantly changing to meet customer demand. So it's critical to understand 3 things. Number one, what do your customers want? And that's really what we're studying right now. Two, what does that do to the way you operate the airline? Because we are obviously a bedrock of the company, is operating very efficiently, having a quick operation, great turn times, being efficient. And so making sure that whatever you might want to do, it's fit in with that. And then obviously, the third piece is, is it financially beneficial? Back to hitting our financial goals, a piece of this is, as Ryan mentioned, continuing to drive progress against our financial aspirations and goals and hitting our ROIC and margin goals. So all those 3 things have to work together. And we're just not ready to share details today, but we will be, as we move across the summer and into our Investor Day in September. Operator : The next question is from David Koenig with the Associated Press. David Koenig : Well, I was going to ask about the transformational options for seating, but I think you've probably said all you're going to say on that, Bob.  If I -- if you could go into a little bit of explanation on the 2,000 head count reduction. First of all, I'd like to know how many jobs you think will be eliminated by the closure of those 4 airports? And any drawdown at O'Hare and Atlanta and elsewhere? And then secondly, are you saying that you can get to 2,000 fewer jobs this year just through attrition and leaves? Can you rule out furloughs? Robert Jordan : David, thank you. And yes, no, thanks for allowing me the ability to clarify that. We have line of sight on the 2,000 that does not include furloughs. or anything like that, that we don't want to put on the table. And then it also does not include a headcount that are effectively sort of out of the workforce in terms of not being paid because they are on voluntary unpaid leave. So it doesn't even count that. So this is really through attrition, in some cases, reassigning folks to other work that does need to be done. But it's also coming through pretty sophisticated initiatives. We have initiatives underway to use Gen AI to automate the way we handle -- cut some of our customer support functions, generate responses, decide what to do with the customer request. We have other significant continuous improvement in automation going on in other parts of the company, and we plan to accelerate that. So not furloughs. It is primarily through planned attrition that we know we have a line of sight to. So and again, the line of sight to the 2,000, the folks that are effectively out of the workforce because we're not -- they're not being paid in their own voluntary time-off programs. That's on top of the 2,000. David Koenig : Okay. And how many of the 2,000 do you think will be pilots? Andrew Watterson : Yes. I don't think we give a breakdown by work group, David. There'll be some that will be back office, i.e., people that work at headquarters, some that will be at frontline. We have -- there's natural attrition that goes along throughout the company, whether one reaches retirement age or one decides to go find a different job. You have that natural. We have a good history on that, so we can model out what that's going to look like and which ones we need to backfill, which ones do not need to backfill, and that's how we get to these projections. It's not any kind of reduction in force or eliminating people currently employed. It's more when positions become available, not backfilling them. Operator : The next question is from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Just knowing what you know now from these customer surveys about potential seating changes, are you thinking that it could be like a big front seat or bigger front seat-type product? Or do you think that, at some point, there will be a curtain on a Southwest Airlines plane? And secondly, are you ruling out baggage fees entirely? Is that still -- or is that something that's on the table for you as you're looking at revenue initiatives? And then on the 1% of bookings that were canceled because of concerns about air safety, how many people is 1%? And how does that compare with -- after the MAX crashes and the plane came back? Ryan Green : Leslie, I'll try and take all of those. The first one on what we're learning from customer research, I think just stay tuned there. We'll have more to share on what we're learning and how that factors into what we may do different, if anything, at all. I will say though, the Southwest Airlines is -- we will stay true no matter what we do to the brand and who we are and how we approach customers. And I think things like curtains and things like that are a bit far field from who Southwest Airlines is. On your bag fee question, no, we are not considering bag fees. The reason we're not considering bag fees is because people choose Southwest Airlines because we don't have bag fees. If you go look the most recent J.D. Power survey, which, obviously, is an independent syndicated piece of research that's well respected in the industry. Over 60% of customers say that they choose Southwest Airlines as one of their top reasons because of bag fees. You -- companies love to have differentiation in their product that drives customer preference and drives customer choice.   Our next closest competitor on that measure is Alaska at $19. So we get 3x the preference in terms of bag fees relative to our competition. So that's why bag fees are not on the table for consideration. On the 1% of cancellations, it's a very small number. We don't -- our overall cancellation rate is a very small number, so 1% of that is a very, very small number. So it's not material. Andrew Watterson : Yes. And I'll just quickly emphasize on that, Leslie. It's not 1% of our bookings that got canceled because of all of those people who canceled. And so yesterday, 0.4% of people canceled and 1% of that, 0.4%, said it was safety concerns. So it's a very small number of an extraordinarily small number that did that, which is why Ryan would say it's immaterial or even inconsequential. Leslie Josephs : And how does that compare with when the MAX came back in 2020 after the crashes? Andrew Watterson : That was also quite small. I mean we also track people who look at what the aircraft type is on the website, and those really didn't see any movement of consequence in there. And so it seems like this is not something that customers investigate any great deal. With the very early days of the MAX grounding, there were some interests heightened to that. When the MAX came back, it was -- we prepared as if it would be a thing of interest, and it was not a thing of interest. And currently, customers are acting as if it's not a thing of interest as well. So it's I think that even though Boeing is having individual controllers as a company, customers are trusting at least Southwest Airlines and that we will operate our aircraft safely. Operator : The next question is from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Rajesh Singh : Bob, all the additional voluntary time-off programs that you're considering, does that include the pilots as well? Andrew Watterson : Rajesh, this is Andrew. And so what we're doing right now that we've spoken of is the voluntary time-off has roughly been with our ground operations, flight attendants and some of our call center people. They've taken advantage of that for flexibility in their programs. We do not have anything with our pilots at the moment. A provision of our contract requires us to consult with them, and we will certainly do that before we do anything with regards to our pilots. Rajesh Singh : Bob, you said that you were encouraged by Boeing's approach. Can you please share some specific examples and color that make you feel encouraged about their approach? Andrew Watterson : Andrew, again, I'll take that because I was up there with Bob on our visit. And so really, we're impressed by how Boeing is putting kind of quality ahead of short-term profit, so to speak. So an example is, they have many portions in their factory. There's like 10 stations they go through the construction. They don't allow anything to progress past stage 3 that has troubled work. And so that creates gaps in their factory, which then leads to obviously a plane that's not sold and delivered that month. So the fact they're taking this very strong approach to bring quality out in the early stages of the production process from their suppliers is a much different approach. And frankly, is one that puts safety ahead of profitability in the short term. But it's obviously they're a long-term interest. So we were very impressed by that kind of not just change of words, but by change of actions. Robert Jordan : Yes. You want to see the tone at the top be appropriate, which is an understanding that -- again, I can't speak for Boeing. I'm just thinking about how we view this. But a tone that recognizes that this is a big issue, and it's bigger than a quality escape. And to some extent, it is a cultural issue. And so they need to attack it very broadly. And that is the way that they -- our view when we visit with them, that is the way that they appear to be tackling that, as Andrew said, it appears to be showing up in their actions. Now at the end of the day, they have to deliver and -- but no, no, we are encouraged by what we're seeing. Rajesh Singh : And have you increased your inspectors at the Boeing sites following the last several incident? Andrew Watterson : Thank you for the question. In 2022, we increased from having just a representative, which other airlines have, to having a team of AMP-certified mechanics on process, on site to inspect our aircraft as they go through the production process. I believe there's north of 85 inspection points that they look at between entering the factory and exiting the factory. And so that is the way we assure day-to-day that our quality of aircraft is maintained. We additionally have the engagement at the executive level that Bob talked about where we also see good results. So overall, our heightened attention to Boeing and the quality of the aircraft they manufacture has been going on for a while, and we think it's bearing fruit. Operator : The next question is from David Slotnick with TPG. David Slotnick : And going back to the transformation, you said that you're looking at changing customer preferences. And I'm sort of just wondering what perspective you're taking on that? Like are you looking at this as something where, because of those preferences, customers are choosing to book other airlines over Southwest? Or are you looking at this as maybe a place where Southwest is missing an opportunity to earn revenue on premiums or upsell like your rivals are from existing passengers? Robert Jordan : Ryan can give you much more detail, but I think you want to know all those things. You want to know why do customers book Southwest? What do they expect of Southwest? You want to know why do they book others and not Southwest Airlines. You want to know if they have preferences for other things within our product that we don't offer today, how do you think about pricing, those kinds of things and how it affects their desire to book Southwest Airlines. But now you want to need to know all those things. And again, additionally, in addition to the customer preference, you need to know what does it do for the operation and how we how -- how quickly especially we turn our aircraft and we're studying that as well. Ryan? Ryan Green : I think you hit it all. Clearly, with any sort of transformational change, you're going to have a very robust, highly scientific, very sophisticated statistical models and research methodologies to test all of those things that Bob walked through. that's what anybody would expect of a company like Southwest, and that's the rigor at which we are approaching studying this issue. David Slotnick : And I mean, back to the question before, just considering the share of their revenue that your rivals are earning from upsells and from premium. Do you think you can really rule out something like a curtain in the cabin? Ryan Green : Look, we're going to study customer -- like we've said, we're going to study customer preferences, but there's strong demand today for Southwest Airlines and the brand that we put and the product that we put in the marketplace today, it has worked for us for over 50 years, and customers understand well who we are and what we bring to the marketplace. We're not going to try to be somebody that we're not. And so we'll study it all, but we're -- at the end of the day, we're going to remain true to who Southwest Airlines is. Andrew Watterson : I think you also have to look at the revenue per square foot you get in the cabin, and so it can be seem like you may want to have a fancy product. But if it doesn't generate revenue off of that square foot you have in the cabin, then it's necessarily not worth it. So we take a strong eye to the revenue that any of our products would generate as we evaluate this. Robert Jordan : And I think the -- I know we've said this probably 20 times on the call today, and I think the other short answer is we're not ready to go into detail. We have work to do here, obviously, to continue to finish up our work. And then if there are things we do want to change, understand how we would do it in the Southwest way. And so we will be back with detail when we're ready. And if there is something that we're going to change, we're aiming to do that at our Investor Day, which is planned in September. And we'll share, obviously, a lot more then. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session for media. So back over to Whitney now for some closing thoughts. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks to everyone who joined us today. If you guys have any further questions, our Communications Group is standing by. Their contact information, along with today's news release, are all available at swamedia.com. Operator : The conference has concluded. Thank you all for attending.

Our press release with second quarter 2024 results and a separate release announcing select strategic initiatives were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Julie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We have a lot to cover today, so let's jump right in. In my comments today, I will touch briefly on our results for the quarter and then provide detail on the plans we announced earlier this morning to implement meaningful changes to our business and better position Southwest Airlines to produce higher returns in a more competitive higher cost environment. As Julie mentioned, Andrew will provide details on our revenue performance, including the work underway to calibrate our revenue management system and processes, and Tammy will discuss our cost, CapEx and balance sheet. Starting with our overall results, they are not where we need them to be, and they are not reflective of what we are capable of delivering. We will cover where we fell short as well as our action plan in detail later on the call, but I'll hit on a few highlights first. Our frontline employees executed very well as we continue to improve in nearly every operating and customer metric. Once again, we ran a high-quality operation with a completion factor of 99.5% despite challenging weather. This was further evidenced by our performance following Hurricane Beryl earlier this month. We experienced an 8% cancel rate on July 8th as the store moved through the Houston area but had only a 0.3% cancel rate the following day as we recovered quickly with almost no operational hangover from the prior day. I am very proud of our team. And following the global technology outages, we were able to recover very quickly and experienced a near zero cancel rate. Investments made to advance core operations and modernize technology meant that we had redundancy in place for key systems that we're experiencing issues. Time and time again, the purposeful investments we've made to improve our resilience and ability to recover from disruptions are demonstrating their value and that investment will continue. Our exceptional customer service continues to improve as well and was recently recognized by J.D. Power, where we were awarded the leading Economy Class Customer Satisfaction distinction for the third consecutive year. Reliable operational performance and customer service are and always will be cornerstones of our business model. Moving on to revenue performance. Unit revenue for the quarter declined 3.8% year-over-year primarily as a result of domestic capacity outpacing demand. The decline was also a result of Southwest specific challenges as we fully mature our usage of a new O&D based revenue management system. Andrew will go into more detail later, but bottom line, we sold too many seats for the peak summer travel period too early in the booking curve. It's not unusual to have growing pains with these types of systems. We are working quickly to action opportunities to drive performance improvement. We're also adding additional leadership expertise and support, including our plan to hire a Chief Revenue Officer to focus on revenue management and pricing. We continue to have confidence that the new revenue management system will be a driver of long-term revenue improvement. The management team and I, with the support of our Board, are completely aligned on the imperative to produce results and ultimately deliver returns ahead of our cost of capital. Doing so requires an evaluation of all opportunities and a willingness to evolve some long-standing selfless policies while staying true to our values. With that in mind, I'll discuss some of the changes we are making to further evolve Southwest Airlines. These are part of an ongoing strategic transformation of the business, and we will share more details during our Investor Day, where we will outline a comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline. As I shared back in April, our teams have been hard at work evaluating fundamental changes to our seating, cabin and boarding procedures. It's clear that the open seating model that served us well for so many years is no longer optimal for today's customer. I want to stress that this decision was not made lightly. We have been very thorough and deliberate in how we approach the question, conducting multiple sophisticated research studies over many months that evaluated customer preference and looked at different types of cabin layouts and seating methods. Our research shows that 80% of our customers prefer an assigned seat, and 86% of our potential customers prefer an assigned seat. Further, when a customer defects from Southwest to one of our competitors, our open seating policy is cited as the number one reason why. The answer is clear, there is more demand for Southwest Airlines with an assigned seating model, and there is a significant ability to monetize the cabin more effectively with a premium seating option. By extension, these changes are expected to drive significant value for our shareholders. We feel confident that the solution we are implementing will retain the positive elements of the Southwest Airlines experience and enable us to evolve in a manner that's consistent with what today's air traveler is seeking. While specific cabin layouts are still being finalized, we expect roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom. We're also designing a boarding process that retains the organized com our customers enjoy today, but also complements an assigned seating model. We've been studying this in depth to preserve our operational efficiency and how quickly we turn an aircraft. We've conducted both live boarding tests to understand passenger movement in a real world environment and also more than 8 million digital simulations to test different boarding options. These digital boarding simulations include data from real flights with real passenger manifest to understand differences in boarding times stemming from passenger mix, things like families traveling together, customers who may need more time to board experienced versus inexperienced travelers and more. The data clearly indicates that any operational impacts are neutral or an enhancement to current performance. We're also approaching this change in a capital-efficient manner. New aircraft will be delivered with our improved RECARO seats beginning early next year. For existing aircraft where we must retrofit to a new configuration, we plan to use existing seats within our fleet to avoid a large capital expenditure. We're working quickly to realize the value of this new model as soon as possible. New seat configurations require FAA certification, which typically takes several months and only then can we begin the process of retrofitting the fleet. We, therefore, expect to make bookings available beginning next year. The aircraft downtime should be minimal to complete the cabin changes, but keep in mind that we have a fleet of roughly 800 aircraft to retrofit and that will take time. Changing from an open seating model an assigned seating model will be a complex and transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company and is one of several commercial initiatives currently underway to be detailed at our Investor Day. Given the significance of the changes I've asked our Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, to take on leadership of this initiative on a full-time basis. As EVP of Commercial Transformation, Ryan will lead this effort along with other commercial initiatives already underway. Ryan has led the work to this point and is steeped in knowledge regarding customer trends and previously and successfully led efforts to transform our Rapid Rewards loyalty program and the digital customer experience, and Ryan will report directly to me. Additionally, today, we are publishing schedule that incorporate red-eye flying, which will phase in rapidly by summer 2025 and combined with ongoing reductions in turn time through new technologies and procedures will enable us to fund nearly all new capacity the next three years through initiatives rather than additional aircraft CapEx. These initiatives are part of a comprehensive strategic transformation and reflect a commitment and my personal commitment to deliver an implementing plan aimed at driving shareholder value and achieving ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. We will provide more details around the timing and value of these initiatives and other tactical and strategic initiatives when we gather for Investor Day in late September, but we wanted to keep you up to speed on some of the decisions that we've made already and the deliberate plans we have in place to implement them. And before I close, I want to again recognize all the efforts from our incredible employees. Thank you for excellence and the dedication that you bring to work every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew to provide a full update on our revenue performance and outlook. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Bob. I'm very excited about the strategic initiatives we have coming. I am also very proud of our people for their continued focus on safety, running a quality operation with the lowest year-to-date cancellation rate in the industry, and our strong customer service performance trends. Moving to revenue performance. We have experienced challenges in managing demand across booking curves as we deployed efforts to address load factor underperformance. As a result, we experienced yields and ultimately, revenue dilution from selling too many seats too early in the booking curve. As you will likely recall, back in the spring of 2023, we transitioned to a new and modernized revenue management system. The system is fundamentally different from and superior to our prior system. The new system manages revenue on an origin of destination basis compared with our prior leg-based system. The decision to implement this new system followed an extensive review of our options, including a comprehensive 18-month long pilot to evaluate and test two new revenue management systems against our prior system. What we directly observed during the testing period was the system we selected, consistently produced superior results. The goal is to maximize the revenue performance of our flights, especially best flights. And the new system accomplishes just that by considering what customers are willing to pay at different phases of the booking curve, including taking note of the differentiation between business and leisure customers. However, adapting to a new system is not straightforward. Add to that, changing schedules from Boeing delivery shifts and what we got was a complicated rollout. Regardless, while we estimate about 2 points of year-over-year headwind to the third quarter from bookings already in place, we were taking decisive actions to recalibrate the system. The estimated impact is already built in to our 3Q RASM outlook of flat to down 2% on a year-over-year basis. The outside experts, that Bob mentioned, are supporting our employees and getting the most as the capabilities of this new system. The good news is that we have confidence in the superiority of new system as evidenced by the month-long AB testing that we conducted. As we gain expertise in optimizing system, we expect to see a noticeable tailwind to performance, likely starting in September of this year. Adopting a new revenue management system is a once-in-a-generation implementation, and we are committed to executing a successful turnaround in our revenue performance. In addition to the improvement we expect to see in our revenue management performance, our plan includes continued network optimization and capacity moderation moving to the back half of the year. Our summer, fall and recently published winter-based schedules all include actions to target supply demand across geographies and calendar periods as well as scheduled quality actions to facilitate demand capture. By the fourth quarter, we expect less capacity oversupply as well improvements in our revenue management. We are planning for our capacity to decline 4% year-over-year in fourth quarter, with seats and trips down roughly 8% and therefore, we expect RASM growth to be positive year-over-year by fourth quarter. We will deliberately and urgently pursue tactical opportunities to improve financial performance, including calibrating our revenue management process, continuing our work to optimize our network. Further, we also have a plan to capitalize on transformational opportunities to generate incremental revenue, some of which Bob shared with you. Before I close, I want to thank our people again for doing such an amazing job driving operational excellence and providing our legendary hospitality, I am so appreciative of their contributions. With that, I'll turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, I will provide an update on our cost performance before turning to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our second quarter CASM-X increased 6% year-over-year and we continue to expect CASM-X for full year 2024 to increase in the range of 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. The higher year-over-year CASM-X growth in the second half of this year is driven primarily by a continuation of market-driven labor cost pressure from our new contracts as well as from the moderation of year-over-year capacity growth. We are urgently and deliberately pursuing opportunities to mitigate cost pressures, including the drag from overstaffing related to previously reported Boeing delivery delays. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we have expanded our voluntary leave and time off programs to further reduce labor expenses and bring staffing levels in line with our current fleet. We have halted all the critical hiring, and we continue to expect to end this year with head count down roughly 2,000 from year-end 2023. And we continue to plan for headcount to be down again in 2025 as attrition levels exceed our controlled hiring levels. Our second quarter average fuel price of $2.76 per gallon was in line with our expectations. Our hedge portfolio continues to provide protection against spikes in prices and we are continuing to opportunistically add protection with no change to our target of a roughly 50% hedge position. Turning to our fleet. We prudently adjusted our 2024 delivery expectations prior to our April earnings report to mitigate Boeing delivery risk our internal planning functions. We, therefore, continue to plan for 20 -8 aircraft deliveries, 31 -700 retirements, and four -800 lease returns for the year. We remain committed to our fleet modernization benefit and our planned reduction in aircraft exceeds our planned delivery. We also remain committed to longer-term capacity discipline and ROIC production. We expect third quarter capacity to increase approximately 2% and fourth quarter capacity to decrease approximately 4%. Accordingly, our expectation for full year 2024 capacity continues to be up approximately 4% year-over-year. Looking beyond 2024, we remain committed to earning our right to grow and plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach long-term financial goal of returns on invested capital consistently in excess of our cost of capital. Our expected capital spending for 2024 is approximately $2.5 billion, which is in line with our prior guidance and well below our expectations of $3.5 billion to $4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are in ongoing discussions with Boeing regarding the financial impact of delivery delays and as with past compensation, we expect any financial damages to be realized as a reduction in the cost basis of certain aircraft. Our balance sheet is obviously a critical competitive strength with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We continue to be in a net cash position as we ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $10 billion versus $8 billion outstanding debt. We expect a modest $29 million in scheduled debt repayments for the full year, and currently, 2024 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2024 interest expense. Following the pandemic, we have maintained elevated liquidity levels primarily to fund fleet modernization efforts, labor contract ratification bonuses, debt service considerations and to provide insurance against unforeseen business risk. With much of the uncertainty largely behind us, we intend to start normalizing our liquidity levels back towards pre-COVID levels targeting minimum total liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our long-term financial goals remain unchanged; maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit ratings and ample liquidity, grow earnings, margins and capital returns. As Andrew said, we intend to pay off 2025 debt maturities at least partially in cash and specifically plan to repay or refinance the first tranche of the payroll support program loans as the associated interest rates start to ratchet higher for the industry beginning next year. We also remain committed to our legacy of healthy shareholder returns. We are proud of our history of returning capital to our shareholders. We returned more than $13.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010 and we returned $215 million to shareholders through dividends in the first half of this year. We paid another dividend just a couple of weeks ago during third quarter. We are actively reviewing our return of capital policies, and ultimately, our goal is to restore shareholder returns to historic levels. As I close, I want to reiterate that our financial performance is not reflective of what we can and must deliver. As shareholders, you expect us to lead the industry in financial performance and we will be satisfied with nothing less. There are areas we need to improve, which we are owning and addressing as a management team. Despite these distractions, our employees remain steadfast in their dedication to the mission of the company and to providing our storied and world-class hospitality to our valued customers. I am both proud and grateful for our employees. I am excited about the plans we have in place to secure a bright future for Southwest and to share more about our tactical and strategic initiatives, as well as our capital allocation plan at Investor Day in September. We remain fully committed to executing on a plan to restore returns on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital, as this remains our guiding financial principles. And with that, I will turn it back over to you, Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you, Tammy. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analysts' questions. We would like to get as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, if necessary. We will now take the first question. Operator : Let\u2019s begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Bob, we definitely appreciate the new product changes that you announced today, like extra leg room, red-eye flying. But I think you'd agree, these have been offered for decades at your competitors. So I guess can you give us insight into the timing of this? Why now? And why wasn't this with that maybe even just a few years ago when you did do like a cabin redesign? Bob Jordan : Yeah, Brandon. I think a lot of things changed. I mean you have changing demand patterns. We have customer preference that is always changing. It changed to some extent, also coming out of the pandemic. You can always debate when. At end of the day, it's the right thing to do right now, particularly as we over time have flown longer and flights are more full. I think that is a large driver of this. One of the things that's obvious is if you have a longer flight, customers have a preference to know where they are sitting, just like they have a preference to have seat back power. And I was, I'll admit, a bit surprised. We did extensive research here. Tens of thousands of customers of customers surveyed a lot work, conjoint analysis to understand products, what customers prefer what they're willing to pay for. And while I wasn't surprised that the preference ended up coming out for assigned seating, and more premium options in the cabin. I was surprised at the level of the preference, 80% in favor of assigned seating amongst our customers, 86% amongst those that fly other carriers. And then, of course, we reported, it was the number one reason that customers when they defect from Southwest Airlines that they leave us. So it's very clear that there's strong, strong demand. But you can always pick the time and the place. I'm 100% forward focused. In other words, we've done the work to ensure that this is the right change. The change is right to do now where you're not quite ready to share the time lines other than that we plan on selling the new seating in 2025, and we'll share all of that at our Investor Day in September, but it's clearly the right thing to do for our customers, for our employees and for our shareholders. Brandon Oglenski : Well, I think your investors appreciate the effort here to make changes. But I think some of the public criticism being levied on the company and the Board is that, it's been such an insular culture. These things couldn't even have been discussed years ago. I guess, what are you doing from that aspect? Are you looking to fill some of these executive positions externally? Bob Jordan : Yes. I think you could always -- hindsight is always a lot more perfect. And so you can always look back and criticize the timing of a decision. I'm just telling you that we're 100% focused on transformational change here at Southwest Airlines, driving forward and driving forward with pace. You heard us today announce not just the assigned seating and the cabin changes. You heard us announce red-eye flying, which is not something we are working on. It's something we have worked on, and it's in the schedules published today. We've been working aggressively on operational systems, which we could talk about. And that work on operational systems allowed us during the tech outage last week to have a, I believe, was a 99.8% completion factor on the day of the tech outage. And we had systems, critical systems to the operation affected. So we are fully focused on transforming the company, driving forward, driving forward at pace and having a plan that addresses comprehensively delivering transformative commercial initiatives, improving our operational efficiency and addressing capital allocation discipline. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Bob Jordan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey, good afternoon, everybody. On assigned seating, do you envision still being able to board an aircraft with just a single agent? Bob Jordan : Yes, absolutely, that would be the intent. We're still working on product design and some of the specifics. We have a lot of line of sight to the layout of the cabin. We have a lot of line of sight right now to the product design. We're working on the boarding. One of the things that we get a lot of credit for today, Jamie, is the calm and order of our boarding. We board in an ordinal manner in order and our customers that we survey, really like that. So there's a lot of focus on maintaining the boarding in form that our customers love, but doing it in a manner that it pairs with assigned seating. And again, more to share at our Investor Day but that would be the goal. And we want to do this whole thing, the Southwest way. And we're known for, obviously, things that make sense, common sense, not adding complexity. So if you look at the cabin, again, we're not ready to share everything, but we'll have a, again, a-third of the seats or so across the fleet in this extended leg room and there will be differentiation. It will be different than the rest of the cabin. But it won't a different seat and a curtain and meals and ovens. And so we'll do this in Southwest way. And the same exact thing applies to boarding. Jamie Baker : Perfect. Thanks. And second, and I don't know if you've ever commented on this in the past. But from a rapid rewards perspective, how important is Hawaii like, for example, could you disclose what percent of overall redemptions choose Hawaii, something like that? I'm just trying to model how important Hawaii is getting credit cards into people's wallets and driving brand profits, that kind of stuff? Thanks in advance. Bob Jordan : Jamie, it's very important, particularly as you think about the West Coast and the franchise, but I'll let Andrew take a crack at the details here. Andrew Watterson : Yeah. I can't recall off the top of my head, Jamie, but it is high. It's not as high as Aruba. Aruba is actually our highest redemption and that goes for kind of our East Coast customers who want a kind of aspirational vacation destination, and that allows under redeem for that. In the West, we have a very business-centric network in the West with leisure options being Vegas and Phoenix in season. So Hawaii is important to our customer franchise in the Western U.S. who are closer geographically to Hawaiian state of Florida for their beach and warm weather destination. So it's important for that customer base who is a repeat purchase customer base. So wrap rewards reflects someone who identifies their brand and wants in the credit cards, we have to have a multipurpose travel network for them and Hawaii is that for our Western US customers. So there -- that's one of the importance there and that why we spend so much time trying to mature doing so many adjustments to it to make sure it can fit profitably into our network as well as give that kind of customer adhesion point of aspirational vacation destination. Jamie Baker : That's good detail. Thanks very much. I would've not guessed the Aruba nugget. That's a good one. Thanks. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Just on the O&D revenue management system, you kind of shared a lot of details. It seems like you've had revenue management changes in the past that have kind of come up with some issues as well. But I was curious, I think, Bob, in your comment on CNBC, you mentioned that you just sold too many seats at too low prices. And I don't know, Ryan, if you want to kind of talk about you're seeing a lot of fair sales still out there, and that doesn't seem to jive with realizing that you've sold too many seats at too low prices. I was kind of curious if you could talk about the fair sale activity you're doing today and how we should interpret that? Bob Jordan : Yes. Maybe just talking about revenue management generally. The O&D systems are, by nature, more complex and it's not unusual that they take time to be tuned and adapted. And also we've had, not making excuses, but we've also had a lot of noise around the demand with scheduled changes, adapting to Boeing delivery issues and that's not help. But clearly, we sold too many seats early for the peak summer travel period, which means you're going to take them in lower booking classes. And it also means when you get to the summer and you have those strong flights, you have fewer seats to sell later in the booking curve, which obviously comes in higher booking classes. So we've had a strong diagnostic to understand what's happening. We've had experts -- third-party experts in to help. We have a strong action plan, and that action plan is being put into place right now. We're also adding more expertise, senior leadership over the area simply because it is more complex. Maybe tearing that apart a little bit from the fare sale. It's also clear and the RM system, it's also clear that there's simply more capacity than on the domestic side than demand right now. And so that's got to be a piece of what you're talking about. I mean for Southwest Airlines, we're taking actions for ourselves here. Capacity was up about 8-point, I think, 6% in the second quarter. We're going to moderate that to 2% in the third. It will actually be down roughly 4% in the fourth and sort of underneath that, trips will actually be down about 8% in the fourth quarter. So we are working down capacity aggressively on our part here. But yes, Andrew, you want to comment more specifically on RM? Andrew Watterson : I think I would say just in the fair sale, Bob, that can be a red hearing we get often. We distribute directly to consumers, which means you always have to be out there pulling them to your website and promotional activity is the way that you do that. So the frequency of our sales does not hold a special meaning. It's a depth of a sale that would give you indications about any kind of promotional level of discounts we're giving. In that situation, I don't think anything has really changed. If you look at the current sales. So kind of we always expect us to be out there promoting to customers from our website that often has have a number attached to it to get them there. But that's a normal course of business, has been that way through good times and bad over the years. Savi Syth : That's helpful clarification. And just if I might on the -- I know there's a lot more information coming at Investor Day, but I was curious on the -- for the changing of the seating on plane, once the FA approves it, just how long is that process generally to kind of doing a whole -- a large fleet like yours? Bob Jordan : You've got two \u2013 yes, you've got two -- maybe three sides here. You've got to finish up the design of the lopo or the layout, which we're very close to here. And then there's a much long certification process. And then, of course, we have roughly 800 aircraft that need to be modified. We're going to do this in a capital-efficient way. We don't -- we're going to utilize, obviously, the new RECARO coming off the line with new aircraft beginning early next year or existing seats. But an 800 aircraft, it still takes a while to move all the way through the fleet even if it's a relatively rapid modification. Obviously, it's a complex change, so you have technology, process, training, other work to be done. It will be a pacing item as well. But -- and again, we'll be revealing the time lines in more detail in September. So the only tidbit we have out there right now is that our plan is to sell in the new form. So in the assigned seating rolled beginning in 2025. But more to come. And again, the fleet -- the mod is not complex. It just has to be approved. And then again, we have to move through 800 aircraft in the fleet. Savi Syth : I'm one of those 80% of passengers who like to see the change. So we'll have to see that. Thanks. Bob Jordan : You want to. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Milius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Maybe just sticking on the premium stuff. So have you secured slots from an MRO perspective. And then you mentioned doing this on all 800 aircraft. I'm just curious on why you're doing the 700s if we're talking about retiring those over the next 10 years? And sorry for extra question on top of this. Like when you think about the layout, are you expecting the same amount of seats on each plane, not losing any seats by adding premium? Thank you. Bob Jordan : We're still -- and Ryan can add a lot of detail here. We're still working on specific lopos and layouts. We want to do this in a Southwest way and be true to our values here. So in the same manner that our intent is not to change our customer-friendly policies and take anything away from you. We want to have not just in the extra legroom section, but in the remainder of the cabin, we want to have an attractive pitch. So we're still working through that question. The 700s, they're going to be in the fleet for, I believe, for a while, for a long while here. And so again, we're going to be sharing the detail on the math as well, just the financial benefit but it's clear that a modification to the 7s, you want the extra legroom seats in the 700s as well. Sort of roughly the same. About one-third, desire to get the center or third of the seats across the entire fleet. And then just mechanically for our customers, it would make no sense to you\u2019re just buying a flight. So it make no sense to buy one flight and there are a lot of extra legroom seats and buy another flight and simply because that\u2019s a different aircraft type. There are none or very few. So we want to do this in a way that it makes sense to our customers and that extra legroom section is available on every single flight. Ryan Green : Yes, I think that's the most important part, Conor, is that when you start wrapping seating benefits, premium seating benefits into your overall value proposition, whether you're selling it as an ancillary or a fair, the customer, when they go on to buy their flight from Dallas to Denver. They don't know if we're going to operate it with the 700 or a MAX 8 aircraft, and you want a consistent value proposition across the board to serve the customers' needs. So I think that's the most important piece of that equation to your question there. Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then on the comment of growing at or below macro trends in 2025, I'm trying to understand why growth is even on the table right now given where returns are? In that same context, like you're talking about unit revenue down today, but then seats down 6% to 8% that inflects unit revenue positive. I just try to understand why we should then ramp back up in line with the economic growth. And then in the context of all that, can you just frame up how you view the current demand environment in general? Thank you again. Bob Jordan : Yes, Conor, you bet. And we are still working on 2025, so I wouldn't take anything as an exact number. That was a commitment, obviously, over the next number of years and obviously, commitment until we are able to earn our cost of capital here. So, we've not picked a number necessarily for 2025, but we are going to be managing, obviously, our capital expenditures aggressively. Tied to that, and we haven't talked about the red-eye flying, but we're also announcing that today which I'm really proud of. And our customers want it, but what it also does for us is it produces ASMs without having to buy extra aircraft. I mean, the aircraft are available, obviously, overnight. That and the sophisticated technology and processes going into turn management, but that's allowing us to take time out of the turn. The combination of those two things, the red-eye flying and then the turn compression will allow us to fund nearly all, if not all, capacity, 2025, 2026, 2027 through initiatives and do buying incremental aircraft and spending incremental CapEx. Conor Cunningham : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Hey, Conor. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Linenberg : Hey. Bob, I know you had mentioned earlier you talked about sort of capacity domestically running a bit higher than demand and maybe what was driving the price weakness. But how much of it do you think may also be attributable to just that more price-sensitive consumer who may be pushing back? I mean we are seeing that in other sectors and I would think that you tend to carry a healthy amount of that type of segment. Are you seeing it? Andrew Watterson : Hey Mike, it's Andrew. We're not seeing any specific thing in regards to customer segments that are pulling back, so to speak. I think sometimes because we aspire to have low fares, people assume we're going for a lower fluent passenger, which is not the case. And so we want to have low fares and high quality. As I mentioned earlier, we have large parts of our network, which are very high business contribution, which implies a customer that's relatively more affluent. And so we're seeing, I think, business travel actually grow faster than capacity both in Q1 and Q2. So, you do see that part of the economy going well. It's just, I think there's some choppiness with regards to off-peak times and how much leisure spending is going on there. That was a characteristic of COVID where people would more frequently take off trips for leisure reasons, and there's less of that now, and so that does create this kind of period of the year, where then there's more capacity than demand. Ryan Green : And Mike, just -- this is Ryan. Just to add a little bit of color to what Andrew said there. When you look at our customer base demographically and how that compares to our peers in the industry, it looks a lot more like -- our customer base looks a lot more like our legacy peers than it does LCCs or ULCCs -- the LCC or ULCC, peer set. Specifically, when you talk about households with incomes in the $100,000-plus bracket and $200,000 bracket that looks much closer to legacy than it does the LCC and ULCC peer set. Mike Linenberg : Great. Very helpful. And then just my last question, this may be for Tammy. When I look at your CASM guide for the year, which you were able to maintain, we come off the third quarter and at the midpoint, we're looking at, call it, 12% on a couple of percent of capacity. When we get to the fourth quarter, we're up maybe high single digits, but now that's on a capacity reduction of about 4%. So sequentially, there is a healthy improvement there. Is there something in 2023? I know there was a restatement, but is there anything in credits or one-timers that would allow you to see that sort of progression? Or maybe we're just anniversarying some of these some of these various contracts and cost inflationary items? Thanks for taking my question. Tammy Romo : Yeah. No, absolutely, Mike. And no, you -- there really isn't anything unusual to point out. We are anniversarying some of the contracts. So that is certainly contributing to that. And just to clarify on CASM-X numbers for last year. I know we've had, I think, some questions coming in on that just to make sure you all have the correct numbers. The specific numbers for the third quarter is $0.1067 and 4Q, it's $0.1097, bringing the full year to $0.1109. So just to make sure you've got all the right numbers in your model. But yeah, you got it. It's mostly anniversarying the contracts. Bob Jordan : And just to be -- just to break it down, I'm sure you know this -- sort of our normal -- if you look at our midpoint of our Q3 guide, 12, kind of normal would be low 4s. We've got close to five points of abnormal labor pressure with the new contracts. So as Tammy said, as you begin to anniversary that is material. And then between Boeing direct impacts and Boeing overstaffing impacts, you've got about three points. So as that tails off and the overstaffing begins to tail off, and we are mitigating a large number of that. We can talk about that later if you want. So as those extraordinary items come off, it's very helpful, or you anniversary them. Mike Linenberg : Great. Thank you. Bob Jordan : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask you about network changes versus product changes, things like assigned seats and which area you think will be the bigger contributor to your lagging margins here? Do you see a path on margin improvement before these product enhancements come on board? The only reason I ask is there are some carriers out there that have all the premium bells and whistles, but still have lagging margins, which suggests that premium in isolation is not a silver bullet. So is there a network issue and a new markets issue that we can address first? Andrew Watterson : Hi, Duane, it's Andrew. I would say there is obviously a lag with the implementation of the initiatives. So between now and then, we absolutely are aiming towards having margin improvement. I would actually put it on the back of three efforts, network changes many of which we've put in, and we will keep putting more in. You saw some big ones in Q1, and there's still some good modest-sized ones throughout the year this year. And then when the capacity is set then on the shorter duration, we're focused on yield improvements. You saw through the discussion about revenue management system, both the raising the negative that you saw in Q2, but also getting more out of the system is a positive on top of limiting the negative. So that's one factor. And then on the other is some -- we have a load gap and folks in that load gap in particular, you see our efforts on our new advertising campaigns, our entry into Google Flights and some of our customer acquisition activities help us to kind of broaden our customer base. It's down a little bit because we find that our road load don't travel as much per person as they did pre-pandemic. And so those efforts in the short to medium term will give a tailwind to load. So those marketing activities, originating activities and network changes, they are all 3 that we intend to work between now and the go-live of the initiatives. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate that. And we'll be watching for progress on that front. And Bob, in the spirit of your comment about looking at all opportunities, I wanted to ask you about bags and not from the traditional revenue perspective, but just from a Southwest take rate and cost per bag perspective, do you have a feel for how much higher your bag take rate is versus the rest of the industry? How many more bags per flight you carry and what you estimate your cost per bag to be? Bob Jordan : Yes. We -- I believe, just to get right your question and check bags, I believe we carry about 2x the industry standard. But then also, you've got bags that come out of the cabin that also has an issue in terms of how you manage the operation. Just to be real clear on bags-like-free as a policy, I mean, we're not looking at this point to change that policy. Our industry-leading set of initiatives of customer-friendly policies. And you know the list is a big part of what attracts people to Southwest Airlines. And after fair and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the number one issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest. So it's not something under consideration right now as we rethink our products related to the seating and the cabin. Andrew Watterson : I would say also, Bob, that as far as the cost, there can be breakpoints at certain volume scales in individual airports, but if you give any given flight having one or less bags or 10 or more or less bags, doesn't necessarily change the cost profile to handle that as the number of people and equipment required to load and unload the aircraft is static in that range. So there's not a variable cost as far as the handling part. Of course, the weight is variable with the fuel burn, but that would be the true if it was in the cabin instead of under the valley. Bob Jordan : Well, the thing you have to think about, too, is the bags move around. And so we're working to take -- and we'll share a lot about this at our Investor Day. We are working through technology and processes to take time out of a turn because your free time there and basically free aircraft just fall out because you're able to utilize the aircraft more effectively during the day. And we don't have a large issue today with cabin overhead bags that are then slowing down the operation because the overheads are slowing, they have to be moved down into the check and moved into the haul. So -- or the bin. And so you'll just move the issue around. I mean, I'm sure you've flown on others, and there's a massive last-minute checking of bags from the cabin down into the bin under the aircraft, and that cost you a lot of turn time potentially, which then just burns aircraft time that could be used more effectively. So it's a trade, and we do look at the trade. Ryan Green : And just to add one other point on that. It's about twice as many check bags. We carry as many check bags legacies, and it gets closer to three times more check bags than ULCC. So I think that, that just points to the popularity of the policy and goes to indicate why one of the reasons why customers choose Southwest Airlines. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So I know you're going to quantify the changes in September, but just directionally, should we be thinking hundreds of millions? Is it more -- any way to help us think about how much CapEx this requires. And then just more conceptually, like some of the legacies would say, hey, it's not just extra legroom that you need for it to truly be sort of premium, like -- are there other changes you're contemplating beyond just extra legroom? Bob Jordan : Yes, Scott, you bet. And again, yes, we're going to share a lot more in September, but just maybe just to put a ballpark figure out there, our ancillary products today around boarding, like early bird upgraded boarding, generate just shy of $1 billion for us. And the opportunity and the assigned seating and extra-legroom world is substantially north of that. So I'm not going to give you a range, but just maybe give you a little directional. And also, hopefully, giving you the stat that roughly a third of the seats in our fleet will be in the extra legroom configuration can give you kind of a ballpark there as well. There's very little CapEx to invest, because we're not buying a whole different configuration, that kind of thing. So it's mostly about adjusting the cabin more than it is buying a lot of stuff to change the cabin. We already have a new seat coming from RECARO that customers really like. We're already working on some of the other components of the cabin anyway. So there's actually very little incremental CapEx related to this change. Then maybe on your last point, we're still defining the products and exactly the detail around what we want to attach extra legroom. But again, just to be clear, we're not looking at first class where you really have a huge differentiation and where you really have a huge differentiation in cost. We really took a revenue per square foot view of a way to solve for this. You have so many fees in the cabin that you can deal with and maximizing that revenue per square foot is how we attack the problem. Scott Group : That's helpful. And just to clarify, when you talk about substantially north of $1 billion, do we -- is that a -- I'm trying to -- is that a gross number or net number? Meaning in theory, we'll lose like the early boarding in flight that we have today, I would assume? Bob Jordan : That's an incremental. So incremental too. In other words, obviously, hurdle -- one, if those products are generating shy of $1 billion whatever we do has to clear that as a hurdle. And so anything that we talk about will be the net change. But again, we're just not ready to share that in detail. But no, we wouldn't be making the change. If number one, it wasn't what our customers wanted. Number two, it wasn't what our employees wanted and number three, it wasn't significantly beneficial financially for our shareholders. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you, guys. I want to maybe ask about 2025 growth in a little different way. When you look at the contractual order book, it has 70 aircraft getting delivered plus ASMs from the red-eye aircraft. So how should we think about that in the context of at or below GDP growth? Are we getting to the point maybe where fleet growth needs to be net neutral? Do you accelerate retirement? How do we think about that? Tammy Romo : Yes. Hi, Sheila. Yes, we have a lot of flexibility with our order book from Boeing. We're not ready yet to lay out all of our plans. We'll do that out at Investor Day. But we have ample flexibility to reflow the order book to ultimately meet our needs. And we'll balance all of that clearly, given all of our objectives and including CapEx spend and also our initiative to renew the fleet. So we'll lay out all those details for you at Investor Day. Bob Jordan : And obviously, we're still working with Boeing on settling up against the issues that we've seen here with delayed deliveries and those late deliveries against plan continue into 2025. So again, more to share later on that as well. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. And then maybe one on cost to follow by them. With the red-eye buying, how do we think about additional head count required for that or any cost impact? Andrew Watterson : Yes. So Sheila, it's Andrew. The incrementality is quite low on this. Obviously, this fuel incrementality, but the nature of this is the aircraft apart the West, while it's still the operating day for those airports and then it arrives in the East during their operating days. So your staffing both in, so it doesn't require ground operations. We have a situation where we have ample pilots right now. And so does not require us to hire additional pilots to be able to operate the red-eye. So it's a way to kind of get more flying out of the current employee base in the current asset base for next year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Bob Jordan : And Sheila was our final analyst question. Julia Landrum : Thank you. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin taking your questions, Gary, can you remind everyone and shared instructions on how to queue up for a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alexandra Skores with The Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead. Alexandra Skores : Hi. Can you all hear me? Bob Jordan : We can, Allie. Alexandra Skores : Yeah, this feels like a very historic step for Southwest with regard to the changes in policy today. I wanted to ask, are we entering a new era? Is this a step towards a new era for the company? And how is Southwest going to kind of differentiate itself from other major air carriers because that's been the history of Southwest? So I'm wondering if you can kind of speak to that. Bob Jordan : We have -- we do it thoughtfully and carefully, but we've always been willing to adapt and change here at Southwest at the time that I've been here. And we always kind of hate about the plastic boarding passes, but we've made a lot of change. I will tell you, I do and think our team does view this as a strategic transformation of the company. We are making as we talked about, we've made significant and continuing investments in our operational capabilities. And you see it showing up. I mean, we've taken 16 million pieces of paper a year out of the cockpit. The turn is going completely paperless on iPads. If you fly out of Dallas and Baltimore and other stations, you'll see big ramp information displays up that are managing the turn and much, much more. And the investment in core technology there is allowing us to operate really well. I talked about it earlier, but we had an 8% cancel rate when the hurricane came through Houston and almost no cancels the following day, so the ability to recover. And you saw that when the global tech outage hit last week, and we ran basically a normal day. So those investments in the operation are more than tactical. They're really transformational investments to change the way we operate our resilience and reliability. And the same thing is going on in the commercial space. We are announcing the seating and the cabin changes today, but it's been a purposeful build that goes back two years to begin add power and larger bins and Wi-Fi, and we're reworking the cabin, and you have upgraded in different more modern uniforms coming to our crews. Our digital approach is significantly different. If you just go back maybe even 18 months, today, you can track your bags and you can do things that manage your same-day standby and there's much, much more to come on the digital front. So we do see this as a fundamental transformation of Southwest Airlines to meet our customers' needs to be more efficient and to add capabilities. All that said, we're not going to change the core of what we stand for here, true hospitality, the best employees in the industry, customer policies that make sense, being transparent with our customers. So we're going to we're going to adhere to the things that make Southwest, the Southwest you love, but we\u2019re going to make this an even better Southwest Airlines. Alexandra Skores : And then my second question, just for some of the Dallas passengers too, I've been noticing have been pretty vocal about concerns about how this will be implemented. And I know you're not sharing specifics, but one that they are rather interested in is family boarding and that's like a prime reason why folks come into love field and have localized that to me. Can you share anything about how family boarding might be implemented with this new policy? Bob Jordan : No. I mean we're -- and Ryan can talk about this. For still -- there are, as you could I would expect there are 1,000 details to be worked through. But if you just think about that as a family, especially if you're on a long-haul flight and the uncertainty in today's world, the uncertainty of are we going to be able to sit together is a huge question and it comes up as a stress point for families that we carry. And so in the new world, in the assigned seating world, you'd have an assurance that you're going to sit together because you have assigned seats that take that stress away. And if you want to sit together in an extra legroom section even better. And so I think for -- as we've surveyed a lot of what the changes are accomplishing are actually taking stress out of the boarding process and the seating process because most of the stress comes from where am I going to see it sit. Not just am I going to get \"a good seat\". But where am I going to sit, am I going to say close to the folks that I want to, for example. So, moving to assigned seating, takes all of that stress out of the process. The goals we talked about earlier is to marry the things that folks love about our boarding with that assigned seating change. But Ryan don't know if you want to add anything? Ryan Green : No, yes. I think moving -- there are friction points in the current customer experience that come along with open seating that we've had to adapt to by creating things like our family boarding section today. Just to give a little insight into that, almost 60% of customers are checked in within the first 30 seconds of the 24-hour check-in window opening. And that goes up to about 75% of customers checked in within the first hour. So, if you're a busy family and you don't hit the check-in window right on the nose, that causes anxiety. And so like Bob mentioned, this is one of those -- this is a way to solve lot of those friction points at the current open seating process has introduced and just causes more anxiety than we want. So I think families at the end of the day are going to love the change. Bob Jordan : And for employees, I mean our employees end up on the aircraft, if there is an issue, family boards late, there aren't seats together, the open seats together, our flight attendants end up having to manage that situation or police that situation. And if you are customers that are in the last boarding group and the flight is full, you get on board, and it's tough to see the open seats. So you have what we call spinners, people going up and down the aisle spinning and looking for the open seat because it's hard to see since the aircraft is full. So, that's obviously stressful and the assigned seating change basically eliminates all of that. Alexandra Skores : Great. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Please go ahead. Rajesh Singh : Hi, Bob, can you provide an update on your discussions with ALS management and do you expect a compromise with them that are threatening a proxy fight? Bob Jordan : Rajesh, I can't speak for Elliott or speculating on what Elliot may or may not do. But so far, they've not shown any willingness to engage in any meaningful conversations with us. Most of that has been public personal attacks on leadership in the Board. So like any shareholder, we love to engage and hear their feedback. And -- but so far, there's been no willingness on their part to do that. So for our part here as a leadership team, we're focused 100% on moving the company forward on the plans that -- some of which we laid out today and on transforming this company ending our desired financial returns. Rajesh Singh : Bob, my second question is that about premium seating. Have you done any calculation that how much of an investment will require? And what kind of boost it will provide to your revenue and earnings next year? Ryan Green : Yes. I think Rajesh, we'll have more to share on the overall value opportunity of the premium seating and assigned seating initiative at Investor Day this fall. On the cost side of the equation, we're doing it in a very capital efficient way. We're using existing -- existing seats. So there's a very little capital outlay here. And then on the revenue side, we'll have a value share here later in the fall. Rajesh Singh : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Yes. Hi. Actually, Alexandra asked some of my questions. But just as a follow-up, I'm curious how much did -- in regard to the open seating demise here. How much did the current gaming of the system factor in your decision? Bob Jordan : Hey, Dave, we haven't called it the demise of open seating. It's a shift to assigned seating, but anyway. I would say that it didn't factor in terms of the analysis. So we -- this is all about trying to make right decision and making it not in emotion, but in data. So we -- as Ryan can talk about, just extensive surveying of our customers or non-customers to understand their preferences. And then also to understand things like if you have status on Southwest today, you know your A-List preferred, what benefits how do you value benefits and what would be attached to your status in the assigned seating and extra legroom world, for example. So just a ton of effort there and then a ton of effort to understand the operational impacts, if any, because we certainly don't want a assigned seating to turn the aircraft slower, which everything that worked on proved that it will not. So it was really about the change itself we do know for our employees, in particular, managing the boarding process, as you described, can be stressful and it can be for some of our customers. So while that wasn't a direct item that we studied, I think it could be that, that is an indirect benefit that we see. David Koenig : Okay. And I think you kind of -- I have heard from your earlier remarks, Bob, that you were surprised by the degree to which people wanted to see assigned seating. And I don't know what your history, what baseline polling you had or surveys. Is that something that happened very recently? And is it because of the encouraging more passengers to pay extra to move up in the line? What was timing there? Bob Jordan : Yes. I think customers' preferences shift over time. And I think it's been clear, I think their preferences shift over time and travel patterns and travel behavior shift over time. Customers are just taking fewer short-haul trips today. They are flying longer. And when they fly longer, the importance of an assigned seat goes up. We've talked a lot about our desire and initiatives to grow market share with corporate business travelers in the managed business space, and they -- their preference is for an assigned versus an open seat. And so I think that that goes into it. And then when you look at premium, premium, just -- you can see it with in the airline industry ourselves, premium product growth has outpaced the growth in main cabin revenue for some time here. And then in other parts of the economy, consumers are just reducing nonessential retail purchases and spending that on experiences. So it's a combination of travel patterns changing and customer preferences changing over time that we're adapting to here. David Koenig : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Lori Aratani with The Washington Post. Please go ahead. Lori Aratani : Hi. Thank you for pointing out of the queue. Sort of building on what David asked and what you just said, Bob, customers are sickle, right? And their preferences change. So are you worried that this is what everyone wants now a few years back, the legacies were moving to basic economy, right? Because that was the hot concept. Do you worry that you're going to make this change? And then a couple of years from now, people are going to want something different. Bob Jordan : No, I don't think I said customers are fickle. Just kidding. But no we... Lori Aratani : Okay, sorry about that. They have been changing, I guess. Bob Jordan : No, no, I'm kidding with you. I mean, preferences do change over change over time, and they sometimes long periods of time. And just more philosophically, you can have beliefs. We as a company can have beliefs and hold on to them. But if you don't understand in data, what is happening with your customers, that they can move away from you. So you've got to be willing to challenge everything that's not fundamental to you as an airline. But the -- we do -- we have periodically surveyed assigned seating. This is by far the deepest analysis we have ever done. And it has moved towards assigned seating over decades. I think the last time we looked at it, which was years -- many -- actually several years ago, the preference was more 50-50. But the -- you've got a different generation -- you've got -- what we're trying to point out too is, it's very clear that as different generations emerge and spend more on travel, their preferences are potentially very different than the prior generation. I mean, not making a value call at all, but you've got to aim because you're always working, you've got to aim at the customer that you're going to see in five years and 10 years. So I don't worry that -- the -- the fact this is what I love about way we're implementing this. We're not doing anything way out on the front. We're moving to assigned seating. We're moving to extra legroom, and we're doing it in a way that is consistent with Southwest Airlines, which is we're doing it in a very efficient way. And we're not putting in seats with -- that have doors and seats that massage you or something like that. We're doing things that make sense for Southwest. So I'm comfortable that we're moving towards the customer and that those customer desires will not shift on us. Lori Aratani : Okay. Can I sneak one more in because we have readers that are, of course, very engaged in this. Do you guys -- have you worked out yet what this is going to mean for A-List A \u2013, the folks that have A-List status? Bob Jordan : That's part of what we are hard at work finalizing. Now I think it's safe to assume that just like our current A-List, A-List preferred customers, there is a boarding benefit associated with their status level. I think it's safe to assume that there will be a seating benefit, seating benefits that are associated with it. But the exact nature of that and the details there are things that we're defining as we speak. Lori Aratani : Great. Thank you so much. Bob Jordan : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. I just wanted to ask a safety-related question. Obviously, the FDA review is just starting or hasn't yet started. But as you internally look at some of the incidents that you've had recently, are there any common themes that are emerging, are there any lessons learned or changes that you're thinking about implementing to training or procedures? Bob Jordan : Yes. And Ali, I'll let, obviously, Andrew talk in detail, but I did want to take time before our call in just to -- just reiterate that there is nothing more than important and safety period. We have had recent issues. We take them very seriously. Andrew can talk about it, but we've got a team focused on understanding what happened and how we can improve. I did speak to FA administrator, Whittaker, earlier this week to reinforce our commitment, my personal commitment to safety and our support and really appreciation for the work that the FAA is doing. So I just want to preface anything we say about the issues with the fact that there is nothing more important than safety and we fully support the FAA. Andrew Watterson : Bob, I don't know that the -- it's not just the words we say safety is the priority, it's in our actions as well. So efforts started actually in April. We noticed some things that caught our eye. We merited further involvement from us. So within the construct of our safety management system, we engaged our flights safety personnel within the company with the representatives from our pilots union, their safety committee as well as the FAA and our certificate management office to set up a joint team to do some joint analysis and investigation of what are root cause drivers and what are actions we can take in the short-term and the medium-term. Some of the short-term actions was about enhanced communication and transparency because aviation safety today is based upon that kind of -- that transparency and collaboration. So that actually led to us communicating proactively to our personnel about what's going on, which then, of course, led to these things getting out in the press and getting more media. So there's a little bit of self-reinforcing there. But we clearly saw issues, and we clearly see things that we need to work on. So we have been, since that time, as we've dug into it, increased our focus and tempo on it. And the FAA now has increased theirs as well. So this is a carrier strictly holder evaluation process. It's something that every airline goes, roughly every five years, but it can be voted off cycle. The FAA \u2013 that was one other airline this year. Now they're doing with us, they can either do a kind of broad-based review or kind of audit or focus. They've chosen here as a focused effort for us. And so we expect that to begin here in the coming weeks and finite duration. However, the other work we already started will continue that process should always be ongoing. And so they can we can -- both sides can flex in additional resources from inside companies, inside organizations as well as outside. So this is a multilayer approach to safety, and I think it makes us better, but also it gives the FAA the more visibility to bring back into the rest of the aviation system and vice versa because a lot of the topics we see other airlines see and vice versa. So we're super happy to have this kind of great relationship and joint investigations. Alison Sider : And I know a couple of the incidents seems to have involved less experienced first officers or people new in their seats. Is there anything that you're looking at specifically to address that issue? Andrew Watterson : No. I would say that what we're looking at in new product, internal communications is a human factor. So it's not the experience or airmanship necessarily of an individual. It's what's called kind of generically in the industry cockpit resource management. The how you interact between the pilot flying and the pilot monitoring. There's insights to be gained there. And I think that's what we're focused on. We've brought in external health, the FAA has bring external health. And they've told us they've seen some other things elsewhere that would be helpful to us. So this is a more about that dynamic than there's about any specific demographic. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on that. Andrew, what did you see back in April that triggered the Southwest review? Was it some of the specific incidents that have been reported, or was it something else? And then the second question is if this is a focused investigation from the FAA or focus review. Is that focused solely on pilot training and just all focus on pilots or what is the focus? Andrew Watterson : There is a focus on flight operations and pilot training, but there's a couple of items as well that will be finalized as they start up. So it's not everything. It's a handful of items. And with regards to what color eyes, we had two flights in particular in April that had some similarities that caught our eye and let us start this process. So that was one too many, if you will, and that's when we started up ASAP. Really, literally within days of us seeing that, we started the joint exercise with the FAA and our pilots union. Mary Schlangenstein : And can you be more specific on what the similarities were? What problem did you see? Andrew Watterson : Well, I won't go into too much detail. I mentioned aviation safety is based on transparency and collaboration is part of that's voluntary disclosure. So since individual actors in the aviation safety system to self-disclose things that they saw, that they did in exchange for indemnity from that. And so I'm not at liberty to go into exactly what it is there, but you can see where the programs we've launched, you can see what the FAA has launched and how these things all fit together. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session for media. So, back to Whitney now for some closing thoughts. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks everyone. If you have any further questions, our communications group is standing by. Their contact information, along with today's news release are all available at swamedia.com. Thank you. Operator : The conference you concluded. Thank you all for attending. We'll meet again here next quarter.",

A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s remarks, there is an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you so much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airline's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer; Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Bob will start us off by reviewing the key points from our Southwest Even Better framework introduced last month at Investor Day and cover how our third quarter results reflect initial progress against our plan. He will then turn it over to Andrew to share updates on our revenue and our industry-leading operational performance. Tammy will follow to discuss our cost performance, balance sheet and capital allocation before turning it back over to Bob who will provide a brief statement on Elliott Investment Management, after which we will move into Q&A. Ryan Greene, EVP of Commercial Transformation is also in the room with us today to support Q&A. A quick reminder that we will make forward looking statements, which are based on current expectation of future performance and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings press release. Our press release with third quarter 2024 results and a supplemental presentation that includes additional details on the expected EBIT contributions of our planned initiatives, as well as the draft initiative scorecard were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob. Bob Jordan : Thanks, Julia, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you know, we laid out our Southwest Even Better transformational plan a few weeks ago at Investor Day. It's a plan designed to deliver increased value for our shareholders and our customers. And since then, we've engaged with many of our shareholders and I truly appreciate the constructive feedback. The message is simple. Now that we have set out a clear path, it's all about executing and that's exactly what the team and I will be discussing today. Before turning to that, I want to recognize the widespread devastation caused by recent hurricanes and communities across the Southeast. While we were able to quickly recover our operation, we know that for so many, it will take much longer. We're leaning on our National Disaster Response Partners, providing financial donations, and offering complimentary travel to aid in the recovery efforts. Our employee catastrophic assistance charity is currently assisting all employees requesting support to ensure that they are cared for and receive immediate relief. Our hearts are with our employees and our communities as they recover and rebuild. Returning to the business, I'll start by reiterating the path we laid out and how our third quarter results reflect initial progress against our plan. As we shared at Investor Day, our plan is detailed, actionable, and highly intentional. We are fully committed to delivering the robust set of tactical and strategic initiatives we presented in restoring the financial prosperity that our plan supports and at Southwest and our shareholders expect. That includes a steady marks to delevering ROIC of 15% or higher, well above our cost of capital in 2027 even without tailwinds from our fleet strategy. As part of the plan, we provided specific targets for capacity, operating margin, ROIC, leverage, and free cash flow in 2027. While we have work to do, all actions to achieve those goals are well underway and progressing as planned. The team and I are accountable for delivering on the planned results and being transparent regarding our progress. To that end, we included a scorecard and supplemental detail this morning that we will use to report on progress against initiative development and expected financial results, including updates on critical milestones and the status of meaningful value capture going forward. We also included additional detail this morning on the composition of the initiative-driven EBIT contributions and how that builds between now and 2027, including additional clarification on the contribution from our fleet strategy. At the highest level, our plan builds as follows : value at 2025 is driven by improving the base business, executing tactical and efficiency initiatives and building the capabilities to launch our strategic initiatives. Value is created in 2026 through strategic initiatives coming online, with the most significant value being unlocked through the introduction of assigned and premium seating options. Finally, value in 2027 is created by the initiative portfolio hitting run rate, where initiatives aimed at the core operation are sized at roughly $3.5 billion of cumulative incremental EBIT contribution and this includes full realization of the cost plan. When you add the estimated benefit from the fleet strategy, you get a $4 billion of total incremental EBIT that we shared at Investor Day. Importantly, we do not view the fleet monetization strategy as part of our core business. While the combination of a favorable secondary market and our attractive aircraft pricing provides a unique and lucrative opportunity to both significantly reduce our aircraft CapEx and drive earnings accretion, we feel confident that we can achieve all of our 2027 targets even without the benefits expected from our fleet monetization strategy. Looking at the second half 2024, we are encouraged by both positive results from our recent actions and by recent industry trends. We are highly confident in our ability to deliver on our plan. In terms of tactical initiatives, everything is progressing in line with what is needed to hit our 2025 commitments. We had third quarter record operating revenues of nearly $7 billion and a unit revenue increase of 2.8% compared to last year. The improvement in unit revenue reflects both a more constructive, industry backdrop, and a proof point of our effective execution. Improvements resulting from our revenue management actions are particularly encouraging. The team is focusing on improving yields on our best-performing flights, while achieving a non-dilutive load strategy on our lower demand itineraries. While not yet in the run rate, we saw better-than-expected improvement in 3Q and we are pleased to see all months in 4Q tracking as expected. Our strategic initiative work is also progressing as planned. On the seating and cabin front, we are working actively with both regulatory agencies and vendor partners towards successful approval and certification of our new premium cabin configurations. That would allow aircraft retro fits to begin early next year. We will start with our larger aircraft and the 700s will follow. We are planning to retrofit 50 to 100 aircraft per month, completing the work late next year. We are also announcing today that we have signed our first three direct lodging partners for our Getaways by Southwest product that is planned to launch mid next year and that includes Caesars Properties in Las Vegas. And finally, we are narrowing the launch date of our previously announced partnership with Icelandair for the first quarter of 2025. Looking at cost and efficiency of initiatives, we continue to expect to end this year with headcount down 2,000 as compared to year end 2023. Improved turn times are reflected in existing schedules starting in November and red-eye service will begin next February. We're also very proud of our industry-leading domestic operational reliability. We had the best completion factor and on time performance of any major airline this quarter and Andrew will share additional highlights shortly. Regarding progress on our fleet monetization strategy, we're already starting actively exploring the market and are encouraged by what we are seeing. All that said, while our financial results are demonstrating improvement, I recognize that, we still have a lot of work to do to fulfill our commitment to return to prosperity. We have a great plan and I'm confident in our ability to execute and deliver, and we will be transparent about progress and results along the way. It's a really exciting time at Southwest. I want to take a moment to recognize all the efforts by our incredible employees who are committed to making this plan a reality. Thank you for all your extraordinary dedication. Our continued transformational progress would not be possible without all of you. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all for joining us today. To start, I want to emphasize how proud I am of our talented team and resilient operations that enabled Southwest to lead the industry with the best on-time performance and completion factor of any major domestic airline in the third quarter. We managed to achieve these outstanding results despite a quarter filled with challenging weather, including four named hurricanes. Overall, our third quarter completion factor was 99.3% even with critical parts of our network impacted by storms. These weather challenges continued into the fourth quarter most recently with Hurricane Milton, where our operating teams coordinated incredibly well and we're able to plan in ways that allow for proactive cancellations with minimal disruption. In the face of these events, we remain steadfastly focused on safely delivering strong operational performance, prioritizing the well-being of our people and supporting impacted communities. Turning now to revenue performance for the quarter. As Bob mentioned, benefits from the tactical initiatives we have implemented are reflected in the strength of both our nominal and unit revenue growth rates, and are aided by a more constructive supply-demand environment with Southwest contributing significantly to capacity rationalization. Bob covered the improvements we are seeing from our revenue management action plan, which are evidenced by the yield improvements from the work we did to recalibrate our systems and processes to better optimize the booking curve for our highest demand flights. Third quarter managed-business revenue also grew nicely with double-digits year-over-year improvement. This was driven largely by GDS bookings and the success of our investment in Southwest Business. We are continuing to see an increase in unique customers, up 7% year-over-year, deeper penetration of our existing accounts with 76% of the new individual travelers won over the quarter coming from existing corporate accounts, and finally strong yield performance. Looking at booking trends, we are serving more managed-business customers than ever, but they continue to take fewer trips per year and therefore occupy fewer seats than they did pre-COVID. So we continue to see opportunities to grow our managed-business and backfill those seats with new customers. As such, we also continue to focus on initiatives aimed to include network changes and distribution and marketing initiatives. Starting with our network schedules from August 4th are designed to recalibrate supply to demand. This includes aligning capacity demand in specific geographies and also to seasonal and holiday demand patterns. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have created multiple schedules to adjust down for lower periods including the anticipated election trough and then increased flight activity to capitalize on peak holiday demand. While we have made changes, we are seeing positive results and we expect to see additional benefits from changes in our 2025 schedules. We also continue to extend the reach for our distribution in a low cost fashion by adding new metasearch partners including Google Flights and Kayak earlier this year and just this month Skyscanner. These channels have introduced Southwest to new customers and strengthen our presence in points of sale where we have traditionally been weaker. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, as a result of our actions, capacity is projected to be down approximately 4% year-over-year with seats and trips down about 8%. We anticipate seeing the benefits for initiatives and the capacity moderation, as RASM inflected positive in August and we continue to see sequential RASM acceleration into the fourth quarter. With that, we expect fourth quarter RASM to be up in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. The range contemplates just under 0.5 point headwind for booking cancellations associated with Hurricane Milton earlier this month. In addition to these revenue initiatives, a key part of our strategic plan is reducing operating inefficiencies and increasing asset productivity. These efforts are clearly paying off. For example, we continue to have industry-leading turn time. We want to do even better. To that end, we have a plan to reduce our minimum turn, the time when the plane is unproductive at the gate by five minutes by November 2025. As we previously shared, this initiative is well underway and the reductions already built in the next month schedule for 12 of our stations. The turn initiative will make our current fleet more productive and create the equivalent of 16 free aircraft, at system-wide implementation. As more investments come into the day-to-day operation, we are confident that the Southwest turn will be a unique competitive differentiator. In addition to reducing turn times, the introduction of red-eye flight is another key component of increasing asset productivity and improving the connectivity and efficiency of the network. The June 2025 base schedule with 33 daily red-eyes will be published next week on October 30. As a reminder, the turn in Redeye initiatives allow us to have modest year-over-year capacity growth of 1% to 2% in 2025 and limit our planned aircraft CapEx exclusively for fleet modernization. To recap, we are focused on delivering on our tactical initiatives to drive financial performance and we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize our network, advance our revenue management capabilities and strengthen our marketing distribution activities. Before I close, I want to express my gratitude to our people for their focus on safety and warrior spirit, which allows us to drive industry leading operational excellence and provide our renowned Southwest hospitality. We could not do it without them. With that, I'll turn it over to Tammy to share updates on our financial performance. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Andrew, and hello everyone. As Bob mentioned, just a few weeks ago we presented our plans to transform Southwest to make our company even better, including outlining how these plans will restore our financial prosperity and drive sustainable shareholder value. We're focused on moving swiftly and deliberately to execute our plan, controlling what we can and adapting as needed. We have the right team in place supported by our incredible people whose warrior spirit, hard work and continued focus will help us deliver these results. I am so appreciative of each and every one of our amazing and dedicated employees. As Bob and Andrew spoke to the macro, revenue and operational performance, I will start with our cost performance and then cover fleet, balance sheet and capital allocation update. Looking at our cost performance, overall our third quarter CASM-X increased 11.6% year-over-year on a better end of expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect continued cost pressure driven primarily by new labor contracts and over staffing with additional pressure from the lower capacity including over 0.5 point of unexpected unit cost headwind from flight cancellations associated with Hurricane Milton. We currently estimate our fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 11% to 13% year-over-year. We are deliberately pursuing actions to mitigate cost inflation. Looking ahead, we are in a much more stable position. We have ratified all 12 of our labor contracts, creating better cost certainty over the next three years for our largest cost item. We've implemented voluntary leave and time off program that allow us to reduce our over-staffing impact. In addition, we outlined a cost plan at Investor Day, aimed at enhancing cost efficiency, which includes improving efficiencies in our ground operations and optimizing our operations around our new labor rules. As we shared, we expect savings from the opportunities we have identified to ramp over the next three years and reach over $500 million in run rate cost savings in 2027. This demonstrates our commitment to drive efficiency and preserve or improve our relative cost performance. Again, benefits from the fleet monetization strategy would be incremental to these savings. Our third quarter fuel cost of $2.55 per gallon was in line with our expectations and as we have seen fuel prices come down recently. We now estimate fourth quarter fuel to be in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range. Turning to our fleet. This is one of the key areas, where we're seeing our prudent planning and ability to adapt really pay off. We came into the year expecting to receive 79 Boeing aircraft deliveries. In March, Boeing informed us, we would receive 46. After going through a detailed process, we conservatively planned for 20 deliveries in April to reduce the risk of further operational impacts. As we close out the year, we have received 19 aircraft and expect to receive one more, exactly in line with our internal expectations. In the third quarter, we pulled forward the retirement of six additional -700s in the 2024 bringing our count for this year to 37-700 retirements and 4-800 lease returns for a total of 41 retirements. We shared our plans to opportunistically monetize the value of our fleet and order book at Investor Day. As a reminder, we are funding annual capacity growth of 1% to 2% over the next three years through our turn time, modernization and Redeye flying, which results in access to more aircraft than we need to fund our capacity plans. Therefore, the combination of a favorable secondary market, our attractive aircraft pricing and the excess aircraft available in our order book provides us a unique opportunity to reduce our aircraft CapEx and drive earnings accretion. We plan to capitalize on this opportunity through both sales and sale leasebacks. We will pursue our fleet monetization strategy with a focus on delivering a positive NPV across the portfolio of sale leaseback transactions. We're actively exploring the market and are encouraged by what we're seeing. Again, we consider our fleet strategy as incremental to our core business. As such, we provided additional breakout of the EBIT contribution in our supplemental third quarter earnings materials available on our Investor Relations website. Given the complexity of the transaction, the competitive nature of the market and the fluidity of new aircraft deliveries, we are going to limit the level of detail provided on future transactions that we are planning. Of course, we will update you as we close deal. Regardless, our plan comfortably supports all of our 2027 Investor Day financial targets without benefits from our fleet strategy. Ultimately, we remain committed to achieving our ROIC goal and in doing so have committed to longer-term capacity discipline. With this discipline and the plans we have outlined, we believe, we are well-positioned to achieve ROIC greater than or equal to 15% in 2027, which is well in excess of our WACC. Our expected capital spending for this year is approximately $2.1 billion of which just under $1 billion is aircraft CapEx excluding any impact from our fleet strategy. Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty around future aircraft availability, given continued challenges at Boeing. We have taken this risk into consideration in our 2025 contingency planning. While planning and re-planning remain a challenge, our moderated capacity plan reduces our need for new aircraft, and we have a lot of flexibility to make further adjustments with planned retirements. Boeing production is something we are watching closely and will defer providing more detail on CapEx and additional 2025 guidance until we have a better line of sight to an updated order book. Finally, our balance sheet remains a lasting competitive advantage and we continue to be the only airline with an investment grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. We ended the third quarter in a net cash position with cash and short-term investments of $9.4 billion and a fully available revolving credit line of $1 billion for total liquidity of $10.4 billion well in excess of our $8 billion of outstanding debt. We remain committed to providing significant returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have returned more than $13.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010, including $431 million in dividends to shareholders this year. As we announced at Investor Day, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to be significantly earnings accretive. And as we announced this morning, we will soon be launching an initial ASR under this authorization. So as we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we have a strong financial foundation and compelling plan to support our return to prosperity and strong shareholder return. We have a comprehensive and measurable plan that we expect will enable us to cover our WACC in 2026 and achieve after-tax ROIC of at least 15% in 2027. There is a significant body of work underway and we believe we are taking all the necessary steps to deliver. And With that, I will turn it back over to Bob. Thank you. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Tammy. Before we go to Q&A, I want to briefly address our recent settlement with Elliott, last night. The Board has taken a lot of time to engage with shareholders and get feedback and taken significant steps, based on that feedback. There's been a lot of Board refresh that has already begun and is ongoing and we're very pleased to have come to a collaborative resolution with Elliott. As we welcome our new members to our Board, all of whom, I had a chance to interview and talk to and get to know, our focus remains on executing our plan and that's exactly what we are going to do. I can promise you it all lies forward here as we work to set up Southwest for success for generations to come. With that, I'll pass it back to Julia to start our Q&A session. Julia Landrum : Thank you, Bob. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now transition to analysts\u2019 questions. We'd like to get to as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Gary, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Stephen Trent with Citi. Stephen Trent : Yes. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my questions. I will just curious, when we think about your CASM for 2025 and going forward. How are you thinking about your goals with respect to sale leaseback gains in the event that you might not receive equipment at the pace at which you're currently expecting? Bob Jordan : Hi, Steve. First I would just say, we obviously, as you just think about our unit cost generally today there are costs in there that are really one time step-ups, things like labor, new labor agreements and you have costs in there like the hurricane that are one-time pressures that don't occur and items like the labor step-ups obviously we will lap those. But there's a lot of work in our transformational plan that we put in front of you a few weeks ago. A lot of that's around efficiency like the red-eyes and compressing time out of the turn, driving aircraft efficiency, and then there's cost plan that we're committed to fully realizing by 2027. And so, looking at '25 and beyond, just going to you're thinking about run rate, we're just not ready to guide yet. There's a lot of uncertainty out there with Boeing, in particular. You saw that the contract was not approved. And so, it's just early to be able to guide the year at this point. Obviously, it's something that we're very focused on. Tammy if you want to add anything. Tammy Romo : The only thing I might add is, just in regard to your question on the sale leasebacks, obviously we have flexibility there and those we would keep in our fleet for some period of time. We continue to have opportunities there on the sale leaseback front and again just a lot of flexibility to manage to the targets that we laid out at Investor Day. Operator : The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Good afternoon, everyone. I was just wondering if you could share from a revenue trend perspective. Just what you're seeing on the managed corporate side, as well as kind of generally how the quarter is progressing given the noise? I know you called out the hurricane Milton impact here, but just wondering if there's anything else in the quarter that we should consider that's going to be on the core? Andrew Watterson : With regards specifically to managed business, we did see during the hurricane, there was a dip in managed business travel, because as you might imagine in that geography. And so, that did have a dip down, but then it bounced back up after the both hurricanes went through, kind of returned to its previous run rate. We don't see any structural change in demand for business travel at this point in time. Bob Jordan : And then, Savi, just generally on revenues, obviously, here in the fourth quarter and the holidays period looks strong as well. We're really pleased that, you saw our unit revenue performance in third. We saw -- with the actions that are being taken in revenue management and network and in distribution marketing, we saw an acceleration in the trends across the quarter and that continues here into the fourth quarter. So a good tailwind from the actions that are being taken, so I'm very pleased with that. More to come, but we're on track in terms of the performance out of those tactical actions that we need to hit what we told you concerning 2025 goals at Investor Day. Savi Syth : Appreciate that. Tammy, if I might follow-up on the previous question, when it comes to sale leasebacks, given the Boeing delivery uncertainty, is the consideration that includes like existing aircraft in the fleet that you could do sale leasebacks or how are you thinking about that, the progression? Tammy Romo : Yes, thanks Savi. That's exactly right. Obviously aircraft in our fleet are certainly eligible. It would include existing aircraft in our fleet. Again we have a lot of flexibility, I believe when it comes to the sale leasebacks. With regard to outright sales, obviously, we would pace those, based on, that would be informed by Boeing and the delivery schedule. We've got some work to do here, given the news that was out yesterday. Operator : The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. Not to beat a dead horse, but certainly appreciate for competitive reasons, you might not want to be that specific, but many investors left the Investor Day with the perception that fleet monetization over the three year time horizon, only means sale-leaseback gains. Is that how investors should be viewing? Is that the right takeaway, or is it more than that specifically on the new side? Tammy Romo : Duane, it would include potential sales and that's over the three year period. We'll just have to obviously consider the fluidity of the situation at Boeing. But just again we have 694 aircraft in our order book and with our moderated capacity plans we don't need that many airplanes. So we'll manage accordingly based on what's thrown our way with regard to the situation at Boeing. But certainly in the near-term we have opportunities without consideration for a sale leaseback. So, as always the world is constantly changing, but we again just have a lot of flexibility and we'll take the news that we all heard yesterday into consideration, as we solidify our plans for next year. Bob Jordan : Yes, Duane. I thought we were clear, my apologies, I thought we were clear at Investor Day that, we will be monetizing the value that is in the fleet order book. It could be sale-leasebacks, it could be direct sales. We'll be flexible on that front, and obviously take into account where we are, what the market looks like, but I think we're open to whatever approach maximizes that value. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And certainly appreciate the uncertainty with respect to fleet next year, but can you give us any high-level shaping on cost trends, non-fuel cost trends maybe first half, second half is the down one to three I think in the first quarter, is that new information, or was that kind of your thinking at Investor Day? Just to put a bow on it, like, when do you expect unit revenue growth to exceed non-fuel cost growth? Thanks for taking the questions. Tammy Romo : Yes, Duane, what you were referencing was our capacity guidance. Duane Pfennigwerth : Exactly, yes. Tammy Romo : Yes. We didn't provide CASM-X guidance for next year, and we'll come back given the moving parts here at our next earnings call and give more specific guidance for next year, but our targets that we provided at Investor Day with regard to our operating margins all of that still stands. Operator : The next question is from Tom Fitzgerald with TD Cowen. Tom Fitzgerald : Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for the time. Would you mind providing us an update with where things stand with your revenue management system? Is that giving you a tailwind now or what's the latest on that? Andrew Watterson : Thanks, Tom. It's Andrew. I would classify the system and processes and organization together. It wasn't just one thing, it's a combination of factors, and we put those into place in late Q2. And if you recall, we forecasted a two point drag to Q3 and we ended up with just a one point drag in Q3. That shows that we saw an inflection point in that. We highlighted I think at Investor Day that, August was particularly inflection point, where we saw that particularly the last half of August. And so, we've recalibrated our system, hired new people, put in place new processes and new tooling to support them and that is driving yield growth on our strongest flights, which is the objective. So we can see the intended actions are manifesting in actual outcome, so it gives us confidence that this is working for us. Tom Fitzgerald : Thanks very much. That's really helpful, Andrew. And then any color it seems like inter island fares in Hawaii have been picking up lately. Are you seeing any benefit from that? Andrew Watterson : My pleasure. Hawaii we view as a franchise, but knowing there's different parts to your franchise and we've seen results of our focused efforts that we mentioned in Investor Day. We are seeing RASM increase quite significantly above system RASM which is as you saw from our results also increasing and that is both for inter-island and Mainland to Hawaii. So we are pleased with the progress. We have teams that are cross-functional teams that are organized to focus and drive this and we are seeing the results of those efforts and those continue and will continue until we reach our business case. Bob Jordan : And you've got future actions coming next year around modestly moderating inter-airline capacity and then adding red-eyes and really helping connections and a connecting complex back to the mainland. So all that should continue to drive improvement as well on top of what you're seeing already today. Operator : The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So I apologize for turning this into a sale leaseback call, but I am still a little confused because I think I heard something different at the Analyst Day than what I just heard. So maybe Tammy, can you just clarify. The 3% to 5% margin for next year, does that include or exclude any potential sale-leaseback? And then, just separately on the cost side. I know we talk a lot about CASM, but if I just looked, third quarter has got employees down 1% and labor cost up 18% year-over-year. I know we've got like new contracts, but I don't know that, they're up that much. Can you just help us understand like why labor costs are up so much? Tammy Romo : Yes. On your first question on the margin guidance that was provided at Investor Day, we provided a range. The low end of that range would be without the fleet monetization strategy and the high end of that range contemplates our fleet strategy, which is why we provided you a range so you can think of it more or less with or without the fleet strategy. Hopefully that clarifies on that. And then, with regard to the cost pressures, looking ahead, I guess as a starting point, we would expect for next year just our normal inflationary cost pressure to continue. Keep in mind, an important input into all of that is our moderated capacity growth. As we've already shared we will be moderating our capacity growth next year. And then, we'll also have cost associated with the investment and the launch of our assigned seating and premium seating initiatives and but offsetting we realized savings from our cost plan. Again, we'll provide more insight into all of that on our next earnings call. But the inflation cost obviously was much more significant and as Bob said we'll be lapping some of the abnormal labor cost pressures, but there is just normal annual inflationary cost pressures baked into our labor contracts and that includes also some work rule changes as well. So, that is all factored into again the guidance that we gave you for next year for an operating margin in the 3% to 5% range. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Scott's question was the same as mine. So we should interpret today's 3% to 5% margin as essentially a guidance lift versus last month since fleet initiatives are now separate, correct? Tammy Romo : No. There's no change here and what we said at Investor Day, Jamie, is it's the 3% is ex fleet on operating margin and the 5% would include fleet. Bob Jordan : Yes, Jamie, for each year, there was a page in there that we had an operating margin range and we had an ROIC range. And the way to think about that is, one is without fleet base business and one is with fleet. And then I think for 2027, we said that the ROIC greater than or equal to 15% would be exceeded with and without fleet. So yes, the ranges were intended to provide you with and without fleet number. And then I think we also clarified that the fleet contribution was roughly $500 million a year. Jamie Baker : Okay. And so the change in tone, Bob, in your prepared remarks and in the answers on this topic, what drove that? Was that something maybe Elliott pushed for or was it just sort of trying to clear up misperceptions? I'm just curious. And also why it's not just called out as a special item? Bob Jordan : On the fleet? Jamie Baker : Yes, yes. Bob Jordan : No, no. Yes, no, nothing -- in fact, I thought we were clear at Investor Day about the -- with and without. And then on the scorecard or scorecard that we presented today added even more clarity around the decomposition, but then also the -- with and without fleet and then the fleet of composition across the year. So no, it had nothing to do with -- no, no connection to Elliott at all. Now in subsequent -- no, after Investor Day, as you would have guessed, we did a lot of shareholder engagement discussions, and one of the items was, hey, a little more clarity on the EBIT stack in '27 and some of the things you just talked about, which is why we added that into the presentation that was filed this morning. Jamie Baker : Got it. And then for my second topic, just quickly on loyalty. It seems to me that with the LOPA changes and the plans to better monetize the cabin that there could be room for a more premium credit card than the, I guess, 2 consumer cards that you offer through Chase right now. I'm just wondering, like mechanically, how does that work? Are you guys free to potentially offer a third card if you choose to or does that require reopening the contract, stuff like that? Just wondering about those mechanics and whether there's maybe a loyalty benefit on top of the cabin stuff that you've already announced. Bob Jordan : Well, I'll let Ryan take the details. But I think what we said at the Investor Day was that there is a lot of opportunity inside everything we announced, things like the seating changes, the airline partnerships, getaways, all that to further monetize the card, the relationship with Chase, and there's just work to do there. And generally, what could be a tailwind there with continuing to monetize the Chase relationship was not included in the numbers that we gave you at Investor Day. So it's on top of that. There's work to do there. But just the mechanics of how you get there, obviously, it's a negotiation. I'll let Ryan talk about that. Ryan Green : Yes, Jamie. We can't do -- we could not just create a card on our own absent Chase. They have to underwrite it. We have to come to agreement on what the associated benefits with the new card product is and what the economics around that is. But we do those things from time to time. And we have to -- there are boarding benefits associated with our cards today that will no longer be relevant in an assigned seating and premium seating world. And so discussions with Chase on just how we're going to evolve the product structure to account for an assigned seating and premium seating world are currently underway. It doesn't take a reopening of the entire contract. We can make amendments to the contract, but yes, that's a conversation between us and Chase. Operator : The next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities. Dan McKenzie : Bob, I know it's really early and I know your focus is the current plan. But when you were interviewing the Board additions, I'm curious if the new members have begun to affect your thought process initially. And if there were any ideas shared that you're contemplating and I guess how the current strategic initiatives are being received? Bob Jordan : Dan, I may give you a little broader answer just kind of clarify all this. The Board has been undergoing a lot of refresh that was going on before Elliott and then obviously, that's accelerated. And we announced the 6 off and then with Gary, 7. And then we've been looking to fill those, and we filled 1 of those through Southwest with Pierre and then the 5 from Elliott. And just to make sure you know that I had a chance to interview their slate, and I've talked to each of those folks extensively about their views of Southwest, what they bring to the Board, what they bring to Southwest Airlines. And I could tell you that they're all committed to serving Southwest and looking forward to be part of our Board and serving our shareholders. Obviously, we've added a number of airline experts, both through Southwest and then with what was announced last night. So we've added Rakesh. We've added Bob Fornaro and now, Gregg Saretsky and David Cush, and they all bring a wealth of airline experience and what I like is that they bring a variety of experience. And so you've got folks that have started airlines, have worked, obviously, at ULCCs, low-cost, something closer to a legacy and so -- and have had a lot of different types of service. Not arguing that we're going to do any of those things at Southwest Airlines but they will certainly help stretch our thinking. Obviously, there will be another plan after this plan. We're always evolving. And so their input will be welcome and I think constructive in terms of how we think about Southwest 5 and 10 and 15 years from now. At the same time, I can assure you they all have genuine respect for Southwest, our history, our culture and are all looking forward to working together. Dan McKenzie : Yes. Congrats on putting that behind you. And Tammy, thanks for the comment around the fleet monetization strategy, and apologies for going back to this again. But is the primary driver of the benefit just really a function of reduced depreciation and maintenance expense? And just wondering if there's a labor component in there. Or high level, I guess, pardon me, I'm just curious what the big drivers are to that estimate of that range. Tammy Romo : Yes. The big driver, of course, would be the gain that we would report. Again, we have very attractive pricing on our aircraft and on our existing fleet, of course, that would be reflected in the net book value. So the primary driver there would be the gains on the monetization of that strategy, particularly for the potential aircraft sales. Operator : The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : On the $1 billion EBIT build you called out for '25, I believe most of that's revenue, but could you just talk about what percentage is already enacted? You show an ongoing network optimization and I know you're doing marketing now and revenue management. But if you could just like talk about where we're at in terms of percentages of that already in the network today. Andrew Watterson : Is that the network changes or the overall revenue progression? I'm sorry. Conor Cunningham : Yes, so you have $1 billion of EBIT coming from network optimization, marketing and so on. What is already in the market today? I know you made a lot of adjustments to your network in general, and you're doing marketing and so on. But if you could just level set on what's already been put out there. Bob Jordan : Conor, I'll just start and then Andrew can come behind with details. Obviously, you've got 3 things. You've got the revenue management changes that were enacted primarily to take effect in August. You had network changes that are ongoing. There is another set that comes into play next year with things like Atlanta. And then you've got the distribution and marketing efforts and changes, things like Skyscanner that just went active. And the ones that are in place today, primarily revenue management are the contributor to why we're seeing the acceleration in the unit revenue trends across the third quarter and that so far is continuing into the fourth quarter. So you take all that together, what is in place so far, which is again some network, primarily revenue management, we're on track for what we need to see in terms of improvement to hit that $1 billion in 2025. That's a little different than your question. I can't quantify, but the main point is that we're on track in terms of a build to hit that $1 billion in 2025. Andrew Watterson : You're right, Bob. I don't think we've decomposed. Bob Jordan : We have not. Andrew Watterson : How much and when and stuff like that, but as far as the actions that lead to that value, the network, as I've mentioned earlier, will be published next week through the summer. So what you'll see then will be a reflection of the network changes largely in place then. Then you have the revenue management and marketing activities, which you have the first couple of waves of those are already being -- have already been implemented and you're seeing them ramp up in their benefits. There are further actions to come in both revenue management pricing and the marketing distribution for us to drive further value to get to that tactical initiatives business case that you'll see reflect in 2025. So I would say that a lot of the actions are done and underway in the market, but the value would ramp up as we progress through next year. Conor Cunningham : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe back to just the headcount question that Scott was talking about. I know you're offering paid time-off to some employees and you're working through headcount in general through natural attrition. Has there been any internal debate, though, around being more aggressive with whether it's early retirements or so on? The reason why I ask, you're buying back stock, you feel comfortable with the outlook. Has there been more of a focus on trying to get heads out that aren't necessarily as productive as they're going to be, given your expectations around capacity growth? Bob Jordan : Conor, thank you. Just too level set on where we are and sorry, this is redundant. Our commitment was to be down 2,000 headcount this year compared to last year even on modest growth, and we're on track to do that. We have another -- it's kind of invisible. We have another close to 2,000 that are effectively out through the short-term lead programs a day, a week, a month kind of thing. So they show up as an FTE but there's no cost because they're effectively on a short-term leave or basically just time-off without pay. And then we're committed to being down again next year. Now your question is, are we willing to go further? And as we -- as part of the cost project, in addition to sort of your typical supply chain efforts, tech ops, parts, all the kinds of things that you know, efficiencies, we'll be working hard on overhead. And as we work our way through that, which we are just now starting, I'm not predicting anything but we've done it before. Maybe that we do offer tools around things like early out. We just need to foresee the numbers, understand where we are and then look at what tools it takes to hit the target. So we'll have a lot more for you as we progress our way through the cost initiative. But just to start with, we are committed to hitting the cost we've committed to being more efficient across the company through overhead, corporate overhead, and we use the techniques that we need to get there. Andrew Watterson : I think, Bob, sometimes people do FTEs, time to salary equals a cost, which is appropriate for a white collar workforce. But for an hourly workforce, it misses the fact that there's hours in there. So if you were to look at the ground ops, in public data, you'd say FTEs per trip of about 22% versus pre pandemic because the hours we paid is up 14%. So you see a big gap between the hours we're paying out and the headcount. Now that residual 14% is still something we need to work on, but you can take roughly half of that and say that is staffing we did -- we needed pre pandemic that we didn't have and we saw [indiscernible] Elliott, we needed to have that. So that is in there. And then the portion of that, which is like many in the airline industry as the economy in general, were less productive or efficient than we used to be. So the work we have going forward, whether it's the turn, red-eyes, standards that we're putting in place, lots of other tools, we're going to work down that kind of inefficiency that's come in post pandemic, and then also work back that extra headcount, the needs of extra headcount that we saw that we needed because of the winter ops demand. And so the overstaffing portion has been mitigated by the reduced hours I illustrated earlier, but the remaining hours are needed to the operation we have, yet there's still a need to get more efficient. And so we need to get more efficient is the next step in our journey, not necessarily less people since we've got the hours down with regard to this particular work group. And many of the work groups has a similar dynamic. The one work group that does not have that dynamic is our pilots, as we've discussed previously. However, and so this year, we are paying minimums, meaning there's times when we don't need as many pilots we have, not every month but a number of the months this year. When we add red-eyes next year, that will then start to eat into that period where we are paying minimums because there will be incremental flying for which we don't need incremental pilots. So it's a journey but you can't just do the FTEs time-salary math to look at potential savings. You have to really work through the hours since this is an hourly workforce. It's set for the overhead, which Bob mentioned. Tammy Romo : And just one final just note that might be helpful, just on the what's embedded in terms of the net overstaffing impact. As I shared, I believe at Investor Day, we expect that to be roughly $120 million this year. And as Andrew took you through, the impact is primarily coming from our pilot work group. And just to demonstrate how we're continuing to work that down for the fourth quarter, that impact is expected to be less than $20 million, again with that impact coming primarily from the pilots. So we're working it down and we're very focused on our cost initiative next year to continue to rein in the impact from overstaffing. Operator : The next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Bob, just keep it to 1 question, 3 parts here, though, and it's really about capacity. I want to take it back to your opening remarks when you talked about tactics and strategy. So as we think about the network for '25, could you speak to the composition, so stage, gate departures? And then also, where you see the opportunities, where you're focusing on, I guess? And within those markets, is that going to be more about frequencies and connectivity? And then part B so the 1% to 2% guide for next year, it's not a wide range at a point, but all the moving pieces particularly as they relate to the revenue side. Why isn't 1% a better way to think about this, again, all things considered with the plan out there and how dynamic the marketplace is? Bob Jordan : You bet. And this capacity and what that kind of decomposing that generally maybe a couple of things. I'm sorry to be redundant. The capacity that is being created is being created through initiatives. Just making sure that, that's clear. It's coming from red-eyes and the turn, compression that creates a significant amount of aircraft without having to apply aircraft CapEx. So the modest capacity that we do have is being created without spending money to buy those aircraft. On the decomposition of the network, and Andrew can add a lot more here, we're basically holding capacity from areas that make -- that may be struggling a bit. You saw the changes we announced to Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, we've closed a few cities and then being generally redeployed in points of strength like the Nashvilles and Austins, those kinds of things. And it's a little bit of everything. Sometimes it's a new route, sometimes it's frequency on a route. Andrew, I think generally, the stage is continuing to rise just generally, maybe a little rule of thumb, especially with business travel continuing to not be all the way back and put some pressure on short haul. But the thing we're going to do is we're going to continue to apply capacity and points of strength and where we see the demand. On the narrow range between the 1% and the 2%, yes, that's really, really tight. I'm not sure I understand the question on why 1% versus 2%, but it's really a modest amount. And that already creates obviously unit cost pressure to be growing at that small over rate, and anything below that exacerbates that. But we're just committed to a lower capacity number until we earn our cost of capital, exceed our cost of capital and hit the targets that we've talked to you about. Now the wildcard, obviously, for '25 is what about Boeing? I'm proud of our folks. They planned really effectively for '24. We planned for a strike. We created our own number of 20 deliveries, and it's going to come in right on top of that. And '25, if the strike goes much longer, there will be an impact. We have a lot of flexibility in the fleet. We'll have to deal with that and adapt. But if the strike goes a long time, it's going to make it hard. I'll just admit it's going to make it hard to hit those -- the higher end certainly of that capacity number because you're just not getting the deliveries. So a lot of this is really up in the air until we know more about Boeing, when the strike ends, when they get back online and when they hit their rate. So I just would say that '25, we just owe you an answer there as we know more about Boeing. And then just on the decomposition, Andrew? Andrew Watterson : Yes, we already see this year that our stage reflected outward was pushing mid-single digits. And as we go into next year, you can see what's already published that our trips are going to be down year-over-year, but our actual gains of our aircraft is up about 1% in those months already published, and you start to get to lower single-digits for stage increase. So the stage engaged will drive ASMs and reduce frequency. So you can infer by that, these are going to be not short-haul business markets necessarily but a kind of mixed business/leisure and that more medium -- what we call medium-haul distance, which is around about 1,000 miles on average is what expect to see for all the new stuff. Julia Landrum : Okay. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and hope you all have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin taking your questions, Gary, can you please share instructions on how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Probably a question for Ryan. The Getaway product, have you decided yet if you'll work -- if you're going to only sell direct or will you also be selling through travel agencies? And the second part of that question is you all noted, Steve as a partner. You said there were 2 others. Are you able to say what the other 2 are? Ryan Green : Sure, yes. Getaways, as you know, we'll launch mid-next year. And today, we announced partnerships, 3 direct lodging partnerships. Caesars Entertainment in Las Vegas, and then Sandos and Playa in Cancun and in the Caribbean are the 3 direct lodging partners. We also -- we have access to hotel inventory outside of direct lodging partners as well. We announced our bed bank partner today, hotel beds as well. And there are a couple of other announcements out there on some technology that we're using to put the packages together. So a lot of announcements today. We're making really good progress towards our launch mid-next year. As it relates to how we're going to go to market there, primarily it will be direct from our website. We have the largest airline website in the United States where we have -- we carry a lot of customers to these large leisure markets that have the highest share of packages. So we've already got -- we already have customers on our website that we can monetize these packages to. Does that mean that we won't sell through travel agents at all? The answer there is no, but the primary source of that will be our own direct distribution. Robert Silk : Okay. So you may still work through -- you are still going to have -- is it going to be select agencies or will there be a general reach-out to agencies? Ryan Green : Yes, we're working through our go-to-market plans on that so there's nothing to share specifically on that today. But I think you should just think about it generally as primarily a direct distribution on our own -- through our own channels. Operator : The next question is from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Rajesh Singh : I have 2 questions, 1 on Boeing. Second on Elliott, but when does Boeing strike start impacting your growth plans? Bob Jordan : Well, Boeing, I think we just don't know. I mean, we're already -- like we talked about, we were expecting near 80 aircraft this year. We're going to take 20 so we're far off of our plan. We will no doubt be far off of our contractual plan next year. The fact that we've lowered our capacity appetite to 1% to 2% is certainly helpful. If we've been at something higher, we'd be having much more difficult issue. We do have a lot of flexibility in our fleet plan because of that because we just need a smaller number of aircraft to fulfill the growth, and the growth is coming through initiatives anyways. But at the end of the day, we need a good Boeing and a strong Boeing. We need a Boeing that is on track in terms of its rate and on track in terms of its delivering its aircraft to Southwest Airlines. So we can tolerate a bit of an interruption here with the strike because we planned for it. But if the strike goes much further, obviously, we'll have to decide how we adjust our fleet next year or adjust our appetite in our schedule. So a lot more to come there, obviously, in terms of Boeing clearing up what's happening. And then second, once we know that, we can deal with what we can do to mitigate the impact. But no, it's an issue for sure. Rajesh Singh : And on Elliott, congrats for getting the deal done. But there is a view that the deal has come at a very high price. They have got five board seats. Some people are calling it more of a truce than a peace deal. Do you foresee it being disruptive going forward for your turndown strategy? Bob Jordan : Well, first, the -- I'd just remind you that we have been -- the Board has been in an ongoing long-planned refreshment period here. We've added a lot of new members. We had already announced that we would have 6 step off and then Gary, so that's 7, and we did accelerate that to November 1 as part of the agreement, but we had announced 7 were coming off. And we had plans to, if we couldn't get an agreement with Elliott, continue to march through filling those seats, which is what you saw with us adding Pierre. So it's basically 7 off, 6 on with Pierre so the Board is still shrinking. I think the main thing is that it is a portion of the Board is not control. It's not control of the company, not control of the Board at the subset. And then really, our focus has been on interviewing these folks and understanding what they bring to the Board, who they are, what their personalities are like, how well they'll get along with our current Board members and assimilate. Because at the end of the day, you want great Board members to support Southwest Airlines and our shareholders and our plans. And again, I had a chance to interview their 5 that we took, and I think we've got some great Board members here. They bring a wealth of experience and they'll be additive to our Board. So whether they came from Elliott or another route, we're just looking for good board members. If you just go down the list, again, Gregg Saretsky, a lot of airline experience, WestJet, Alaska. Cush, experience with Virgin America and others; Sarah Feinberg, governmental affairs, FAA background; President of Marriott, a lot of retail; Patty Watson, a CIO at NCR, brings a lot of technology experience which we can use. And then Pierre Breber, who we have sourced ourselves, a retired CFO with Chevron, brings both the financial background and brings an oil and gas background. So all of those folks, I think, will serve our Board, bring expertise and serve our shareholders well. Operator : The next question is from Leslie Joseph with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Just curious on the MAX 7, knowing what we know now, when do you reasonably expect that to fly for Southwest? And then secondly, this is a little existential but Boeing is looking at what it would look like in 5 years, slimming down and all its changes. How do you -- you're making a lot of changes at Southwest. How do you see the airline in 5 years' time and 10 years' time? And do you think it will look a lot more like some of the legacy carriers? And how do you expect to stand out? Andrew Watterson : I'll take the first 1 and give Bob the second one. Obviously, the MAX 7, we still expect it to be certified sometime in the middle of next year. The engine is issue which is a pacing item. It's undergoing tests now. And the change, we have -- our engineers have confidence in the technical changes that are proposed. The FAA will ultimately decide if it's sufficient. And once that is sufficient, then they have to then finish the rest of the certification activities, which to us look almost all but done. And then after that, we'll need at least a 6-month lag between that and us putting it in revenue service because obviously, we have to then bring it into certificate, get our manuals updated and approved by the FAA and such. And you obviously can't rush those type of things. So therefore, our plan for next year does not include the MAX 7. But our plan for the following year could, given that the Boeing's delivery [indiscernible] over the last few years, we don't lock down that plan with regards to their type of gauge they deliver to us at this point in time. But as we get closer and we do see the certification, we began in earnest for the details in our 2026 plan, we would then perhaps integrate that into our flying schedule. Bob Jordan : And Leslie, just on the -- maybe the longer-term Boeing, longer -- much longer-term Southwest Airlines, I'll tell you we've got a great order book in place with Boeing that goes through 2031, access to a lot of aircraft at very attractive pricing. So we've got really good protection there kind of no matter what we want to do with that. We've talked a lot about monetizing the opportunity to monetize the fleet but we have access. Again, the main thing is we have access to a lot of aircraft and terrific pricing. And we need Boeing to fix the issues and deliver those aircraft. As you think about further than that, maybe that's where you're going. Number one for Southwest Airlines, we're focused on delivering the transformational plan that we just laid out a few weeks ago, assigned seating and extra legroom and partnerships and Getaways by Southwest and so much more. And our focus is delivering all those initiatives and hitting the targets that we laid out. As any company, you're always -- there's always a strategy mode out there. You're always thinking about what about 5 years from now? What about 10 years from now? And we're just not ready to talk about any of that. One thing you know for sure is the Southwest that you see in 10 years won't look like the Southwest that you see today because you're always evolving. And that could include all kinds of things. But just -- yes, I'd just be speculating. The main thing is we've got a great order book with Boeing. It takes us well into the future to 2031 and we're fully focused on executing the plan that's in front of us. Leslie Josephs : Okay. And then you mentioned earlier, Bob, that if the strike goes on much longer, you're going to have to revisit the fleet plan. What is much longer? Is it through the end of the year? Is it a couple more weeks? What is that cut-off? Bob Jordan : It's probably an inexact answer. We planned for a strike roughly, I think, Andrew, in the 5-ish weeks kind of range, kind of where we are because I believe historically, that's been a typical strike for Boeing. So we planned for that. And the amount of adjustment, it obviously fluctuates a lot based on how long this goes. So as -- so it's just really hard to speculate. If the strike goes a lot further, again, we'll look at our fleet opportunities in terms of what we can do and maintain capacity sets at some point it becomes difficult to do that and you think about having to adjust schedules that are way out in the future. We don't want to do that because it's disruptive to our customers. So it's all total speculation at this point. And what I'm most proud of is that our folks planned for the strike and they planned appropriately. We're getting exactly the number of aircraft this year that we planned on. And you got to control what you can control, and we planned on a moderated number in '25 as well kind of compared to what the original expectation was. I think we just have to see where we are. Again, we have options to manage this within our fleet. But at some point, you'd have to moderate the capacity and schedules. We're just not there yet. Andrew Watterson : And it's less about the duration per se than the ramp-up afterwards. The longer it goes on, the more it could trickle back in the supply chain and cause delays there. So any manufacturing process of airlines, aircraft or whatever, if you shut down -- the longer you shut down, the longer it takes to ramp back up and it's not often one-for-one. So it's really understanding how long that ramp-up will be. It will be the pace that we can speculate now and plan for it, but ultimately, Boeing will have to master that and communicate with their customers. Bob Jordan : Yes. You've seen Boeing has furloughs or plans and then now the suppliers have furloughs, and all that has to be restarted once they have a contract in place. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session for media, so back over to Whitney now for some closing thoughts. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, everyone. If you have any further questions, our communications group is standing by. Their contact information, along with today's news release are all available at swamedia.com. Operator : The conference has concluded. Thank you all for attending. We'll meet again here next quarter. You may now disconnect.",

A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's remarks, there's an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia. Julia Landrum : Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airlines' fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our President and CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; Executive Vice President and Chief Transformation Officer, Ryan Green; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Bob will start off by providing a high level update on the and full year 2024 performance as well as a strategic update on our Southwest Even Better plan. He will then turn it over to Andrew to discuss our revenue momentum and our industry leading operational performance. Ryan will provide a progress update on our portfolio of strategic initiatives, highlighting key milestones achieved. Tammy will follow to walk through cost performance and outlook. She will also discuss our fleet strategy and cover balance sheet and capital allocation. Bob will wrap us up with a few comments, after which we will move to Q&A. As a reminder, we will make forward-looking statements which are based on current expectations of future performance. Our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference non-GAAP results which exclude special items and are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings press release. Our press release with fourth quarter 2024 results and a supplemental presentation that includes our updated initiative scorecard were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Julia. And before we jump into our results, I want to take a moment upfront to acknowledge tragic accident near Reagan DCA Airport last night. Our hearts go out to all those loved ones who are among the passengers and the crew and we also extend our sympathies to our friends at American Airlines and their subsidiary PSA Airlines as they process this event themselves. Finally, I want to thank the first responders who worked tirelessly throughout the night. And while we are all competitors, we are one airline community and we will do everything that we can to support our friends at American and at PSA. Now turning to the business. 2024 was a foundational year for us. We further invested in the operation, we finalized our open labor contracts, and we laid-out a comprehensive plan, our Southwest Even Better plan. The plan, which is the most transformational in the history of the company, includes initiatives to boost our efficiency and lower costs, including the ability to fly redeye to turn our aircraft our faster. And also significantly improves our customer experience and expand what we offer customer by reducing things like partnerships and all new vacations product, all of which enhance the rapid rewards in the cobrand ecosystem. Ultimately, the plan provides a path to financial prosperity, which we believe will open exciting growth opportunities ahead. We are already seeing the benefits of the work we did last year and the plan is well underway. I am very pleased with the momentum we are carrying into 2025 as a result of that effort. Starting with the operation, we saw improvements in nearly every key metric demonstrating success from our multiyear investments. In fact, we finished the year with an industry leading completion factor and just last week, we were recognized by The Wall Street Journal as one of the top two U.S. carriers who have, and I quote, separated themselves from the pack. We finished with a mere one point gap to first place, a gap that we will work very hard to overcome in 2025. We also finished the year with strong year-over-year unit revenue improvement. Unit revenues for the fourth quarter came in 8% higher than fourth quarter 2023, well above the improved expectations we provided in early December. Nominally, fourth quarter RASM was also 7% higher sequentially relative to third quarter RASM and that is 5 points ahead of the historical third quarter to fourth quarter trend. The very hard work of our teams helped drive this acceleration as they executed tactical improvements. In addition to improvement from tactical actions, we experienced benefits from a constructive industry backdrop, driven by continued demand strength and capacity moderation. We're making great progress with our strategic initiative portfolio, our fleet monetization strategy and our capital allocation plan. The team will walk through the details to provide you with execution proof points and share how we are hitting key milestones. While I see improvement in our pace of execution, the focus on driving speed and agility will continue. And while we are focused on execution, we will keep a pulse on trends and be open minded as we consider ways to continually improve the business. Moving to our cost performance, we are experiencing above normal unit cost inflation, most notably in market driven wage rates, airport costs, and healthcare. We outlined a multiyear $500 million cost plan back at Investor Day to help mitigate cost inflation and become more efficient, and we will be relentless in pursuing cost takeout. While we haven't yet shared the cadence of how the $500 million comes online, the focus will be on achieving that rate as quickly as possible. We are committed to the efficiency work, including corporate overhead. The fact is corporate overhead has grown at a faster rate than the rest of the airline as we staffed up for initiatives. We must be the leader in terms of efficiency, and you'll see us being aggressive as we work to become a leaner and more agile organization. Our imperative in 2025 is to deliver improved financial results and build further momentum to hit the milestones required to deliver on our 2026 and 2027 Investor Day targets. And we're committed to transparency and routine updates. We debuted a scorecard last quarter and we updated it again this morning detailing our progress and it's available on our Investor Relations website. For the core business initiatives, we continue to deliver to expect to deliver at or exceed the $1 billion 2025 EBIT contribution target, which excludes any benefit from fleet transactions. Now moving to the fleet, there is a lot going on at Boeing. I was just there last week visiting with the leadership team and walking the factory floor. They have clearly been hard at work, and I was pleased with the progress that I saw. Everyone was engaged and focused. And while they still have much work to do, they appear to be on a good path and we're feeling more optimistic. Regardless, we think it's prudent to hedge our bets. We are now planning with a conservative 38 delivery assumption for 2025 to de-risk the operation. We conservatively adjusted our plans back in March of 2024 and we've not had to republish the schedule since. So, we are doing the same thing this year. That's very different from our contractual number, which for 2025 is now 136. We aren't going to get 136 aircraft, but we believe Boeing is on pace to exceed 38 this year and over the next couple of years, that there will be an opportunity to do plenty of transactions as Boeing ramps up their production. Tammy is going to go into a lot more detail, but my point is that the opportunity is large. And despite the question of fleet timing, we still aim to deliver the $1.5 billion of targeted total 2025 incremental EBIT from our Investor Day initiative portfolio. We're seeing our tactical actions yield benefits faster than planned and expect to hit all key milestones for our strategic initiatives. As a wrap up, we're in a great position to capitalize on our momentum and continue making progress towards our goals. We have a comprehensive plan, a detailed set of initiatives, a constructive industry backdrop, and we are executing with urgency and purpose. We will not let up for even a moment as we move forward and deliver the Southwest even better plan. I want to thank our employees for their dedication and commitment for the excellent operation they've been running despite a wave of winter weather. It's just truly exceptional. And I will now turn it over to Andrew to cover the operations and tactical initiative performance in more detail. Andrew? Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Bob. I want to start by thanking our frontline employees for all their hard work and for helping Southwest have an outstanding year operationally. As Bob mentioned, last week we were recognized in The Wall Street Journal's 2024 annual airline rankings moving up to a very close second place this year taking into consideration seven key metrics. Among the nine major U.S. Airlines, we were the leader in completion factor with less than 1% of flights canceled during the year. We also had the lowest rate of tarmac delays and the fewest DOT customer submissions, and we didn't come in below fourth in any category, which is a testament to both our people and investments in the operation. Turning to our revenue performance, we are pleased with how we finished 2024. Our fourth quarter RASM was up 8% year-over-year, which exceeded our prior guidance range of up 5.5% to 7%. In fact, we saw a nice trend in year-over-year RASM growth as we closed out 2024 as we realized tailwinds both from our internal initiatives and capacity adjustments as well as the benefits of a healthy industry backdrop. While there was noteworthy pressure from supply demand imbalance in the first half of 2024, we saw a pivot to capacity moderation across the industry with continued healthy demand in the latter part of the year. And as you know, we took deliberate steps to recalibrate and better optimize our revenue management systems and processes. The benefit of that work is materializing faster than expected. As we shared at Investor Day, the revenue management initiative is comprehensive and is supported by a range of capabilities and advancement activities. For example, we reorganized the revenue management team to manage demand for customer itineraries rather than managing demand for individual flights. This change aligns our teams more closely to our system. On the tool side, we invested improving our ability to predict demand patterns both by booking window and by flight. We have also launched new proprietary dashboards to help our team to better optimize the revenue performance of our highest demand seats. We are seeing yield benefits from our RM advancement efforts across the board. Those flights with greater 90% load factor are seeing the strongest close in performance as a result of better management of the booking curve. And our flights with less than 90% load factor also seeing sequential improvements as we better optimize fares further out in the booking curve. As we look into 2025, we will keep the same intensity and focus on delivering value from our tactical initiatives. We while also remaining committed to closely managing capacity. We have made a lot of progress improving yield in fourth quarter and our focus now is on maintaining yield performance as we work to close the load factor gap. We expect current demand strength to continue in 2025 and our first quarter RASM is projected to be up in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. As the year progresses, we expect positive year-over-year RASM growth driven by tactical initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect to see benefits from the next phase of our network realignment. This includes reductions to Atlanta and Oakland that were previously discussed with that capacity being redeployed to point to strength like Nashville and Sacramento. We also expect to see revenue contribution from partnerships, Getaways and loyalty initiatives, most notably in the fourth quarter. So while we are pleased with our progress, we are far from satisfied. We have a plan and we will be urgent and delivered in our execution. As I close, I want to thank our people for running a great operation and delivering unparalleled Southwest Hospitality. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan to go over the progress of our strategic initiatives. Ryan Greene : Thanks, Andrew. As Bob mentioned, I am going to provide you with updates on our strategic initiatives as we continue to execute against our Southwest Even Better plan. Earlier this month, we signed our first commercial agreement with Icelandair, making them our first partner carrier. And starting February 13, we will begin connecting customers and bags crossing the Atlantic on Iceland Air into the Southwest network at our Baltimore station. This is an important milestone in our plan to expand how and where our customers can travel. We will continue to evolve this partnership and plan to also connect Icelandair into our network in Denver and Nashville later this year which provides even more connection opportunities through shared gateways. Also, earlier this month we received our ISO certification for successfully completing the IATA operational safety audit. This serves as the industry benchmark in safety auditing and we are proud of this achievement that reaffirms our commitment to the highest safety standards. It's also an important milestone in our transformation journey as it sets the stage for future growth through additional airline partnerships. We continue to pursue partnership agreements with other global carriers and still plan to announce at least one additional partner carrier later this year. Our Getaways by Southwest product is also expected to launch later this year and we are excited to announce today that we will add MGM Resorts International to our list of partners in Las Vegas. This represents a large milestone from one of our focus markets for Getaways by Southwest and along with our existing partners there, this will give us access to a substantial portion of the hotel inventory in Las Vegas with more partners to come. We continue to make progress and move forward on our assigned and premium seating product and continue to expect to meet the financial targets and timelines we communicated at Investor Day to begin selling seat assignments in the second half of this year and operate flights with assigned and premium seating in the first half of next year. As we finalize our cabin layout and work towards FAA certification, we plan to begin retrofitting aircraft midyear starting with our larger -800 aircraft with the smaller 700 to follow later in the year. By beginning retrofits midyear, it allows us to meet our planned operate date. It minimizes the amount of time we have a mixed fleet and it keeps the 700 aircraft flying with their current seat count for more of this year. We believe our tech ops facilities, employees and vendors are well equipped to update our entire fleet within our timeline. Technology development is also going well. Our technology employees and vendors are hard at work coding the necessary technological changes and will soon begin a rigorous testing phase before we begin selling assigned seats. Another key milestone reached just this month is our amended co brand agreement with Chase. As we've discussed before, we needed to update our agreement to provide our card members with new benefits related to our assigned and premium seating products. We'll have more information to share on the details of those benefits soon, but we're excited to get these new card products into the market as we're confident customers will value these benefits and they will drive Co Brand card acquisitions in the future. This agreement supports the multiyear financial targets we announced at Investor Day. Within the operation, we continue to focus on efficiency and modernization by reducing the time it takes to turn an aircraft and increasing our aircraft productivity. We've made meaningful progress toward our goal of removing paper based processes from the day to day operation and have digitized crew paperwork. Our November 2024 schedule was the first that implemented a five minute reduction in turn times in 12 of our stations, and I'm happy to report that it's working as planned with no operational impact. Later this quarter, we plan to introduce a digital communication tool that will allow pilots, flight attendants and operations agents to chat live with each other while they're working to turn the aircraft between flights, further enhancing our efficiency. We continue to expect our turn time initiative to create the equivalent of roughly 16 free aircraft by the end of November this year. While we are already a leader in turn time, we are confident this will further our competitive advantage in the day-to-day operation. In addition to reducing turn time, we will also launch redeye flying in 5 key markets next month with the first flights arriving on Valentine's Day. This will ramp up to a total of 33 redeye markets in the June 2025 base schedule including Huawei routes. And we're pleased with how redeye flights are booking today with nearly 75% of passengers on a connecting itinerary either before or after the redeye flight. Redeye flights capitalize on peak seasonality and maximize network connectivity, while generating incremental load factor. And remember that, our turn and redeye initiatives aid our modest capacity growth plans for this year above 1% to 2% year-over-year. And finally, I am pleased to share that our service modernization efforts to drive operational efficiencies and improved experience for employees and customers are also paying off. As a result of the digital capabilities we provided our customers to enable them to self-serve, we've seen call volumes decrease even further than what was assumed in our plans. These digital enhancements have enabled a significant increase in efficiency within our call center. As you can see, we are working hard and making continued progress on our transformational plan. We are committed to continued execution and delivering on our Southwest Even Better plan. And I want to thank the hard work of our incredible people who are making this happen. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Tammy Romo : Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I am pleased by the level of execution Ryan just covered and the realization of early benefits from our Southwest Even Better plan. As we laid out, our plan provides a roadmap to transform Southwest and importantly to restore our financial prosperity and drive sustainable shareholder value. While we have more hard work ahead to hit our multi-year financial targets, our fourth quarter performance exceeded expectations and we ended the year with improved year-over-year margins in the fourth quarter. Much of this improvement has already been covered, so I'll pick up with color on our cost performance and we'll close with a few comments on the balance sheet and an update on capital allocation including more insights on our fleet monetization strategy. Our fourth quarter 2024 CASM-X increased 11.1% year over year and full year 2024 CASM-X increased 7.8% year-over-year, both inclusive of a $92 million gain from a sale leaseback transaction in fourth quarter 2024. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of elevated operating expenses associated with inflationary pressures including contractual market driven wage rate increases. And fourth quarter specifically, the decline in capacity growth resulted in additional unit cost pressure. We are urgently working towards implementing the $500 million cost initiative announced at Investor Day in September with an intense focus on exceeding that number and accelerating as much of the benefit into this year as possible. Our efforts are focused on mitigating cost inflation by minimizing hiring, optimizing scheduling efficiency, capitalizing on supply chain opportunities and aggressively improving corporate overhead. Looking forward, we currently expect this quarter's CASM-X to increase in the range of 7% to 9% year-over-year driven primarily by the continuation of general inflationary pressures from wage and work rule headwinds from labor contracts ratified last year and also from continued capacity moderation efforts. As 2025 progresses, our year-over-year unit cost inflation is expected to ease as we lap labor contract anniversaries, deploy initiative-driven capacity growth and aggressively pursue benefits from our cost initiative. Our cabin retrofit efforts associated with our premium seating initiatives are expected to result in approximately $150 million in incremental costs, primarily in the second half of the year. But these will be one time and will not carry forward into 2026. Taking all these variables into account excluding potential gains from any future sale, fleet sale, sale leaseback transactions, we expect to exit 2025 with fourth quarter year over year CASM-X growth in the low-single-digit. Moving to fleet, as we highlighted in third quarter earnings, we saw the prudent planning of our conservative fleet delivery expectations pay off. As a reminder, we entered 2024 expecting to receive 79 Boeing aircraft deliveries. In March, Boeing informed us we would receive 46. After going through a detailed process, we conservatively adjusted our plan to 20 deliveries to reduce the risk of further operational impact. We closed out 2024 with a total of 22 deliveries essentially in line with our internal estimation. Now in terms of how we are thinking about managing our fleet this year, we have a modest capacity plan of 1% to 2% year-over-year growth and that growth is fully funded by our efficiency initiatives. This sets us up to reduce our total aircraft count by year end. However, we still want as many deliveries as possible to modernize our fleet and reach our goal of an all -7, -8 fleet in 2031. To that end, we are planning to retire 51 aircraft this year and in addition we are contemplating the sale of an additional 10 -800NGs. To support this, we need 38 deliveries from Boeing. However, as Bob shared, all incremental deliveries beyond 38 offer an opportunity to accelerate the execution of our fleet monetization strategy. I will remind you that we view our fleet monetization strategy as incremental to the base business improvement. This strategy is highly idiosyncratic opportunity to monetize our fleet through a portfolio of sales and sale leaseback to fund fleet monetization and support shareholder return. The fleet opportunity is uniquely available to Southwest as a result of the following factors. One, current industry aircraft supply constraints, which are driven by OEM challenges creating strong demand in the secondary market. Two, the embedded value in our -8 from Boeing compensation and favorable pricing, which create the meaningful value gap relative to the strong secondary market. And three, access to aircraft provided by contractual order book which is beyond the need of our modest capacity plans. As a reminder, the 1% to 2% growth over the next three years does not require additional aircraft as it is funded by efficiency initiatives. Now of course the -800 and -8 aircraft play different roles in our fleet strategy initiative. I'll start with the -800. These are midlife aircraft that currently have highly favorable market valuations. The current market setup and our order book economics combined to create an opportunity to replace these midlife -800 with new -8. This creates value for Southwest and we plan to realize the lower maintenance and fuel costs, enhanced customer experience and better reliability associated with -8 aircraft, all with reduced capital spending. With the -8 aircraft, the opportunity to realize value comes from the ability to sell excess aircraft in our order book and pull forward the significant embedded value that comes from favorable pricing and the current market value. However, to be able to fully execute this strategy we must receive sufficient deliveries from Boeing. While we are feeling very good about where Boeing is headed, we will want to gain confidence in their production capabilities, before we move forward with sales. So you can understand that, our strong preference is to execute sales. The -800 sales facilitate capital efficient fleet modernization and for the -8 the opportunity is to harvest significant embedded value. We will however be opportunistic with sale leasebacks and pursue them as a mechanism for an orderly exit of the -800s from our fleet. Now that we have completed our first transaction, you have a better idea of the economics of the -800 sale leaseback. Sale leaseback allow us to lock-in the certainty of today's strong secondary pricing while simultaneously bridging our operation, until we are confident that we will receive our contractual replacement -7s and -8s from Boeing. Essentially these sale leasebacks are functioning as forward sales and again we will pursue them opportunistically only where it makes financial sense, while also taking to account overall fleet modernization goals, financing needs and capital allocation considerations. Moving to CapEx. Full year 2024 gross capital expenditures were $2.1 billion in line with previous guidance. Including proceeds of $871 million from the sale lease back transaction in fourth quarter 2024, full year 2024 net capital expenditures were $1.2 billion. We currently expect 2025 gross capital spending to be in a range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This includes approximately $1.2 billion in aircraft capital spending and $1.6 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Again, there is an opportunity to lower net capital spending from our fleet monetization strategy. As we look to the future, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and are proud to have an investment grade rating by all three rating agencies. We also remain committed to providing significant returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2024, we returned $680 million consisting of $430 million in dividends and $250 million of share repurchases to our shareholders. The $250 million ASR was the first repurchase program of the $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization announced at our September Investor Day. The company continues to plan for the launch of an additional $750 million ASR program later this quarter. Assuming performance trends continue as expected, we plan to complete repurchases of the remaining $1.5 billion available under a share repurchase authorization in 2025. Before I hand it back to Bob, I want to send out LUV's love to my Southwest family and to all of you in the investment community for your support and comradery over the past 33-plus years. With that, I will turn it back to Bob. Bob Jordan : Thank you, Tammy. As we wrap up, I want to emphasize a few points. First, the team is intensely focused on meeting and exceeding our targeted performance improvement trajectory. Second, our core business initiatives are performing ahead of expectations outlined only 4 months ago, and we expect to deliver or exceed the $1 billion 2025 EBIT contribution target. This excludes the benefit from any fleet transactions. Nonetheless, our goal remains to deliver $1.5 billion of targeted total 2025 incremental EBIT. Third, we are taking a hard look at our cost structure. Our cost performance, including in the first quarter is not where we want it to be. We are taking immediate actions to accelerate as much of the $500 million of targeted cost savings into 2025 as possible, and we will report on our progress as we go. Finally, we have tremendous confidence in the plan and are excited about the future of Southwest. We plan to repurchase $2.25 billion of stock this year or approximately 12% of our market cap at current prices. We expect this to be very accretive for our investors as we work to deliver our Southwest Even Better plan, including our North Star goal to achieve after tax ROIC of at least 15% in 2027. The pace of those share repurchases do not depend on the progress of our fleet monetization strategy. Now before I turn it to Q&A, I want to say a few words about Tammy. As you all know, Tammy will be retiring as our CFO at the end of this quarter after 33 years with the company. She has served in many roles and has the distinction of serving as our first Head of Investor Relations. She's been our Chief Financial Officer since 2012. Over the years, she's led us through times of great prosperity that provided for lucrative shareholder returns. She is an innovative leader who was instrumental in the success of countless endeavors. She leaves Southwest with a fortress balance sheet, investment grade rated by all three credit agencies and Tammy is a humble, generous and inspirational leader. She is a tireless mentor and as such leaves a strong legacy and you won't find a nicer, kinder and tougher person anywhere. So I'd like to thank Tammy for her deep commitment to our employees, the investment community and our shareholders. And Tammy, congrats on all you have accomplished. Thank you for your leadership and more importantly, your friendship. You will be missed. And on that note, I will pass it back to Julia to start our Q&A. Julia Landrum : Thank you, Bob, and congratulations Tammy. We LUV you too. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. We'd like to get to as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up if required. We will now take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. And if I may Tammy congratulations on the pending retirements. And one of your competitors once told me, or a counterpart at one of your competitor firms and told me that Southwest balance sheet is as being something on another planet in terms of the relative position. And I know that doesn't happen accidentally. So congrats. If I might for my first question and maybe to Tammy, unit cost here in the first quarter is moderating by about 3 points or maybe closer 5 if you consider that you don't have the sale leaseback gain in the quarter. And in your opening remarks, you talked about like a 1.5 point headwind in the second half from the cabin retrofit. Given all the moving parts, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cadence of unit cost growth for the rest of the year. Just to clarify that low single-digits exit rate, what type of a capacity growth that exit rate is on? Tammy Romo : Yes. First of all thank you for your kind words Savi. It's really been a pleasure, and you are wonderful. So, thank you. Just to give you a little bit of color on just the bridge for the 5 to 7 points from our midpoint of our guidance in the first quarter to the low single-digits exit rate in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s really coming from a couple of different buckets. We have, call it, 3 to 4 points from turn and redeye initiatives, so a big chunk of that's coming from just from the capacity. Hopefully, that helps answer your question there. It's probably 3 points, if I had to peg that and another point just from absorbing the over-staffing that we've discussed in previous calls. Then, there's another 2 to 3 point that is split fairly evenly between the lapping impacts from labor contracts that were ratified last year and just overall benefits from the cost plan initiative kicking in. As Bob and I both talked about in our remarks, we are very focused on our cost reduction efforts and those will of course ramp up as we go through the year. We're feeling good, as we sit here today about the exit rate and while some of that is coming from capacity, it's also coming from just an incredible amount of work from the team. Savi Syth : That's helpful Tammy. And maybe just following up on that. From a timing perspective, those kind of red-eye initiatives, I'm guessing they kind of kick in there in the second and third quarter. Is it kind of fairly consistent than the rest of the quarters, because in the second half you do have that kind of step-up in cabin retrofit? Tammy Romo : Yes. It ramps up with the biggest impact hitting in the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. Tammy, congrats. Good luck on the next phase of your career. I know you're going to miss all this fun. Tammy Romo : I'm going to miss you, Duane. Duane Pfennigwerth : Look, I wanted to ask you maybe a longer term question. There's a lot of symmetry right now between the industry backdrop and the renaissance that kicked off in 2012. And Southwest was really a big part of that renaissance. And as we go back and look at that period, you really had a multiyear period of margin expansion, RASM growth over CASM growth, not a quarter or two or timing shifts here and there, but a multiyear period of margin expansion. Now, some of that was macro growth and benign fuel prices, but really CASM growth for Southwest was modest despite the fact that, capacity growth was also modest and fairly tight over a multiyear period. So my question is, sorry, for the long winded lead in, from a unit cost perspective, do you see the potential to enter a similar multiyear period where you get modest unit cost growth on modest capacity growth or does better CASM really depend upon getting back to a period of higher growth? Bob Jordan : Yes, Duane, it's Bob. I'll take a shot and then Tammy can chime in. I think we're not ready to guide \u201826 and \u201827 CASM-X, but the exit rate for \u201825 at least gives you some indication of what we're striving for, maybe a reason, but we're striving for over the course of the rest of the plan, \u201826, \u201827. So, not unreasonable that we can have CASM in that low-single-digit range. And obviously, we have labor rate surety with the contracts closed out. We really don't have any openers of magnitude of \u201827. So yeah, I think that's absolutely it is absolutely doable. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And then maybe just for my follow-up, the certification process for your new seating configuration, can you give us an update there? What have you learned since last quarter or since Investor Day? And when does this really start in earnest? Bob Jordan : Yeah. Hey, Duane. We finalized really our cabin layouts, which allows us to finish up weight and balance certification with the FAA and get our STC certification. We'll get the weight and balance certification. We're planning for that. Of course, it's dependent on FAA timelines, but we're pretty confident we'll get that here in the first quarter and then the STC certification in the second and then that will -- we can begin retrofits following at that point. That goes along with Tammy's note on the retrofit cost being in the second half of the year. We'll get the retrofit started here midyear and then that will ramp through the remainder of the year. And we're confident that we've got the vendors in place, our employees are in place, to get the fleet retrofit before we get to our operate date. Operator : The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. And, I echo the comments of what everybody has said about Tammy. Tammy, it's been a lot of fun, and I think I've been there for the majority of those 33 years. So a good run. Anyway, just on questions. And in fact, I do have one for you, Tammy. When I think about the sale leaseback transaction that you guys took in the fourth quarter and so that was 35 airplanes call it $90 million I know that in the past you had indicated that we could see a margin boost upwards of call it maybe 2 points from the strategy. And so when I think about your revenue base for 2025, 2026 and I sort of look at this transaction and I realize not every transaction is going to be sort of sized this way. But it does seem like that we could be looking at maybe upwards of 100 airplanes on a sale leaseback basis. I mean, is that number too high? How should I think about it? And what sort of as a follow-up, what are you sort of targeting for 2025 with respect to sale leasebacks? And I know that there was a RFP for 30 outright divestitures. Where does that sit? So kind of a multipronged airplane question. Thanks for taking my question. Tammy Romo : Yes, no, thank you, Mike. And I think you're a lot of fun too. So on your question, I think the overarching theme here is we have a lot of levers we can pull to hit our targeted EBIT contribution from our fleet strategy. And the sale leasebacks are going to be dependent on our 800 exit strategy here. That's just really a technique to help us manage that and obviously to the extent the proceeds will go to our fleet modernization efforts obviously ultimately with the replacement of the MAX 8 because we get EBIT benefit from that as well. But the bulk -- and again we're going to just to be clear, those -- it will depend on the economics of those transactions and with the goal obviously to be NPV positive. So the bulk of the benefit really comes from sales of the excess aircraft that we do not need to hit our moderated capacity plans. So that of course is dependent on Boeing deliveries and just market conditions. But the main constraint there is, Boeing deliveries and Bob reported on Boeing in his remarks, they are ramping up and we did, I think have a pretty conservative estimate of what our deliveries are for this year at 38. So we will see where Boeing ends up, that's what makes your question a little bit tricky in terms of timing. But we could have potentially up to 50 to 55 deliveries and again those would go towards our fleet modernization efforts. So I think the takeaway here is that, we have a lot of levers, we're going to manage this very carefully. And again the goal with the Dash 800 is, we are exiting the NGs and the sale leaseback is just an effective tool to help us manage that. But the bulk of the program would come from sales. Bob Jordan : Yes. I was going to say, just the sale leaseback is just a pull forward sale, right? Our strong preference is sales, 800s to replace and lower operating costs and -8 to maximize the embedded value against the market that's in the fleet order book. Yes, I was just to say it again, the more Boeing can deliver, the more we can execute this strategy in 2025. I was in Seattle last week and really encouraged by what I saw on the line, the processes, the procedures, slack time coming out, sort of all the things you want to see. They have long ways to go. But pending something that we don't know about, I'm optimistic, strongly optimistic they can exceed the 38. We probably have upside to 50, 55. So that would certainly help in executing the fleet strategy on the sales side. So a lot to be seen here. I think we'll know a lot once we know whether Boeing breaks rate 38 in March, early April. I expect that they will. We'll have to see. And then I think that puts us in a good spot to really update you on what we now expect in terms of deliveries and what we now think we can execute in terms of the fleet monetization plan. Tammy Romo : Yes. And Mike, I just wanted to make one more. I just want to be really clear on this. We are working to get to our 2027 target which is without fleet. At the end of the day, we -- our core base business, where we are aiming to get to our 15% return on invested capital of at least 15% and op margins of excluding special items of greater than 10%. So that's really -- we're talking a lot about fleet, but I just don't want that to get lost in the conversation. Operator : The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien: Good afternoon, everyone, and maybe I haven't been here for all of the 33 years like Mike has. But Tammy, it's truly been a pleasure to work with you. So congratulations on the career on quite a career and happy retirement. So I have 1 quick revenue one and then 1 quick fleet one for you, Tammy, but maybe I'll start on revenue. The 4Q RASM result you mentioned that the beat was driven in part by stronger holiday peak and then also the ramp of revenue management. Can you just help us think about broad strokes, how much each of those buckets contributed? And how do we think about the pacing of that $1 billion in tactical revenue-driven initiatives in 2025. How much of your 1Q guide does that drive versus general industry environment? And how does that build for the year? Andrew Watterson : It's always hard to completely tear apart accurately the -- I would say that if you got to look at kind of sequentially how our RASM went from Q3 to Q4, and how that compares to our norms, how the other airlines -- how they sequentially progress and how it compares to their norms, you see a level of outperformance with Southwest Airlines. -- do the same thing in Q4 to Q1, you see that same amount. You see the same effect, if you will, of an outperformance on a sequential basis. This gives you an idea that it's some -- there's some company-specific things that are happening there. And that gives us confidence in hopefully our investors\u2019 confidence that we're seeing that kind of RASM reversion that we need back to our historical levels to hit our plan. Now within that, kind of tearing them apart each of these by design elements of our tactical initiatives are self-reinforcing. The network changes the revenue management changes, the marketing changes, all those work together. So really, the order of operations of quantifying it, whatever you go with first, it gets a bigger benefit, so to speak. Now revenue management did have a stronger impact in Q4 and into Q1 than the other 2. So that's why we called it out in our prepared remarks, but they're all kind of contributing. So I think for that idiosyncratic southwest part is those 3 combined, and we see that progressing throughout the year. I will say the ones that we highlighted in Investor Day where they kind of are getting back to our normal kind of yield discount, if you will, versus our competitors -- and getting back our load factor to norm. So the 2 kind of big levers we highlighted that will be signals of us progressing that we did -- we had more progress than, frankly, I expected on the yield side and then a little most parks on load factor. So as we go throughout the year, I expect to keep and grow that yield benefit and then load factor would be the 1 that comes second throughout the year. So I think if you look closely at those each quarter, you'll get an idea of how we're progressing the tactical initiatives. Catherine O'Brien: That's great. And then I guess 1 last question for Tammy. On the fleet strategy, you've called out you expect that to contribute about $500 million in EBIT on average per year. I understand that's very fluid. Tammy, in your answer to Mike, I think you made it clear that the bulk of that will come from straight sales, not sale-leasebacks. Should we think of sale leasebacks as offsetting that positive sale impact? Just with the first leaseback the increased rent over 3 years offset the gain on the decrease in D&A? Or do we need to be adding like other items like lower maintenance dispatch reliability. I guess what I'm really getting at is, do you expect the net of gain aircraft front and D&A for these sale leasebacks to also be EBIT positive? Or how do we think about that? Tammy Romo : Yes. No, great question, Catie. Yes, when we look at our sale-leaseback opportunities, we -- our goal and our intention is to do all of this and NPV be positive way. So while yes, you're recognizing a gain when you sell the aircraft, and there is increased rents that would exceed the depreciation expense. Again, these are short-term sale leasebacks, again, to help manage the exit of the 800 fleet. But when we look at that in total, it would -- it's NPV positive, and that's the way we're constructing our fleet strategy here. So but we're taking into account all of the considerations that you just mentioned maintenance, et cetera. And we've got, again, a lot of levers we can pull to do this in an NPV positive way. And hopefully, that helps. Operator : The next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Dan McKenzie : Tammy, I have to jump on the bandwagon here and say huge congrats on such an extended run as a CFO and at Southwest, of course. A couple of questions here. Following up on my question. And when all is said and done, how much cash could potentially be unlocked from the balance sheet from these sales? And so I guess my question is how many aircraft fall into that attractive mid-age bucket -- and over how many years could these sales potentially occur if you wanted to pull the trigger? Tammy Romo : Yes. Well, first of all, thank you, Dan. And it's been a pleasure working with you over the years. So we're not going to give specific guidance on the total proceeds. We've got if you look at our -- if we look at our order book, and I shared this at Investor Day, we just have airplanes in excess of the aircraft that we're going to need here over the next 3-year period to hit our 1% to 2% capacity growth target. So that gives us the proceeds from that would obviously be significant. And again, what we're focused on is hitting the operating margin targets that we provided you at Investor Day as well as the return on invested capital. So not prepared to give you that today because, again, this depends on the market. And we're going to do transactions that make financial sense and that are prudent to the bottom line. And again, we're managing our invested capital base with those proceeds and focused on exiting our NG fleet by 2031, which will set us up really well for the next generation in terms of CapEx requirements to fund future growth. So I'm not trying to give you a non-answer. I'm really not just not prepared to walk you through specifics because it really does depend on Boeing here and the market. Bob Jordan : And Dan, just chiming in, I think just to quickly add, I've said this many, many times, we're committed to extracting every dime out of that value -- embedded value in the order book. So I think we have 672 right now. So what -- the commitment is whatever the exact strategy in terms of how every transaction lays out, the intent is to pull every bit of value out for ourselves and our shareholders. And if you run this out, yes, you get to an average fleet age, I think, a 5 all MAX fleet. That's terrific. It's very low. So there's also work to do, I think, to look at the intersection of optimizing a still really good -- really good industry-leading fleet age and the number of aircraft that could be excess at current capacity rates. So there's work to do to maybe tackle exactly what is optimal in terms of your question. And then last -- you didn't ask this, but there have been some discussion of this fleet strategy related maybe to what some others are doing. And the difference is, to me, we have excess aircraft with strong embedded values because of the credits and our own value pricing, especially on the MAX 8s, and we're using the cash proceeds to buy back stock and deliver value to our shareholders and to modernize the fleet and lower operating costs. So that's -- that excess cash is going to work for the right things. So again, the exact optimal intersection of the fleet age and the number of transactions sort of TBD, but we're certainly going to run it out to a very attractive fleet age. Dan McKenzie : Yes, that's perfect. Second question here is a balance sheet question. I believe the plan is to pay down the debt coming due this year. I think it's $2.9 billion in the first half, if I'm not mistaken, but please correct me on that. But where would that leave the balance sheet metrics? And secondly, would that open the door for the Board to consider an acceleration of capital returns once you hit those metrics? Tammy Romo : Yes. So we're -- yes, we would -- the plan is to continue to reduce our leverage here as we go, as we shared at Investor Day and will obviously address that question here as we go with the Board. Bob Jordan : Yes. Obviously, we're committed to maintain what everyone is praising Tammy for here, a strong balance sheet and maintaining the appropriate level of leverage. Obviously, there's a range to everything here, and we'll be taking that up with the board. Tammy Romo : Yes. And you know our target there is the mid-30% range. So obviously, the pay down of debt this year will put us closer to that goal. Operator : There's time for one more question. It will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : This is Catherine on for Ravi. We also wanted to thank you, Tammy, for all your help over the past few years, and we congratulate you as well. I was just wondering if you had thoughts on overall industry capacity in maybe 2Q through 3Q and whether you're confident that may come down from what we're seeing maybe in schedules or if there's any areas of pockets overcapacity that you're seeing specifically? Andrew Watterson : Yes, certainly. I would say that schedules are really firm for Q1. And our schedules are relatively pretty far out because we don't like to republish some level of adjustments necessary given the Boeing delivery situation we just discussed here for the last hour. But a lot of the airlines take an approach of modifying substantially capacity closer in. So as a result, summer and beyond, we don't view as complete yet. And so we'll wait until those firm up before we make an assessment of what the back half of the year is going to look like. Some airlines having published beyond kind of mid-May. So it's still in flux, but what we do see is published and firm is, I think, a constructive backdrop. Bob Jordan : Yes. And Catherine, one of the questions we get a lot, obviously, is how long does the constructive backdrop persists? And despite the optimism that we fill with Boeing, there's still a lot of work to do to get back to the significant rates and completely get supply chain healthy. Obviously, on the Airbus side, you've got the gear turbo fan and long, long span times on engines. And so I'm of the view that despite the improvements we're seeing in the constructive backdrop driven by -- especially manufacturing constraints still exists for years ahead. So this is not something that's going to come off anytime soon. So I think it's going to remain constructive for quite a while. Unidentified Analyst : And just as a quick follow-up. I know you guys have kind of talked about your plans for retrofitting aircraft for the premium cabin. But I was just curious if you could give us a quick update on the progress you've made since the Investor Day, maybe something that you've been excited about or that you've done since then. Bob Jordan : Yes, Catherine. We covered the retrofits, the progress there, which is good. earlier in the call, I think the -- getting the amendment done with Chase is another key step in are the path towards selling and operating in an assigned and premium environment, we needed to switch kind of our boarding benefits over to boarding and seating benefits, which I think our customers will be out with the details soon and with our customers. But I think what we've built there in partnership with Chase is going to be really exciting for customers. I think it's going to drive co-brand card acquisitions in the future. So definitely excited about that. And just generally, I'm pleased with our progress overall. Technology development is going well. The team broadly across Southwest has really rallied around this as a key priority for the company. Everybody understands the value to our customers, value to shareholders. And value to our employees. And I just think that the pace of execution has been really good, and the focus is there. So I'm encouraged by our progress and what's left to come here over the balance of the year. Andrew Watterson : I would also add, Ryan, we started -- we intend to dynamically price the seats and the new product. And we went live with dynamic pricing for our upgraded boarding product. this quarter, just actually just recently, and that's going to kind of give us kind of training the models and giving us practices and the processes and technologies for almost a full year here before we go live. So I think that's a kind of early win. It will help us this year, but also as a proof point of our technology acumen in advance of the new product. Bob Jordan : 100% agree. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney. Whitney Eichinger : Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin to hear your questions, could you please remind everyone how to share -- how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I just had a quick question on the amended credit card deal. With your forecast that it's going to really drive acquisitions of the card up -- are you offering any kind of a forecast in terms of how your remuneration from Chase may expand and some idea of what that could be on an annual basis going forward? Bob Jordan : Mary, I'll start, and I'm sure Ryan will add. I just wanted to say first, thanks to our team and to our Chase partners. It's a big amendment, and we move through it with speed and pace, and so I'm just -- I'm very grateful. But now we're really for the new deal, it does include significant additional compensation. I think you could think of it as competitive with recent deals in the market that I'm sure you're familiar with. It was contemplated in our Investor Day plan. But no, we're not going to -- we just -- we're not able to provide exact details on the financials. But Ryan, if you want to add anything? Ryan Green : No, it's -- we're pleased to get it done. It's a proof point in plan. And like you said, it's absolutely very competitive with what's out there with legacy carriers in the market. Operator : The next question is from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Two quick questions. One, -- has there been a shift in Southwest approach to DEI? There's been some attention paid to the change in title from your Vice President of DEI changing the corporate citizenship and Chief Inclusion Officer. That's question one. Question 2, very different question is [indiscernible] Southwest any updates on that in terms of how you work with the travel trade travel advisers. Andrew Watterson : I'll start with the second one first. With that one, we have no changes to announce in general, were as we previously discussed were a direct-to-consumer business. And so great majority of the business case is predicated on selling to our current customers, who want to buy packages, but who are unfulfilled by Southwest Airlines. So we'll be able to offer them what they want to buy in or buying today. And so we think that will be a benefit. Whether we work with a trade or not, how much -- we do at the margin in some situations, and there's nothing to philosophy against that, but mostly the business case is predicated on direct sales. But as we get closer to go live, we'll firm up our trade policies. Bob Jordan : And Robert, on the DEI question, whether it's today, 5 years ago, 10 years ago or 20 years ago, I [indiscernible] 37 years. We've always worked hard to hire people who are just nice. They fit the culture. And to create an environment that is inclusive and we use the word belonging, People just feel good about being here. They like coming to work. They like their team, and they feel like they belong at Southwest. And then as it relates to hiring and promotions, they've always been merit-based and no different across our history. So no, no changes in terms of how we think about how we treat people and how we reward people. Now obviously, there's a lot of questions about the flurry of executive orders as needed, we'll be evaluating those and understanding what we may need to do. And so I think just sort of stay tuned there. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session for media. So back over to Whitney now for some closing thoughts. Whitney Eichinger : If anyone has any further questions, our communications group is standing by. Their contact information along with today's news release are all available at swamedia.com. Operator : The conference has concluded. Thank you all for attending. We'll meet again here next quarter.",
