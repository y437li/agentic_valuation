Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the PayPal's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Rabinovitch, you may begin. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrea. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holding's earnings release conference call for the first quarter 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the second quarter and full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics. We believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 27, 2016. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle. Before I start my remarks, I want to take a quick moment to officially welcome you. We're thrilled to have you join PayPal as our new head of IR. And I want to thank all of you on the call for joining us. We know how busy your schedules are, so we appreciate your time. I'm very pleased to report that PayPal delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2016. In many ways, this was our best quarter in the time since I joined PayPal and it's gratifying to see the company execute against our goals. The mission of PayPal is clear. We want to become an everyday essential financial service for consumers and provide a full service solution and platform that enables digital commerce for merchants around the globe. And we continue to make tangible and consistent progress towards that vision. We are showing strong growth across all of our operational metrics. We ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, up from 179 million last quarter. Our enhanced value proposition is attracting new users at an accelerating rate and in turn, attracting new partners, and new merchants. The larger our scale, the more important and relevant we become in the ecosystem as our network effect becomes ever stronger. Our increased scale combined with continued growing engagement resulted in some of the strongest payment volume and revenue growth rates in our recent history, and clearly demonstrate our leadership in digital and mobile payments around the world. Our total payment volume growth, or TPV, accelerated to 31% on an FX-neutral basis. And our merchant services volume grew a record 39%, leading to revenue growth of 23% on an FX-neutral basis. We ended the quarter with over 14 million merchant accounts. I just pause on that number for a moment. Our two-sided network with 14 million merchants on one side and over 170 million buyers on the other is one of our key competitive advantages and extremely difficult to replicate. We are proud to have added this quarter popular and influential brands like Crate and Barrel, Sephora, Air France, FreshDirect, Panera Bread and Woolworths, which is the largest grocery chain in Australia serving more than 28 million customers each week. These brands joined a growing list of companies that are choosing PayPal. As I mentioned, merchant services payment volume grew 39% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly higher than the rate of e-commerce growth. Our increasing ability to innovate and lead transformative change for merchants and consumers is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation, but enabling us to once again increase our share in a dynamic and competitive environment. Each quarter, we measure the success of our business against four key metrics : our top line growth, our net active customer base, our customer engagement, and our ability to generate strong free cash flow. I'm pleased to report we delivered strong performance against each of these metrics. Let me start with revenue. We grew our top line to $2.54 billion, up 23% on an FX-neutral basis or 19% on a spot basis. This was our strongest quarter for revenue growth in the last five quarters. As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, demonstrating another strong quarter of customer acquisition. All of you know by now that our long-term aspiration is to position PayPal as an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. And increasing the level of customer engagement is one of our primary measures of success in that goal. And despite an ever increasing account base, I'm pleased to say we grew the annual transactions for active account from 25 in Q1 a year ago to 28 this quarter, which resulted in PayPal processing 1.4 billion transactions for our customers during the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. Customer engagement was driven by significant enhancements to our value proposition, and by the debut of PayPal's first Super Bowl ad, which drove significant increases in the perception of PayPal in the weeks that followed the commercial's first airing. And last but certainly not least, we generated strong free cash flow of $605 million in Q1, up over 70% year-over-year. I'm obviously pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute throughout the rest of the year. We need to continually innovate if we are to widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q1 saw the introduction of several strong new product experiences across our global customer base. We launched a new fundamentally redesigned PayPal mobile app in 145 markets simultaneously, in 17 languages, across both iOS and Android operating systems. The app is built on an iterative platform so that we can now easily customize and localize new features across all the markets where it's live. The new experience is driving increased consumer engagement, increased send and request money transactions and will enable our consumers to use their mobile phone online, in app or in store with both NFC and QR capabilities. Venmo continues to go from strength to strength, processing nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year. And its subscriber base continues to grow at an ever-accelerating rate. We made good progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. Early customer results and feedback have provided strong validation around the demand for Venmo as a way to pay in app. This feedback has helped us to fine tune our processes, procedures and value proposition. And we have now widened our pilot to include approximately 550,000 Venmo users. We are on track to expand to more merchants and open the service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year. We introduced PayPal Commerce, a set of tools and APIs which are currently in beta that make it easier for merchants to securely sell across multiple context; e-mail, social share, blogs, articles, ads, in-app, and anywhere consumers are online or on their mobile devices. This new offering is the result of the rapid integration of the technology and the team we gained through the acquisition of Modest in August 2015. It is a critical element of the full service suite of capabilities we are building into our merchant platform as we help retailers move fully into digital commerce. Our increased pace and global scale of innovation is fueled by the investments we have made in our core infrastructure and platform. They are designed to drive agility and innovation across our entire software stack. We run one of the largest private cloud environments in the world. We follow industry best practices of agile software development, continuous integration and delivery using open source technologies. These investments have enabled our developers to push code several times a day, allowing them to iterate new features faster and get instant customer feedback. To drive that point home, the number of production deployments has increased by 200% compared to last year. Our increased ability to innovate on a global scale and deliver on our commitments is a primary reason why PayPal is becoming the partner of choice for companies around the world, including some of the leading tech companies and the largest wireless carriers in Mexico, Latin America and Europe. Telcel and Claro are implementing our platform to help their 140 million consumers manage their money and make every day purchases using their mobile devices. These digital wallet offerings are now in trial and we expect a full rollout in the second half of the year starting in Mexico and Brazil. The app will be available for download for both the Android and iOS and consumers will be able to easily create and manage a new PayPal account using only their smartphone and will be able to pay for basic Telco services including topping up their prepaid phones and buying related data plans. Eventually, they will be able to conveniently pay for services from other merchants as well as paying bills, and sending money. Our partnership with Vodafone in Europe will have tens of millions of European customers to use PayPal as their preferred way to fund their payments. And for the first time, consumers with Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals will be able to tap, to pay in store. We are now live in our first market, Spain, and we anticipate expanding across Europe throughout the back half of 2016. Our partnership with Vodafone delivers what consumers, businesses and European regulators want, better products, more choice and greater transparency. In the quarter, we also extended our relationships with both Alibaba and Facebook. Our pilot with Alibaba Wholesaler has been extended and we will now do a full rollout to include new countries and merchants. And our partnership with Facebook continues to expand nicely, both in the Messenger and Facebook Shop applications and as a key partner across a wide range of their core payments' experiences. Q1 also saw us deepen and expand our relationship with commerce platforms that make selling online and on mobile simpler for businesses around the world. We signed an agreement with WooCommerce to make PayPal their preferred payment extension for their platform. We also extended our relationship with Shopify, one of the largest commerce platforms which powers 243,000 businesses in approximately 150 countries to provide all new Shopify merchants with PayPal as their default payment experience. One Touch expanded to merchants in an additional 121 markets across Asia, Europe and Central America, making it available to merchants in 144 markets and it's now available to consumers in all 203 markets in which we operate. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product PayPal has ever launched. It now has some 21 million consumers who have proactively opted in and we anticipate well over 2 million merchants will have One Touch enabled by year end. We continue to see meaningful engagement and conversion lift with the use of One Touch, enabling both consumers and merchants to have a more seamless and friction-free checkout experience. In fact, a recent comScore study rated PayPal's conversion rate for merchants at 87%, with the next highest service at 51%. Clearly for merchants and consumers, PayPal is a far superior choice. I'm also very pleased with the performance of our Xoom acquisition and our integration efforts. Global expansion meaningfully accelerated in the first months following the close of the acquisition. So far this year, Xoom has expanded its service to 11 new countries with two more countries coming very shortly. These include Haiti, Nigeria and Slovakia and we also announced an integration with M-Pesa in Kenya. Xoom continues to be a market leader in mobile, with some 70% of transactions in the quarter happening on a mobile device. And Q1 was a record activation quarter, with net new actives up over 70% year-over-year as we begin to see some of the synergies we expected come to fruition. Being a leading global payments provider requires exceptional effort and continued investment in our risk and compliance functions across all of our markets and all of our product areas. There are many reasons to do this. We live in a time where global terrorism and cybercrime are on the rise and as a result, increasing our focus on compliance is obviously the right thing to do. But we are also investing in these areas because we know that a strong risk and compliance infrastructure is a deep competitive advantage. And the more advanced our capabilities in these areas, the greater the trust our customers will have in PayPal and in our ever-expanding value proposition. A great example of this is the relationship we have built with our regulators as it relates to our PayPal Credit offerings. We have seen our Net Promoter Score for PayPal Credit jump to over 70% in March, a clear demonstration that what regulators want and what we want are truly aligned around delighting and protecting our customers. I'll end my remarks with the following reflection. Although Q1 was clearly a strong start to 2016, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to deliver on our product roadmap and expand our leadership position. We have an expansive and an important mission. And I can assure you our team is focused on executing, partnering within our ecosystem and driving new innovative and meaningful value to our merchants and consumers. And with that, let me hand it over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth, all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81 billion, an increase of 31% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 30% while international growth was 32%. We grew faster than e-commerce market and continue to gain market share. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working as we focus on being the customer champion and move from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. We added 4.5 million new active accounts, ending the quarter with 184 million. We continue to extend our global reach with 56% of the total active accounts outside of the U.S. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 26% year-over-year, driven predominantly by the increasing relevance and ubiquity of our platform, as we continue to have strong growth in our core business and Braintree. In addition, PayPal is driving the growth of mobile payments and an increasing amount of our business is conducted on mobile devices. During the quarter, we processed $21 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 54%. With capabilities and services like peer-to-peer, credit, and remittances, as well as strong mobile growth, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 28, up 12% from a year ago. We generated more than $2.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter, up 23% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, transaction revenue increased 21%, which benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions for active customer account. This increase also reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree as we move from a payment button to a full services payment partner where we capture all of the merchants' processing volumes. Revenue from other value-added services grew 38% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by the growth of PayPal Credit as well as the amended contract with Synchrony Financial last year. We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 20%. Our volume based expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 32%, in line with payment volume. Other expenses grew at approximately half the rate of revenue growth as we gained economies of scale. Excluding Xoom, which was not in our results in the first quarter last year, our other expenses increased only 6%. As we stated in the past, our strategy is to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers but results in a lower take rate from volume-based pricing. This strategy has driven accelerated volume and revenue growth as well as market share gains. Our fast-growing Braintree platform also provides solutions for large and next generation merchants and brings with it a higher mix of card payments. As a result, our overall transaction margin for the quarter declined 380 basis points. While large merchants in Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, they increased our overall operating income dollars. In the quarter, operating margin declined 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding Xoom, however, our margin increased, demonstrating that our core business is performing well and we are doing a good job controlling costs. We are one quarter in after completing the acquisition of Xoom and we are even more excited about what it brings to the platform. But as I previously stated, Xoom will be dilutive to operating margin in 2016. In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $133 million, or approximately 5% of revenue. Free cash flow in the quarter was $605 million, representing $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This was higher than we expected from better operating results as well as the timing of certain working capital items. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in the U.S. And now to guidance, our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in Q1 reinforces our conviction in our strategy and the opportunity before us. We still have three quarters to execute against for the year, but we are off to a good start. As a result, we are affirming our full year guidance ranges for 2016. However, I'd like to provide you with some context for how we're thinking about the year. The retail landscape continues to be mixed. And we still face pressure from the movement of currencies relative to the dollar on our international business. We continue to see volume accelerate across our platform, driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these newer businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset. There is still much of the year to play out but our first quarter performance provides us with increased confidence in achieving our goals. As I stated on the call last quarter, we had some lumpiness in our revenue growth due to several one-time items in 2015. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect an approximate six point deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our credit receivables, and the impact of the amended Synchrony agreement last year, both of which were virtually 100% margin. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis to be between 16% and 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36. We plan to return to a more normalized growth rate in the back half of the year. Our business model of strong top line growth, expense control and low capital intensity, gives us the ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. We initiated the share buyback program that was announced on our last earnings call and repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $35 per share. I'd like to take a moment to talk about our credit products, which complement our digital payments platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of TPV and has been relatively consistent at that level over the last couple of years. Credit is a flywheel for PayPal, which benefits both our consumers as well as our merchants. It drives payment volume growth and increases choice for our customers by providing them with flexible payment options and allowing customers to pay over time. But credit benefits PayPal in many ways beyond just a payment transaction. Credit reduces cart abandonment, leading to increased conversion for merchants and an increase in basket size on purchases for the average purchase of a credit customer is 20% to 30% larger. Additionally, our working capital product continues to gain momentum and helps to deepen our relationship with merchants while helping them grow. We typically see merchant sales increase after receiving our working capital loan. Satisfaction rates are very high and we experience reduced merchant churn. Beginning this quarter, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers, which would have previously been funded with our own cash. The use of the full amount of these funds will depend upon the growth of our European credit business. This is a highly efficient source of funding to support our credit business and we continue to explore alternatives to pursue an asset-light model. In closing, we are off to a strong start to the year. As a technology platform leader, operating globally at scale, we are driving the digitization of payments in a large, dynamic and growing industry. We are focused on delivering shareholder value with our strong revenue growth and cash generation. We're excited about the opportunity ahead, and look forward to sharing more at our Analyst Day next month. With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. You guys spoke to the decline in the transaction margin and it was pretty significant year-over-year. I guess two related questions. One is how should we think about the trajectory of that margin going forward in terms of the declines related to mix? And then second, as far as lower European Interchange is concerned, should we assume that the first quarter is fully loaded for that impact? Thanks. John Rainey : Sanjay, this is John. How's it going? First, with respect to transaction margin, as we've seen for a couple quarters now, there's definitely pressure there. But I would remind you that's a deliberate part of our strategy as we're trying to increase the ubiquity of PayPal and allow our customers to use PayPal at larger merchants where we're going to see pressure on take rate. Fortunately for us, we have the ability to offset that with the operating leverage in our business. And as a management team, we're focused on our margins, our generation of free cash flow and growing EPS and not getting so focused on just one aspect of the P&L being the transaction margin. So, you'll continue to see us demonstrate the ability to offset some of that decline. With respect to mix, as we said before, we expected the impact of that 2016 to be relatively de minimis and our first quarter results actually validated that. It was fairly negligible in the quarter and we would expect, to your question, a similar impact for the balance of the year. Daniel Schulman : I'd just add a couple of things. Sanjay Sakhrani : And my follow-up... Daniel Schulman : Just [indiscernible]\u2026 Sanjay Sakhrani : Just around the new account growth, maybe you can just parse out which channels you're seeing the most success in terms of growth? Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Yeah, let me first jump on a little bit of John's answer and just supplement it. First of all, as we've said all along, the margins in this business tend to want to go up. In fact, if you excluded Xoom from our results in the quarter, our margins would have gone up year-over-year. The take rate is a direct result of the strategy that we're implementing. First thing is we want more ubiquity for PayPal consumers. The more ubiquity there is for them to shop, the more they use us, the more engagements they have, the more satisfied they are with the service and it gives us a flywheel effect. And as John mentioned, every one of those dollars that come in from our merchants are obviously profitable dollars for us. The large merchants have lower take rates. That's just the way of the world, more volume, more pricing leverage. The second piece is we are trying to become a full services platform to enable merchants to move into digital commerce. That means we want to do 100% share of their payment processing. We want to be a strategic partner with them. We want to enable their business strategy. And the more we do that, the closer we get to our merchants, the better off that is for us. Churn goes down, more branded business comes towards us. But of course, as we go move more towards that product mix, you also see some margin because that mix of product has a lower margin set as well. But overall, when we include our branded on that, that's a net positive for us. So we're really comfortable with the strategy. It inevitably leads to at least for now because we are penetrating a lot of that larger merchant base and we'll start to see more normalized stuff come out of that. But for now, that is the right strategy for us and it is paying off in all sorts of benefits for us. In terms of net new account growth, we are seeing that throughout the world right now. As John mentioned, over half of our actives are outside of the U.S. So we're seeing good growth across the world. We're obviously seeing very good growth in our core PayPal acquisition as well as in Venmo. So I would basically say we've got good, consistent growth that spans from our newer services to our core business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that our value proposition has significantly improved over the course of the last year, year and a half or so and consumers are beginning to see that. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Great, thanks. Good results here. Just wanted to dig into what's driving the TPV acceleration. I think you called out a mixed retail landscape. So how much of the acceleration is from, say, merchant additions you called out, the backlog of full service deals, et cetera? Daniel Schulman : Yeah, I'll take that. I think what's really driving the TPV growth is obviously and no surprise here, our net new actives have grown by some 19 million, 20 million net new active additions over the past year. Over the last two quarters, you've seen acceleration in the number of net new ads that we put on to the business. Engagement is growing. Engagement is growing because our value proposition is getting better. One Touch is increasing engagement, our new mobile app is increasing engagement and conversion is also going up because of those value propositions. We obviously are also expanding partnerships right now. All the investment that we've done in the tech stack over the course of the last three plus years is really paying off in our ability to work with the most technically savvy and sophisticated partners and be able to deliver digital and mobile payment experience that we think is best-in-class. So these new partnerships are helping. And the more merchant \u2013 consumers we get, more merchants want to come onboard and you saw some of those in my remarks. But we're now over 14 million merchants. So it's a combination of a better value proposition, more partnerships, expanded merchants and then really driving our net new consumers and the engagement per consumer; all of that is adding up to very strong volume growth. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it, that's helpful. Just as my follow-up, just on Xoom, I think last call you talked about how you still see a line of sight to that becoming margin accretive. How much of the current drag is driven by your accelerated country expansion efforts and maybe some integration caused that you'll maybe lap sooner rather than later? Thanks. John Rainey : Yeah, we've said that we expect Xoom to be margin dilutive this year. And I wouldn't expect necessarily the back half of the year to look that much different than the front half. But it's \u2013 to your point, as you can see from and hear from Dan's prepared remarks, this is an area that we're investing in and we would expect it to start generating more significant profits in 2017. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Thank you. John Rainey : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Dan and John, I wanted to follow up on your comments about PayPal Credit. You've made it clear that credit is important because it helps fuel growth and has the flywheel effects that you described. But how much do you worry about the lower valuation multiple that the market ascribes to businesses that face credit risk? And is that really the reason why you are exploring asset-light to basically identify a partner with a strong balance sheet so that they could help you retain all the benefits of the credit product without taking on the credit risk? Daniel Schulman : Yeah, hey, Bill. It's a great question. So as we've said pretty consistently, we are not in credit for credit sake. We are in credit because it drives both consumer benefits and merchant benefits and drives the overall flywheel for PayPal. Any which way you look at it, it drives increased basket size, increased conversion, PayPal Working Capital, significantly increases the volume that we see coming on to PayPal, significantly increases the NPS scores. So we see a lot of benefit in the overall PayPal ecosystem. But we can do this, and will continue to do this in an asset-light manner. Credit is a small part of our overall business. It will likely remain a small part of our overall business. And ways of figuring out how to do that in asset-light and capital efficient manners are a goal of ours. Synchrony, the partnership we have with them is a good example of that. I think you can expect us to be looking at those kinds of things to become increasingly asset-light. We don't need to do all of this or even a great portion of this necessarily on our own balance sheet. We can work with partners because the important thing to us is the flywheel effect. John Rainey : I would just \u2013 I would add to that, Bill, that another aspect that we look at is the volatility or \u2013 and one of the things that we really try to focus on is reducing the volatility of our earnings. And I think it's important that you understand that we have a lot of ways that we can manage any volatility irrespective whether it comes from credit or other aspects of our business. But to Dan's point, credit is about 2% of our volume today. And if you were to just take 2015 growth rates of credit and the rest of our business, it would take a couple decades before credit even got to 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. So this is something that, to Dan's point, we want to utilize it because it complements our platform, but I'd like to allay some of the concerns that are out there right now around this because it's not something that I think is going to have any kind of dramatic impact in terms of the volatility to us. Bill Carcache : Thank you. I wanted to also follow up on your comments around partnering with other players in the ecosystem. You guys have previously said that steering and data sharing were two issues that were at the center of your discussions with other players, but that those were very solvable. Maybe could you talk about whether there have been any changes in philosophy around how you think about the sharing of data, and perhaps any commentary around the steering issue? It was interesting to hear MasterCard say at a recent conference that they're okay with the notion that PayPal has been \u2013 has thrown out around customer choice, and that's something that they could live with. I was hoping \u2013 there's a lot there, but just around those topics, just hoping you could give a little bit of color and that's it. Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. Sure, of course. So we're in good and meaningful discussions across the entire ecosystem right now. And I'm hopeful that that leads to a win-win for a number of parties. Just take a step back and give a little bit of context. One of the things that we talked about inside PayPal all the time now is how do we become the ultimate customer champion company. And being a customer champion company means providing the very best experience to our customers. And when we think about the very best experience; that means giving our customers full choice and optionality about where they want to pay and how they want to pay. And to us, that just makes a ton of sense and we've done a lot of work around this as you can imagine and a lot of research and a lot of experimentation. And here's what we see. When we do that, we drive a heck of a lot of more net ads than we have in our traditional signup process. And engagement and conversion go up meaningfully. So that obviously drives increased revenues and volumes for us. Funding mix may shift slightly but the difference between ACH and debit has narrowed substantially over the last couple of years. Different regulatory environments have narrowed a lot of the payment option tightened. So \u2013 and we would also expect some tradeoff with incremental volumes that we could drive on to networks and pricing that we would receive from potential partners. In addition, we are very willing to share data back with the issuers and the networks. That really is a legacy of the past as best as I can see. And this sort of new model of customer choice of data sharing, and all of us having a common foe in cash transactions. We all want to electronify more and more payments and that's all attractive and additive to the entire ecosystem. And so that eliminates a lot of the previous perceived friction that might have been out in the ecosystem. And furthermore, we want a partner. We think that's the right thing to go and do. And so we'll see where all this goes but as I said, it has the opportunity to be a win for all of us in the ecosystem. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great. Dan, you've talked in the past and provided some specifics around the state of the pipeline of business or merchants that you're on-boarding. Just wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on that [indiscernible] how it compares to where you were back when you last updated in January or the business that you did last year? And then just as we \u2013 as you talk through the improved engagement around One Touch, is there any way that you can quantify that for us, either in the amount of TPV that One Touch users use or are using after they sign up for One Touch or their engagements in a specific period that would provide some additional color around that benefit? Daniel Schulman : Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the question, Heath. So first thing in terms of pipeline, we're improving our capabilities as rapidly as we can to onboard live to site that pipeline of sales that we have for Braintree and in our core business. So that's improved quite a bit, but I will say despite the improvement, we are still seeing a large demand and pipeline of additional sales coming in for our platforms. Yeah, I'd say it's a high class problem to have. And the value proposition of Braintree is, I think, the whole team there is doing a great job in driving that. The core propositions of PayPal are getting better really. They're really starting to execute against this idea of being a full services platform, really being almost the underlying operating system for digital commerce. And then that is \u2013 that's resonating with the merchant population and so we still have a very strong pipeline being \u2013 waiting to go live to site and a strong pipeline of merchants that we're talking to in the middle of the sales process with them as well. In terms of One Touch, we've said from the very beginning that we see meaningful lift in not just conversion vis-\u00e0-vis our other products but also engagement in terms of how often a consumer uses PayPal because really as you can imagine, taking friction out of the checkout experience is just a really positive thing. It's really positive for consumers and it's really positive for merchants. And seeing that comScore study that basically, as you know, our nearest alternative service at 51% and us at 87% can give you an idea of the lift in conversion. The other place that I would point to is you can see kind of where PayPal conversion was before One Touch and other comScore studies and where it is now and you can get a sense of some of the lift for that by looking at some of those external studies. But you'll see it's a meaningful lift in conversion overall. That's obviously beginning to help us in our results. And hopefully as we continue to onboard more and more consumers on that, we'll continue to help drive some of our future growth. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks, Dan. Daniel Schulman : You're welcome, Heath. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. All right, very quickly, can you just illuminate a little bit what drove the couple of basis point uptick in transaction expenses? Is it mix in Braintree or is it actually underlying card mix in the core PayPal platform? And then similarly, it looked like transaction and loan losses upticked again, even though you said that PayPal Credit is holding steady at 2% of TPV. So, can you just give a little color around those drivers? Thanks. John Rainey : Sure, Lisa. So the first \u2013 the answer to your first question about the increase in transaction expense is related to mix of Braintree. Of course, that being more card-based, but that as opposed to what we're seeing in the core business on the transaction and loan losses, that's actually a result of increased risk pressures that we saw in the quarter as opposed to anything that we saw specific to credit. Lisa Ellis : Terrific, thanks. And then one real quick follow-up. You've mentioned that you've got some initiatives underway to drive use of the stored balances in PayPal, so meaning being able to deposit paychecks, et cetera. But it looked like the balance sheet line item there only grew about 6% year-on-year. So can you just give a little color around usage of stored balances in your initiatives there? Daniel Schulman : Yeah, first of all, Lisa, welcome to the coverage universe of us and glad to have you. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. In terms of additional funding sources, I think, is what you're talking about in there. We have not introduced additional funding sources coming in. You can now add cash into your balance at several thousand retail stores across the U.S. But this idea about us opening our platform up to more funding types to be more in the middle of how people manage and move their money is still a future initiative for us. So you wouldn't have seen that in today's results. John Rainey : Yeah. And with respect to the customer balances, Lisa, recall that in my prepared remarks I suggested that we moved $800 million from our customer balances to our cash to help fund some of the European originated credit. Lisa Ellis : Yeah. Yes. I got that. I was looking actually at the liabilities line item. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Thank you, Lisa. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Andrea, we have time for one last question. Operator : All right. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Congrats on the good, solid results here. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Bryan. Bryan Keane : I just want to go back to the whole question around funding mix since that's a popular one. You guys did mention that there's not a lot of difference between ACH and debit, although to us, we think of ACH as being only $0.02 and debit being a little north of $0.21. So just exactly what do you mean on that? On a funding mix change there, wouldn't there be an extra cost? And then secondly, on credit, there is a worry that if there is more transactions on the network's credit cards that you will make zero money or less money, obviously, if you open it up to consumer choice. Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. So we've done \u2013 as I mentioned, we've done a ton of experimentation on this and what we have seen with consumer choice is a much better experience for consumers, much more engagement, much more conversion and many more incremental net adds to that. And on the mix, when you look at ACH you also need to look into not just the cost of ACH, but when we take from an ACH balance, there's risk associated with that. And so as we look at the environment and we look at the differences in mix shift, we look at the advantages of choice, we look at the partnering with the ecosystem, we think this is a net positive not just for us but for other players in the ecosystem as well. And that's what has us cautiously optimistic about this. Any time that you can find solutions that actually provide a win for all players in the system, that's a real positive. And I think that's what we're finding in our conversations. It doesn't mean that things lead to one thing or another but it does mean that there's a lot more understanding and a lot more commonality in what we're trying to do than before. Bryan Keane : Okay. And since I'm the last one to ask a question, let me ask the follow-up on just PayPal's new mobile app. What's the change in value proposition for PayPal in-store for both merchants and consumers? Because obviously you guys sound excited about that, and it looks like PayPal in-store could be a big part of this. Thanks so much. Daniel Schulman : Yeah, you bet. Well, first of all, the mobile app is a fundamentally redesigned app. It really brings us into the mobile world. It puts up front the things that customers want to go out and do, it doesn't clutter it up. It's simple, easy. As I mentioned, it's driving increased consumer engagement. And it also enables us for consumers to now be able to use their mobile phone in-store whether that be through NFC or QR codes. And the way that I think about in-store is really in-store, online, in-app, they're all coming together. It's just commerce is the way to think about it. It's all moving towards mobile. And we basically want to be able to utilize for merchants this underlying platform so that we can be their OS, do 100% share of checkout, enable merchants to create their own application, tie in their rewards into our platform, do things like split tender at checkout and create a real value proposition change for consumers so that merchants can use mobile to get closer to their customers. And we're trying to power that experience there. We want to be OS agnostic. We want to be POS, point-of-sale, agnostic as well. And then we want to use our PayPal wallet, which, as we mentioned now, is growing quite quickly to basically light up that merchant app. Part of the issue with merchant apps is when they can create a good value proposition, they need somebody to help power that. But then they need volume on that application. And with things like our One Touch technology, our new re-platforming, as long as a consumer opts in, we can credentialize their IDs and make that signing up for that app much more friction-free than previously. And so not only can we provide the underlying infrastructure for that merchant, but we can then light up that application with our consumer base. We've had great success with Shell in the U.K. They're doing a trial now in Brazil with Subway, with Burger King, with Dollar General, with Macy's, with Papa John's. We have thousands of retailers that now are part of our order-ahead application on our mobile app where you can just order ahead, pay with PayPal and then pick up in store. And so this is what I mean. Basically you have mobile, bridging the gap between online, in-app and in-store and we're really pleased with the initial results, it's obviously early on but a lot of potential for us there. So thank you for that question. Bryan Keane : Thank you for that color. Daniel Schulman : And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your time. Operator : And this concludes today's Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi Bill Carcache - Nomura Presentation : Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Keith [ph]. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holding's earnings release conference call for the second quarter of 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO, and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the Company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our Company's performance including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, July 21, 2016. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance, and in many cases exceeded our own expectations. And of course we announced earlier a multiyear partnership with Visa. But before I discuss our results, I'd like to point out that it's been one year since PayPal became a publicly traded company for the second time. In many ways, our listing last year was a full circle moment for PayPal. It allowed us to return to the core mission of our founders, the mission they were pursuing when they took PayPal public in 2002. Even with the Internet in its infancy, they saw the opportunity for technology to democratize money. Today our purpose is the same, but our opportunity is much greater, with the digitization of money accelerating and the adoption of mobile devices continuing its rapid pace globally. PayPal's total addressable market has grown to include all of digital commerce and digital money, a $100 trillion opportunity. Today's announcement with Visa brings us closer to capitalizing on that opportunity. The mission of PayPal is clear. We're striving to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers. And for our merchants, we want to provide a full service solution and platform that enables digital commerce. We were making tangible and consistent progress towards achieving these twin goals, while consistently delivering strong financial performance. I'm proud that Q2 was another strong quarter for PayPal, both financially and strategically. Our partnership with Visa will help drive consumer choice and provide enhanced value to the larger payment ecosystem. But first let's look at the financial metrics we delivered this quarter. We grew revenue at 19.5%, delivering $2.65 billion on the top line. Given the challenging comps from Q2 last year, this exceeded our internal forecasts and guidance. We processed $86.2 billion in total payment volume, an increase of 29%. And our merchant services volume expanded 36%. Our mobile payments volumes continued to accelerate, up 56% this quarter, accelerating for the third straight quarter. And we hit a record of over $24 billion in mobile TTV [ph] in the quarter. In the last 12 months we've added 19 million net active accounts, finishing the quarter with 188 million customer accounts transacting on the PayPal platform. And even as we add new active accounts, our transactions per account continue to expand, reaching 29 this quarter, up from 26 a year ago. We generated $495 million of free cash flow in the quarter, giving our business tremendous flexibility to continue to reinvest in our growth. In the first six months of 2016 we produced $1.1 billion of free cash flow, on track to meet our guidance of more than $2.1 billion for the year. And finally, we delivered $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS versus our guidance of $0.34 to $0.36. I'm proud of the PayPal team and they work hard to deliver these strong results. I'd like to now spend some time talking about the partnership announcement we made today with Visa and the progress we are making towards enabling our strategy of being a true customer champion. Being a customer champion company is not just words for us. In order to be a great company over the long term, we need to provide the very best experience for our customers. We believe that means giving our customers full choice and optionality in where they want to pay and how they want to pay. This change in our business model positions us to better serve our customers and is fundamental to the long-term growth and success of PayPal. While we expect this to drive incremental expense, we now have evidence to support the assertion that customer choice will benefit both our business model and our customers' over the medium term. Our improved onboarding experience, which we began rolling out last quarter, gives customers more choice when opening a PayPal account and has already resulted in lifting our activations. In the coming quarters we will be rolling out account setting and check-out experiences that also deliver enhanced customer choice. We believe these new experiences will result in improved engagement and a reduction in customer churn, all very good things for both our customers and for PayPal. But we are already seeing another significant benefit. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are opening up new opportunities for partnerships within our ecosystem. Today PayPal and Visa announced a strategic partnership to further expand our longstanding relationship. This agreement will allow both companies to offer greater choice to merchants and consumers and increase value to Visa issuers and PayPal customers. The benefits of this partnership include our ability to gain access to Visa's tokenization services, starting in the United States, for instore PayPal transactions. This will allow customers to pay with their Visa instruments and the PayPal wallet at the millions of retail locations where they see the Visa contactless logo. Importantly, retailers can expect to pay fees that are consistent with other contactless transactions they accept today. We will provide greater accessibility for Visa payment instruments and the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal will also provide Visa, their issuers and their cardholders additional visibility into each Visa funded transaction, providing greater transparency and enhancing payment system security. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty and removes the threat of any targeted pricing actions. This deal has the potential to be transformative for PayPal, Visa and the industry. We believe it provides us the flexibility and the capabilities to execute against our customer champion vision, to partner with issuers and others who share our vision, and to accelerate PayPal's instore access in new and profitable ways. We also believe it provides more options for growth and the ability to partner with others to mutually cross-sell our various current and projected services to consumers and merchants around the world. All of these will take some time to come to fruition, but this agreement opens up a new chapter for PayPal. Giving customers choice in how and where they want to pay provides a pathway over the long term from our goal of two transactions a week from our current engagement of just over two per month. It's also important to say that we welcome the opportunity to work with more partners like Visa to share our vision and we are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem. This is a new PayPal, one that is actively partnering across the digital payments landscape. For example, in the quarter, we also expanded the European rollout of the Vodafone Wallet we talked about last quarter. Consumers in Spain and Italy can now tap-and-pay in stores with PayPal and Visa, another example of how PayPal is opening our platform to a slew of new partnerships. Our partnership with Facebook continues to expand, as do our efforts with Google, Pinterest, Alibaba and eBay. I'm pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute through the back half of the year. We need to continually innovate and deepen customer engagement in order to maintain and further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q2 saw a significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the PayPal platform. We are making steady strides in our efforts to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers. In the second quarter, transactions per account increased to 29, and we processed 1.4 billion transactions, a new milestone for PayPal and an increase of 25% from the same period last year. Deepening consumer engagement is no accident. It is driven by our innovative products and an increasingly robust platform, designed with our customers and their needs in mind. Our aim is to deliver transformative products that make payments easier, faster, more reliable and more secure, online, in mobile, in app, and in store. One Touch, our contextual commerce services, Venmo, and Xoom are all perfect examples of this. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history. As of the second quarter, over 25 million consumers have opted in to One Touch, and I'm pleased to say that we now have over 2 million merchants offering this innovative way to pay. With a market-leading 87% conversion rate, we continue to see increased engagement and conversion with the use of One Touch. We are continuing to invest and innovate in contextual commerce. Last year Pinterest launched its first foray into buyable buttons. Braintree powers 80% of the Pinterest launch merchants. Building on this infrastructure, we are now powering Pinterest's new shopping bag functionality that lets shoppers pick items from across the web, collect them in a shopping cart, and make a single purchase. This brings over 10 million unique products to pinners for even richer and more convenient in-context shopping experience. And Venmo continues its rapid growth. In the quarter, Venmo processed some of $4 billion in P2P payments, an increase of 141% year over year. We are very focused in making steady progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. We've added eight more next-generation apps, beyond Munchery and Gametime. These include Parking Panda, Priv [ph], Wish [ph], Box [ph], App Market [ph] and Pashmark [ph]. We have also further expanded the Venmo pilot from 1 million to 3.5 million Venmo users. We expect to add many more merchants and all of the Venmo consumer base later this year. Xoom's U.S. customers can now send money to loved ones in 53 countries, and it continues to redefine global remittances through mobile technology, ending the quarter with more than 70% of transactions originating on a mobile device. We continue to see the benefits of our integration efforts, with Xoom adding more than double the number of net new actives this quarter versus a year ago. I'm pleased to say we're executing on how to position business case, and I have high hopes what Xoom can offer to PayPal consumers in the years ahead. All of these innovative new experiences are driving PayPal's leadership in mobile payments. As I mentioned, PayPal processed over $24 billion on mobile payment volume, an increase of 56% year over year, and mobile now represents 28% of our total payment volume, up from 26% in the first quarter. Mobile is arguably the most competitive arena in the digital payment's ecosystem, and PayPal continues to widen its lead and gain share. Two quarters ago we grew our mobile volumes 45% year over year, last quarter 54%. And despite a substantially increased base of mobile transactions, we grew 56% this quarter. We also continue to make substantial progress in acquiring new merchants and now have more than 14.5 million merchants transacting on our platform. An increasing ability to provide a suite of innovative services for merchants is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to be seen as a true full services MS partner. PayPal's merchant services payment volume was $71.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 36%. Leading merchants continue to choose PayPal, including Ikea in multiple countries, the world's leading cruise brands of Carnival Corporation, including Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland American Line, and Seaborne. Russia's Vkontakte, Europe's largest social media network with 360 million users. Women's fashion brand Talbot's. Cathay Pacific. And Evenbrite, the world's largest self-service ticketing platform, has now launched with Braintree full-step processing. And Braintree continues to gain momentum, rapidly adding new merchants, ending the quarter with 309 million cards on file, an increase of 101% from the same period a year ago. Finally, PayPal working continues to be an important way we engage our small business merchants and support their growth. In Q2 we exceeded 2 billion in originations since our launch. We've now funded more than 90,000 small business merchants in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Our working capital merchants see an almost $0.50 increase in payment volume for every dollar of working capital expended to them by PayPal, clearly a powerful tool for our merchants. Finally, I'd like to mention a few accolades we've recently received at Highlight, the strong progress we've made in the past year as an independent company. First, our financial performance has earned us a place on the Fortune500 list at number 307. Importantly, we are now being recognized for our leadership in innovation. Recently, InformationWeek named PayPal the number 11th company in the country in terms of technology innovation. And the value of our brand is also on the rise. The Financial Times recently came out with the BrandZ listing of the top 100 most valuable global brands. PayPal was one of the top 10 brands that increased its value most in 2016, gaining 35% and rising from number 88 to the 65th most valuable brand across the globe. And finally, and perhaps most meaningfully to many of us, consumers in the United States recently ranked 180 top brands across the world in terms of social impact and doing the most good in the world. PayPal was ranked among the top five companies across the globe. We've made strong progress in the 12 months since becoming public. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but the opportunities are coming into sharper focus and are now clearly within our reach. We remain focused on executing with both discipline and excellence for our customers and for our shareholders. I'd like to now turn the call over to John. John? John Rainey : I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goals of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strengthened our position in the ecosystem, enhanced our value proposition as a customer champion company. First I will walk you through the highlights of our second quarter results. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume was $86.2 billion, an increase of 29%. U.S. payment volume grew 27% and international volume grew 21%. Our merchant services business grew 36%, demonstrating that our strategy of being a customer champion and moving from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes continues to gain transaction. We ended the quarter with 188 million active accounts, an 11% increase from a year ago. Account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal Afford [ph] offering, followed by Venmo. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 29, up 13% year over year, and an acceleration from the first quarter. This, when combined with the increase in active accounts, contributed to payment transaction growth of 25% year over year. In the second quarter we generated revenue of $2.65 billion, up 19.5% on a currency-neutral basis and 15.6% on a spot basis. Q2 revenue exceeded our expectations as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. In the second quarter we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons from the amendment of our Synchrony co-branded credit card agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables portfolio last year, as well as the larger currency hedging gains in Q2 '15. We are pleased with our very strong top-line performance and our ability to offset these year-over-year pressures. Transaction revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter. Performance was driven by large merchant growth in our core business and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.69% for the second quarter, a decline of 22 basis points year over year. The decline was primarily driven by lower currency hedging revenue in the quarter versus last year, the growth of our P2P business, including Venmo, and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants. Revenue from other value-added services was flat versus last year, driven by the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables in Q2 of last year, offset by solid results from our credit products. Transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, our volume-based expenses, increased 28%, in line with total payment volume growth. This resulted in a transaction margin of 59.8% versus 63.8% in Q2 '15. In the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the transaction margin decline was driven primarily by strong performance by Braintree, which has a lower take rate and higher transaction expense, the lapping of the amendment to Synchrony agreement, and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables, and the high-margin hedge revenue we recognized in Q2 '15. Other expenses grew 10%, well below revenue growth, and drove 185 basis points of leverage. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other expenses increased approximately 7%, demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on strong expense discipline. The scale of our platform allows us to carefully manage the growth of these other expenses, even as our revenue grew nearly 20% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to see opportunity to manage these costs over time. We delivered operating income of $528 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2016, operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion. Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.9%, a decline from last year, predominantly driven by the items I already mentioned affecting revenue : the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables, both of which dropped directly to the bottom line. We were also impacted by the acquisition of Xoom, which was approximately 40 basis points. But excluding these items, operating margin would have expanded approximately 100 basis points year over year. We generated non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share for the quarter, the top end of our guidance range. For the first half of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.73. Second quarter capital expenditures were $201 million or approximately 8% of revenue. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $495 million, representing $0.19 of free cash flow for ever dollar of revenue. During the quarter we also returned approximately $300 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 8 million shares. Year to date we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders, repurchasing 25 million shares at an average price of $36.34. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. I want to take a few -- make a few comments regarding the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. First, we should acknowledge that we are in the very early days, and exactly what happens from here will take some time to unfold. Europe generally, and the U.K. specifically, are very important parts of our business that we will continue to serve. In the second quarter, approximately 12% of our revenue was generated in the U.K. Because of the global nature of our business, we typically see a counterbalance effect when any one currency measurably weakens or strengthens. This is particularly pronounced in certain corridors like the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and the E.U. due to proximity and consumers' awareness of currency shifts. In the medium term we're obviously going to keep a close eye on the broader economic environment and any effect on customer behavior. From a foreign currency standpoint, the euro and the pound are the two currencies where we have the most exposure. For that reasons, we hedged both currencies and our exposure from a translation perspective in 2016 is minimal. Importantly, our E.U. business is operated through our Luxembourg bank where we are allowed to passport our banking license among the E.U. member states. The U.K.'s decision to exit the E.U. will have some impact on the regulatory framework under which we operate. We have been assessing the ramifications of a Leave vote since the referendum was announced, and once we have better clarity on how the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. with respect to financial services will be governed, we will take the necessary steps to be able to continue to serve our customers in the capacity that we do today. Now I'd like to give you an update on our credit portfolio. Our credit products support and complement our platform, enhancing our digital payments offering for both our consumers and our merchants. Credit drives a positive network effect for our business, increasing volume and engagement on our platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of our TPV, and in the medium term, we expect the TPV contribution from our credit products to remain around this level. In addition, as we've said previously, we continue to assess asset-light strategies to fund and grow our credit offering. The performance of our credit portfolio continues to be in line with our expectations. In the second quarter we saw improvement in our delinquency rates and most of our other credit quality metrics. We have, however, experienced a higher percentage of our late-stage delinquent consumer credit balances rolling to charge-off. This has resulted in a charge-off rate of 6.3% versus 6.1% last quarter. We attribute the increased charge-off to changes in our own collection efforts that were recently instituted. We've taken steps to address this impact on the back half of this year. As Dan mentioned, our agreement with Visa, and more broadly, our strategic decision to invest in customer choice, is a great opportunity for our customers, our shareholders and other partners in the payment ecosystem. This partnership will help drive the digitization of payments both in mobile and in store. Much has been made about the blurring of the offline and online world through digital payments. The agreement with Visa is an important step allowing us to more fully participate in this powerful secular shift with our mobile-first strategy, complemented by Visa's instore strengths. We have an expansive vision for PayPal, including being an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. Customer choice, as we refer to it, involves empowering our customers to use PayPal where they want to pay and how they want to pay, and is the vehicle for achieving that vision. For the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate any material impact to our results from the movement to choice. Beginning next year we expect changes to our funding mix from customer choice will increase transaction expense. But at the same time, we believe expanding customer choice will unlock future revenue opportunities. Moving to customer choice and our agreement with Visa lay the foundation for sustainable revenue growth, with more certainty in our cost structure. It's very early on and we're only six months through the year. As we get closer to yearend, we will provide more detail on the impacts of this and how it affects our 2017 performance. Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year across our core business, Braintree and P2P, in addition to our growing mobile penetration further validates our strategies and our business priorities. As a result, we are raising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion, or 19% to 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We are also narrowing the non-GAAP earnings range to $1.47 to $1.50 per share, representing growth of 18% at the high end of the range. And we are reaffirming our full year 2016 guidance on free cash flow, CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.6 to $2.67 billion, or 19% to 21% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share. In conclusion, our second quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we are making in our business. Revenue is strong and we are combining that with excellent cost control to generate healthy margins and strong free cash flow. We continue to allocate capital in a way that generates shareholder value. And our partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business, giving us greater cost certainty going forward, allowing us to profitably participate in the offline market, and creating the foundation for being a customer champion. With that I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your question please. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on the Visa deal. I was curious, can we still rely upon your midterm guidance after considering the Visa partnership? I know there's a lot of moving pieces obviously, but curious if the midterm guidance still applies. John Rainey : Thanks, Tien-tsin, appreciate it. This is John. We'll update that, if it's appropriate, as we get closer to the yearend. Like I suggested in my prepared remarks, we're very early on into this. We're very encouraged by the agreement. We think it's a fantastic opportunity for PayPal. And it's likely to positively affect the way our financial outlook and for the future. But we're not prepared to update that at this time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. On the part of the Visa agreement around contactless payments and the enablement of offline acceptance, can you give us a sense of what the process is going to look like for that? Visa mentioned on their call that you still have to get sort of approval from the financial institutions, from the merchants. How do you intend to kind of get more out of this enablement than we saw out of the Discover deal and what's the roadmap look like to get there, you know, particularly from a timing perspective? Dan Schulman : Hey, Heath, it's Dan. Thanks for your question. So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there's alignment for everyone. And we believe that we've designed an agreement that works for PayPal, Visa and the issuers. We've been in discussions with issuers, Visa has been in discussion with its issuers, and they're excited about the benefit from the volumes that we can bring to them and that we can bring to point of sale. And as Charlie pointed out, this agreement removes many of the concerns, if not all of the concerns, that issuers and others in the ecosystem have about working with PayPal. You know, choice is something that everybody has been talking about. What issuers want, what we want, is the ability for a consumer to make a choice, to have options as to what payment tender type they want to pay with. What that basically means is that, you know, a consumer could pay with their credit, with ACAs, with debit, with cash, with P2P, with PayPal credit, any of those, but it's the option of the consumer to make that choice. And then when you add on top of that optionality, the fact that we are very willing and happy to share the same sorts of data that somebody would get with a typical credit card swipe back to the network, back to the issuers and to customers, that's exactly what issuers have been asking for. We actually think that this deal that we have with Visa offers a couple of benefits. Obviously it offers access to tokens at rates that are comparable to other contactless methods out there, and so we can compete with anybody now at a point of sale, there's no competitive disadvantage to anybody else out there. And we can go offline profitably. Second, we get fee certainty, as we talked about, no targeted actions against PayPal, limits our new fees, even industry-based fees and volume-based discounts. So we have certainty around our cost structure. And very importantly, I think this opens us up to new partnerships : new partnerships with issuers, networks and others. Choice and data turn us into their friends. And when I think about the partnerships that we have, we're an ideal distribution mechanism to drive more online and mobile spend to issuers. They're an idea partner to drive incremental net adds in customers into the PayPal platform. That's a win-win for both of us. And this is going to open up a new chapter for PayPal to partner with and for all of us to work together to advance digital payments going forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks and John mentioned, a choice also is going to help us drive incremental new net adds. We're already seeing that in some of the changes we've made to our onboarding. When you look at One Touch and you see what our customers do when they're able to default a payment mechanism, their engagement goes up, the conversion rates go up. And obviously, when a customer gets to choose what instrument they want, we're going to see less calls come into customer care for us, we're going to see customer satisfaction go up. And typically when that happens, customer churn goes down. So we think this is a very strong agreement that benefits Visa, its issuers, and us, allows us to work within the ecosystem. And the issuers don't need to sign any unique agreements with us. It's simply an opt in to participate with us. It's no additional work from them. And our movement to choice, data sharing, plus our commitment to quality, I think puts us on a par with others that are using Visa tokens in the ecosystem. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks, Dan. Dan Schulman : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis - Bernstein: Hi guys. Good afternoon. So, one just follow-up question then on the Visa arrangements around activating at the point of sale, how -- in that scenario, do you guys remain the merchant of record? And does it flow over your acquiring platform? Or is the construct more of a pass-through wallet, as that's envisioned? Dan Schulman : For the point of sale, we would do kind of pass-through on the token level, so that there'd be transparency on that. We've always said that we are perfectly willing to use the industry tokens and do that on a pass-through basis. And this agreement allows us to do that. It allows us, one, to approach merchants with rates that are comparable to any digital wallets that are out there, so this whole card not present/card present rate structure that people have talked about, this takes away that concern as well. So it's an agreement that our two teams spent a lot of time working with, a lot of time making sure that the issuer population was also comfortable with it. And we think it is a, really, a tremendous win for all the parties on that. Lisa Ellis - Bernstein: Got it. And on those transactions, sorry, just to clarify though, it's still processing over your acquiring platform? Dan Schulman : It is, yes. Lisa Ellis - Bernstein: Right? Meaning like the merchant will be paying you directly their typical take rate. Dan Schulman : That's correct. Lisa Ellis - Bernstein: Okay. Okay. Terrific. Thanks guys. Dan Schulman : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your question please. James Friedman - Susquehanna: Hi. I was going to pivot out of the Visa conversation and ask you about Braintree. I think in the past, Dan, you've disclosed, or discussed at least, some of the backlog in Braintree. I was wondering if you could update us in fact quantitatively, what does it take to actually active the merchant from the backlog from a Braintree perspective? Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yeah. So we're making very good progress in terms of our ability to work through the large demand that we have for Braintree. In effect, we try to make it as easy as possible on a merchant. We have ADI sets [ph] that makes it easy to integrate. It really depends on the extent of the integration that we're doing in any of the customization [ph] that we have to do. But I'd say we're making really good progress on keeping up with the demand. Right now the demand is strong, as John mentioned. That's why we're -- part of the reason why we're taking up our revenue forecast. But I'm really pleased with our ability now to onboard these customers and bring them live, to say [ph]. James Friedman - Susquehanna: Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yup. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is open. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. I was wondering if you can give us a rough sense how much of TPV now goes through the Visa network both on a credit and debit perspective? And I just want to be clear, there is no initial incentive that is going to be provided to that volume starting day one, right? You'll have to go negotiate that with the issuers. Dan Schulman : We have volume-based incentives from Visa themselves. There are also other potential terms that we could do with issuers specifically. Your first question was? John Rainey : How much volume is on Visa. Dan Schulman : Yeah. John Rainey : And that's not something we'll disclose, but maybe, George, a construct or a framework to kind of think about this, because I understand why you're asking the question. If you consider we have just rough order of magnitude $300 billion of TPV today, and if you were to look at funding shift on that, that would overstate the effect of funding shift, because this agreement for now is U.S.-only, and as we've disclosed in the past, that's roughly half of our TPV. We also see differences in funding mix between P2P versus goods and services, so you've got to strip that out or at least treat that differently. And we disclosed earlier this year that P2P is roughly $40 billion of our annual TPV. And then lastly, you need to also consider that there's a large percentage of our customers today that only have a card in the wallet. So, choice for them, there'd be no other increase in cost by moving -- by adding additional card or doing a different card. So from the cost side, that's the right framework to think about this. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.: Okay. That's very helpful. Dan Schulman : I'd also add to it, George, that, remember, this is about optionality. So, all tender types will be presented to the customer, present to choose the tender type that makes the most sense for them for that particular purchase. And we've seen that that is a beneficial thing when we offer customers that ability. John Rainey : Yeah. Even the early stages of testing some of these experiences with customers, we see really encouraging signs just in things like customer activation where you remove some of the friction from that process. And as Dan alluded to earlier, One Touch has been a great testbed for us as we've seen pretty dramatic increases in engagement after someone activates there. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.: Okay, great. Just a quick follow-up. John, I think you talked about taking some steps on the PayPal credit side to maybe mitigate some of the increases that you've seen in charge-offs. Can you elaborate on that, what that might mean for the back half of the year? John Rainey : Sure. So as Dan talked about on the call last quarter, since we've become an independent company, we've really tried to establish ourselves as at least aspiring to be best in class when it comes to compliance. We think that that's really important for us. That's part of being a customer champion. And so we've taken steps across every aspect of our business to improve our compliance. And so, specifically, we changed some of the ways that both we contacted customers as well as the repayment options for credit. That had some effect that on the late-stage delinquencies. There are other methods that we can do to mitigate that impact and we're going ourselves with those options for the back half of the year. Dan Schulman : And I'd also just say, John mentioned, we're seeing some improvements in the underlying credit quality of our base, delinquency write-offs on that. So it's just that one particular bucket that we saw an increase, and so we're taking actions to address that. But in terms of the overall portfolio, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing on that. John Rainey : Yeah. If I can just add maybe a little bit more color to that, our total delinquencies were actually down year over year. When we look at the percentage of our portfolio that's rated prime or above, that grew by a point, a better credit quality year over year. The 90-day delinquency is down year over year. And our portfolio of FICO store is relatively flat with where it's been. So it's -- look, we're very keen on all the concern around this, with other players in the ecosystem, and we're aware of that. So it's something that we're hyper-focused on. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.: Okay, great. Really appreciate the color. Dan Schulman : Yeah. You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi: Thank you. Good afternoon, Dan and John. Congratulations on getting the deal. Two separate questions. On the Visa-related customer choice, when you say no impact in 2016, is that indicative of your view as to how long it might take to implement specific deals with issuers? I guess that's the first question. And the second is with regards to, how does the agreement affect your relationship with merchants, and I guess your weighted average funding cost is an important part of the discussion but not the only factor. If you could comment on those. Dan Schulman : So in terms of our guidance for 2016, incorporates any impact that there might be from customer choice. But you're right that this takes some time for this to be implemented and to move forward. So our guidance incorporates any impact that there might be from customer choice. And as John mentioned, we will wait until we get closer to 2017 to give 2017 guidance. First of all, obviously we'll take a look at consumer behavior as a result of this. There are a number of discussions going on in the ecosystem and we want to look at the totality of the landscape before we really talk about what 2017 could look like. And finally, we're halfway through the year, we got a full another six months to execute against and let's see how our momentum takes us before we provide 2017 guidance. And on the merchant side, merchants have been working with us quite closely as we're creating a platform for them to take advantage of digital commerce. And that basically means letting a merchant write their own application. And we power that application through a platform that enables them to extend our value proposition to their customers online, on the mobile, and instore. And part of that instore environment, when it comes to the takeout wallet, we did not have tokenization schema, we've used different swarms of that. And so from a merchant perspective, the rates now that we can offer on an instore point of sale transaction are significantly more competitive for them. So it just strengthens our position in terms of working with merchants. No change in our strategy, but certainly strengthens it and opens up a wide opportunity for us. As we talk about the blurring of online and offline coming together, this really opens up our ability to move into any context, whether it be online, in app or instore with our digital wallet. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi: Okay. I guess a quick follow-up if I may. In terms of the online choice, how is Paydiant affected by this, if it is? Dan Schulman : Yeah, great question. Paydiant impact. Paydiant is part of our fundamental underlying platform. So when you think about the piece parts that we've started to put together, we had PayPal that was obviously very strong and online market. Braintree extremely strong in the mobile and in app marketplace. And Paydiant, very strong in the instore environment. And so all of those are now coming together and being integrated, so that we can offer merchants the ability to look across any of those contexts and use our platform to power and enable their move to digital commerce. Then what we've done obviously is, because our base is so large, we take our branded PayPal wallet, which now available to go into more context, as I've just mentioned, and write up those applications, because we have so many subscribers that we can bring to those merchants. And so you've got a platform play that's really unbranded, that supports a merchant's move into digital commerce, and then a branded wallet. And this helps us with our branded wallet to move into that offline space. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi: That's great. Thank you for that explanation. Dan Schulman : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes, we do, sir. That question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is open, sir. Bill Carcache - Nomura: Thank you. Dan, there are some skepticism regarding the willingness of issuers to promote PayPal. Could you speak to what you think will lead issuers to want to promote their brands on PayPal during the exclusivity period? And maybe give a little more color on what the receptivity has been in your discussions with the large issuers. And finally, what your confidence level is that you'll be able to get some of them onboard. Dan Schulman : Yup. So we have a high degree of confidence in that we haven't worked this agreement in a vacuum, nor has Visa worked it in a vacuum. We've obviously been working with the issuer community. We've obviously been very close communications with them. We've been in close communications actually throughout the whole payment ecosystem with quite a number of players. And this move towards choice, our ability to open up our data, is something that issuers have been asking us for for quite some time. I think they are, based on our conversations, conversations that Visa has had with its own issuers, and we've been a part of some of those, there's a lot of excitement about the ability to partner and work together. We think we could be a very strong distribution channel for them. You've talked about that in some of your write-ups, and that's exactly the vision that we are moving towards, and we have a good degree of confidence around that. Bill Carcache - Nomura: Thank you. If I may, a follow-up for John. John, I believe that you made the point at Investor Day that the increase in your transaction expense rate from the shift to consumer choice would be something that you could offset with the operating leverage inherent in the business. Given the partnership announcement and all of the different aspects to it, I guess you guys are saying tonight that that doesn't necessarily still hold, you'll reevaluate over the next couple of quarters when you give 2017 guidance, say whether that's still the case. Or just trying to get a sense of I guess applicability of that statement still. John Rainey : Yeah. So, yeah, that's not entirely correct, but just talking directionally, we have -- I would describe this as very analogous still to like an investment that one would make, an acquisition for example, where there's perhaps an upfront cost but there's a revenue stream that more than offsets that to where it's very accretive to the business. With respect to the increase in transaction expense, we'll give more specific guidance as we get towards the end of the year about 2017. But when you look at both the revenue benefit as well as the good demonstrated cost control that you've seen for several quarters now, just look at the over 180 basis points of leverage this quarter, the fact that our operating expenses, if you normalize for the Xoom acquisition, only went up 7% in the quarter, we continue to demonstrate that we have a laser focused on discipline here, while still not starving the business for investment as well. We're making sure that we're continuing to invest organically. So all that in combination gives us a level of comfort with this, that it's absolutely the right thing to do for the business. But specific to 2017, we'll give you a heads-up on that towards yearend. Bill Carcache - Nomura: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. John Rainey : You bet. Dan Schulman : Thank you. Dan Schulman : Okay. Thank you everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time, and, operator, that will conclude our Q&A session. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great evening.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to PayPal\u2019s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Scheibe Rabinovitch : Thank you, Esther. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet. And both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full-year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company\u2019s performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these none-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full-year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017 and the next three years. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, October 20, 2016. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle. I\u2019m pleased to say that PayPal delivered another quarter of strong results. We made significant strides in the quarter, forging new partnerships and delivering continued innovation to our customers. We feel well-positioned for future growth and profitability. I\u2019ll start my remarks with our financial performance. In the quarter, we reported $0.35 of non-GAAP EPS, at the high-end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.33 to $0.35. We delivered $2.67 billion in revenues, an increase of 21% over last year on an FX neutral basis. And we generated $618 million in free cash flow. We increased the number of active customers and accelerated their engagement on the PayPal platform. We finished the quarter with 192 million active customer accounts, adding 19 million new accounts in the past 12 months. And transaction per account continued to increase, reaching 30 for the first time, up from 27 a year ago. In the quarter, PayPal processed over $87 billion in total payment volume, up 28% over last year on an FX neutral basis. These results reinforce our belief that the opportunities for PayPal to grow and gain share have never been greater. We are executing against our strategic plan with intensity and speed. And we are committed to seizing the opportunities in front of us by truly embracing the mantle of Customer Champion. Being a customer champion means always prioritizing the needs of our customers. It means continually reexamining our business to improve the customer experience on our platform, and to provide real differentiated value to both consumers and merchants. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are creating a significantly better customer experience to accelerate adoption and drive engagement. In the quarter, we made meaningful progress in offering customer choice in our online and mobile checkout and in our P2P experiences. These have enhanced our customers in the U.S. can send money, shop and pay with PayPal. Our customers are now able to set their preferred funding type in their PayPal Wallet to sources other than their PayPal balance. This gives customers the option to default to their favorite debit card, bank account or credit card, and we\u2019ve seen a corresponding increase in engagement. And as we have demonstrated over the past several months, customer choice is also allowing us to forge valuable new strategic partnerships across the ecosystem. Since our announced agreement with Visa, we have also entered into a strategic partnership with MasterCard, which offers consumers greater choice and flexibility to manage or move their money. It ensures that MasterCard cardholders can easily identify and choose MasterCard within the PayPal Wallet. Our joint U.S. customers will be able to use their tokenization services to make in-store purchases at MasterCard\u2019s Contactless enabled merchant locations around the world. And along with our agreement with Visa, the deal with MasterCard exempts PayPal from current or future digital wallet fees and provides cost certainty for years to come. Thanks to our agreements with Visa and MasterCard, PayPal now has a seamless, quick and simple way to activate PayPal payments at the point of sale. Our agreements with payment networks are opening the doors to deeper and more engaged conversations with a host of financial institutions about how to drive incremental spend for their brands and better more innovative experiences for our mutual customers. These conversations have been very positive and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in partnering with issuers. We also are significantly extending our previous agreements with Alibaba. We just launched the first stages of becoming a payment option on Alibaba\u2019s global retail marketplace, AliExpress. This partnership has the potential to drive meaningful cross-border traffic, as PayPal consumers outside of China shop on AliExpress merchants in China. And while we are excited by these new and expanded partnerships, we are equally pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with previously announced partners, such as Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil which is set to go live this quarter. We are working with Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil to help their more than 140 million customers in Mexico and Brazil manage and move money with their Telcel and Claro digital wallets powered by PayPal\u2019s platform. We also deepened our existing relationships with some of the world\u2019s leading technology companies, including Facebook and Apple. With Apple\u2019s new iOS 10 Venmo users with iPhone can now ask Siri to send and request money from friends, and also send P2P payments within the messages app. These new experiences make sending and receiving money even easier and increase the relevance of Venmo by introducing the service in more context than ever before. With each partnership agreement that we sign or extend, we further expand the ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand, and move closer towards our vision of becoming an everyday essential financial service for people around the world. We believe offering consumers choice in how they want to pay and where they want to pay is essential in becoming an everyday part of a customer\u2019s financial life. As we\u2019ve shared previously, the average Venmo user already interacts with the app more than two times per week. And we are beginning to see some additional proof-points that are strategy and partnerships are moving us towards our long-term engagement goals. For instance, our initial launch into Spain with Vodafone and Visa, which provides customers the chance to pay online, in app and in store is already generating over six in store transactions per month per active user. And the PayPal Vodafone service is now available in Italy and the UK. We also made a further announcement with Visa to include the integration of Visa Checkout into Braintree. Braintree also announced several other new payment options in Q3, including Apple Pay for web, MasterCard Masterpass, China UnionPay and PayPal Credit. Another way we\u2019re executing against our customer champion vision, despite being a true payments partner to our merchants, to help them succeed in an increasingly connected and mobile-centric world. Mobile technology continues to raise the line that divides online from offline and commerce is moving into entirely new context. PayPal helps merchants navigate disruptive environment and is increasingly the payments partner of choice to merchants of all sizes. We continue to move aggressively towards our goal of processing 100% share of checkout for merchants. This strategic focus enables PayPal to grow its market share during the quarter. Our Merchant Services payment volumes once again grew faster than the growth of e-commerce. Merchant Services payment volume grew to $73 billion in the third quarter, up 34% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. And PayPal also continued its strong growth in global payments. In the quarter, we processed $26 billion in mobile payments, up 56% over last year. Mobile continues to become an increasingly relevant part of our platform, now representing approximately 30% of our volume. We are on track to process well over $100 billion in mobile payment volume in the next 12 months. This is a remarkable achievement, considering we\u2019ve cumulatively processed some $200 billion in mobile volume over the past 10 years. Our growth online and in mobile is being driven by some of the world\u2019s top merchants choosing PayPal. These include the American Red Cross, which expanded their integration with PayPal to include our Mass Pay product. We also worked with the American Red Cross in the quarter to support flood relief efforts in Louisiana by waiving on the fees on the donations raised. H&M, the global fashion retailer, launched with PayPal as a payment option on its websites in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. Costco de Mexico became the first subsidiary of the global membership-only warehouse club to integrate PayPal as a payment method for its online store. Yandex Direct, the paid search platform for Yandex, Russia\u2019s most popular search engine went live with PayPal. And we expanded our relationship with Uber to make PayPal a way to pay for rides in Costa Rica, Panama, Columbia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil. Braintree also had numerous new merchants, including Six Flags and Eon [ph]. Being a customer champion demands constant innovation for our customers. As One Touch demonstrates, when you create truly transformative experiences you drive engagement. We now have more than 32 million consumers and more than 4 million merchants using One Touch. By the end of the year, we now expect 5 million merchant accounts. We are offering One Touch to approximately 36 million consumer accounts. Venmo continues to expand its reach and is becoming a daily part of the lives of mobile and social media connected consumers. In the quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in volume, an increase of 131% year-over-year. It is now just shy of a $20 billion annual run-rate. We are excited that Pay with Venmo is now generally available for all Venmo users and we are pleased that giving users a new way to use their Venmo account is resulting in increased engagement. Early data suggest that people who use Pay with Venmo are approximately 30% more engaged than other Venmo users. And we are now ready to more rapidly expand the number of merchants accepting Venmo as we exit 2016 and go into next year. Xoom is also driving significant innovation. Xoom recently added a new request feature, which allows remittances to become a two-way interaction between senders and receivers for the first time. Remittance recipients in 29 countries can now request funds, bill payments or mobile reloads from customers in the U.S. through the Xoom platform. Additionally, PayPal customers can now link their PayPal and Xoom accounts, giving customers access to their PayPal funding sources within Xoom. This will allow PayPal\u2019s U.S. customers to send funds to multiple new markets and get access to new services. As we shared at the time of the acquisition, cross-selling Xoom to our U.S. PayPal customers is a meaningful way to drive additional adoption and engagement with PayPal\u2019s 87 million active U.S. customers. And in the third quarter, Paydiant launched an exciting new mobile payment experience created for the Autogrill Group in Italy. Autogrill is the world\u2019s leading provider for food and beverage services for travelers, operating mainly in airports, on highways, and in railway stations. This international application of Paydiant\u2019s technology was made possible by PayPal\u2019s global reach and the integration of our platforms. Finally, the third quarter saw PayPal receive some remarkable industry recognition. Venmo was named as one of Interbrand\u2019s breakthrough brands in their 2016 ranking of 60 companies that are younger than 10-years-old that are driving significant change by creating new experiences for consumers. PayPal gained seven spots and increased its brand value by 14% on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking, making PayPal once again one of the 100 most valuable brands in the world. I\u2019m also pleased to announce that PayPal has been included on Fortune\u2019s 2016 Change the World list, a ranking of 50 companies that are doing well by doing good. This is a meaningful recognition for the PayPal team and we are very proud of achieving the number 19 spot on that list. And finally, Group XP, a part of WPP, named PayPal as one of the top three consumer experience brands in the world based on branding, design, content, online presence and user experience. The past six months have been historic ones for us. We have embarked on a course that enables us to become a true customer champion. We are partnering across multiple ecosystems from retailers to OEMs to wireless carriers, technology companies and with financial institutions and networks. We strongly believe that this positions us for long-term growth and profitability. Consequently, we are increasing our three-year outlook for revenue, the 16% to 17% FX neutral growth, in contrast to the 15% previously guided. We expect our free cash flow to grow in line with our revenue growth. And importantly, we believe our non-GAAP operating margin will be stable to growing. John will provide more detail on our outlook in his portion of the call. In the past two years, in the face of one competitive announcement after another we have attracted $35 million net new active accounts. Our engagement per active account has grown from 24 to 30 times per year. Our merchant base now totals $15 million active accounts. And our mobile payments\u2019 volumes and unique innovative capabilities continue to drive our growth. We believe the partnerships we have signed enable us clearly, predictably and profitably pursue the $100 trillion total addressable market that is fully but surely digitizing. I believe we now have the platform, capabilities, scale and partnerships to enable us to drive profitable growth, not just next year but over the medium and long term. And with that, let me turn the call to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal\u2019s customers and our employees worldwide for making us another great quarter. As Dan discussed in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering across the payments ecosystem to drive ubiquity. We enhanced our value proposition for both consumers and merchants and laid the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth across our platform. First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for our third quarter. On a currency neutral-basis, total payment volume increased 28% to $87 billion. U.S. payment volume grew 25% and international volume grew 30%. Our Merchant Services business grew 34% to $73 billion, primarily driven by core Braintree and Venmo. We ended the quarter with 192 million active accounts, adding 4.4 million active customer accounts in the quarter, and increasing our active accounts by 11% from the third quarter last year. Our core PayPal business, Venmo and Xoom, were strong contributors to account growth. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 30, up 13%. Increased engagement in conjunction with continued double-digit growth in active accounts resulted in payment transaction growth of 24% year-over-year. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.67 billion, up 21% on a currency neutral basis and 18% on a spot basis. Q3 revenue growth accelerated both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. Transaction revenue increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. Performance was driven by growth in our core business, in particular with larger merchants and strengthened the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take-rate of 2.65% for the third quarter. The 19 basis point decline was primarily driven by the growth of our P2P business and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants. Revenue from other value added services grew 28% versus last year, driven by growth in our credit products. In the quarter, transaction expense, and transaction and loan losses were $830 million and $271 million respectively. In the aggregate, these volume based expenses increased 29% resulting in a transaction margin of 58.7% versus 62.3% in Q3 2015. The transaction margin decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the mix shift in our business toward Braintree and increased provisions in our credit business, partially offset by Xoom. As we have discussed previously, in the third quarter we made investments to further drive customer acquisition and engagement and compliance efforts in corporate functions, which increased operating expenses in the quarter. Despite these investments, other operating expenses grew 13%, well below revenue growth and drove 200 basis points of leverage. To give you a bit more color on our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter, I will quickly run through the line items. Customer support and operations expense was $304 million. Sales and marketing expense was $212 million. Product development was $181 million. G&A cost were $229 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses were $150 million. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other operating expenses increased only 9% or approximately half the rate of revenue growth, once again demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on expense discipline and see significant opportunities to manage our other expense line items over time. In the third quarter, leverage in our other operating expenses partially offset the transaction margin decline, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.4% and non-GAAP operating income of $490 million. Our third quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.3% versus 17.7% in Q3 2015, due primarily to discrete tax items. Non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $0.35 for the quarter. Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 19% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $618 million, representing $0.23 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $183 million or approximately 7% of revenue. During the quarter, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 1.3 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $945 million to shareholders by repurchasing 26 million shares at an average price of $36.37. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. At the end of the third quarter, the total outstanding balances in our pool of consumer and merchant receivables were $4.5 billion and $581 million respectively. For our consumer portfolio, the principal charge-off rate in the quarter was 6%, and we\u2019ve recognized $114 million as the provision from loan losses. The balance amount of our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable is now $282 million. We\u2019ve frequently spoken about moving to an asset-light credit strategy. I\u2019m pleased to say that we recently signed a strategic partnership agreement with Latitude Financial Services to develop new consumer financing products for PayPal\u2019s customers in Australia. The relationship will leverage PayPal\u2019s strengths in technology but the receivables will be funded by Latitude. We\u2019ll share more on this, as well as a more comprehensive off-balance-sheet strategy as we move through 2017. As Dan mentioned, given the partnerships we\u2019ve established, the response we\u2019ve seen in our platforms at the initial rollout of our choice experiences and the ongoing momentum in our business, we are better positioned today to provide you with an updated three-year outlook as well as a framework for how to begin thinking about 2017. Over the next three years, we expect total payment volume growth of mid-20% on a currency neutral basis. We are raising our outlook for revenue growth to 16% to 17% on a currency neutral basis up from the 15% which we shared at Analyst Day in May of this year. We expect operating margins to be stable to growing on a non-GAAP basis. We also expect free cash flow to grow in line with revenue. Further, as we pursue a more asset-light credit strategy, we expect less of our free cash flow to be directed towards funding credit in the future. For 2017, we estimate our revenue growth to be in line with our updated three-year outlook or 16% to 17% on a currency neutral basis. We also expect that the incremental expense related to our customer choice initiatives will be offset by other revenue and cost initiatives, resulting in an operating margin consistent with full year 2016. More detailed guidance for 2017 will be provided when we report fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings. Finally, I would like to discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Year-to-date we have delivered strong performance and outstanding growth across our platform. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.78 billion, to $10.85 billion or 20% growth on a currency neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.50, representing growth of 18% at the high-end. We now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $2.2 billion. We are also reaffirming our prior year - prior full year 2016 guidance on CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.92 billion to $2.99 billion, or 16% to 19% growth on a currency neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share. In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver exceptional revenue growth and free cash flow, while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities across our other operating expenses. In addition, the cash flow generating power of this business gives us great flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline. We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world\u2019s leading digital payments platform for our customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. John, do you have concerns about the performance of the credit portfolio? And can you provide any more detail on how you are feeling about the credit business short-term and long-term and the use of free cash flow towards credit? John Rainey : Sure. And, Bryan, it\u2019s good to speak with you. I\u2019ll start higher level, I think it\u2019s important to get context here. Credit is a very small part of our business, it\u2019s about 2% of our overall volume, but it\u2019s also a very important part of our business. It complements a holistic set of payment offerings for our customers. And our merchants ask for it to be integrated into the checkout experience, because they see firsthand that the benefits of improved conversion and higher basket size. That said, as I discussed in my prepared remarks, we can obtain a lot of the benefits from credit by doing it in a more asset-light way, which we\u2019ll disclose more about later. Overall, we\u2019re very comfortable with the performance of our portfolio. And I would suggest that it\u2019s in line with our expectations. We did increase our provision and as I discussed on the last earnings call, we have seen some deterioration in our late stage delinquencies. But we\u2019ve also seen a lot of signs of health too and that our weighted average FICO scores improved from the last quarter. We\u2019ve also seen the lowest quarterly charge-off rate in four quarters this year. We were obviously coming off of historic lows in credit and I think getting to something good as a more normalized rate going forward. But that rate is very consistent with both our underwriting expectations as well as our return goals for the business. So we\u2019re comfortable with credit. Thinking longer-term about what we do, the agreement with Latitude is a good indication of how we\u2019re thinking about moving forward with credit. We also can do something with our existing portfolio. And we\u2019ve got several different options that we\u2019re evaluating. Some of those take time, because they could be bigger in nature and we plan to discuss those in the coming quarters. Thanks, Bryan. Bryan Keane : Okay. Yes, and then just a quick follow-up, looking at the three-year outlook the FX-neutral revenue growth is 100 to 200 basis points higher than the previous midterm guidance. But the FX-neutral TPV growth is the same at mid-20. So what drives that higher revenue growth with the same volume expectations? Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. John Rainey : You bet. And I would read too much into that Bryan. The mid 20s TPV growth is a broader range than the 16% to 17%. While that\u2019s not updated, we obviously do have some expectation about an improvement in payment volume as well. Bryan Keane : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Pellar with Barclays. Your line is now open. Darrin Pellar : Thanks, guys. Just looking for a little more color on the dynamics behind margins in 2017 and your medium-term outlook, I guess, margins being down about 150 bps in the quarter. First of all, I guess, if you could just tell us, maybe what it would have been without any maybe hedging impacts or Xoom investments? And then looking at the outlook you gave, I think you mentioned certain revenue or products that would help offset margin pressure from customer choice. I mean is that PayPal Credit or are there other products around that? Thanks guys. Dan Schulman : And so, what was the last thing which you said there? Darrin Pellar : Just trying to figure out, you mentioned in the longer-term or I think the 2017 outlook that margins could be holding up for 2016 levels based on basically other products, other revenue and some cost initiatives. Just wondering if those other products is PayPal Credit or if there is other products in there? Dan Schulman : Okay, yeah, sorry, I didn\u2019t hear that. Okay. I\u2019ll start and maybe a couple - the other guys can jump in. Specifically, you asked about the effect of hedging in the quarter. Hedging was about 1 point of EPS for the quarter versus last year for us. Our hedge gain was about $28 million to $30 million in the quarter and it was $10 million to $15 million higher last year. So that certainly affected the margin performance in the quarter. But I would - but we want to emphasize though that we indicated this when we gave the guidance last time in the last call, we made some investments in our business in the quarter. And there you typically think of the seasonality of our business. Our fourth quarter can be 15% to 20% larger than the third quarter. And so we tend to staff up in certain areas to prepare for that. We\u2019re also - we look at the opportunity that we have in front of us, which everyone recognizes with the huge addressable market. That does require some investing and we\u2019re not going to shy away from that. We\u2019ve indicated that we expect margins to be stable to growing over time. But we\u2019re not going to be a slave to margin performance from one quarter to the next, particularly if it means that it\u2019s at the expense of investing in the business. That said, we also recognize that we don\u2019t get a pass from the market. And we\u2019re going to continue to drive revenue growth and earnings performance like we\u2019ve seen. With respect to some of our products, we\u2019ve got a host of different things that Bill and his team are working on. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily pinpoint credit as the opportunity in terms of product expansion next year. What we are thinking more broadly is just in terms of how we can offer other types of products and experiences for our customers. Darrin Pellar : All right. Thanks, guys. Dan Schulman : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Great, thanks. Thanks for all the details here. I just wanted to dig into the raised revenue outlook. How much of that raise is coming from customer choice may possible by Visa, MasterCard deals? I\u2019m asking for both next year and also in the mid-term. For example, is there a backlog of new issuer partnerships, just trying to gauge where your confidence is coming from? Dan Schulman : Yeah, I\u2019ll take that and then turn it over to either Bill or John from there. Thanks for the question. I think just in general, if you step back, we think we have an incredibly large opportunity in front of us. I mean, think about it, we are 10% of the e-commerce, and e-commerce is 10% of retail. So when we look at the addressable opportunity in front of us, we think we have maybe 1% share or something like that. And so there is a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. And we are seeing very good momentum in the business right now. Bill and his team have put into place over the course of this year, a number of new services, a number of new products. We\u2019ve upgraded of our work flows by the upgrading of our platform. And so we see a tremendous amount of momentum coming into the business. Obviously, as we think about choice, we think about choice more over the medium and longer terms pieces of this in terms of its impact in terms of growth for us. And so, as we think about next year we think really about the momentum of the business carrying us into that. As we think further out, obviously, the increased adoption, engagement, and the other services and offerings that we are putting out beyond choice that will go into the market will all fuel that growth. And then on the margin side, as John mentioned, we feel we have a lot of room in our cost structure, a lot of OpEx room. But we also in addition to that are putting out new services and new enhancements that have increased margins associated with them. And so as we looked at our medium term or our three year outlook, we felt very comfortable taking that revenue outlook up and maintaining our margin guidance. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Yeah, so my question is with regards to the 2017 guide itself. And any specific assumptions you are making in there with regards to the market implementation of Visa and MasterCard deals? And in what form do you expect some of the deals to take? I mean, what\u2019s the purview, what you are actually discussing with the issuers? Dan Schulman : Yeah. So I\u2019ll let Bill answer some of the issuer things that we are talking about. But I would just say that as you look into 2017 the vast majority of that is the current momentum of the business. So Visa, MasterCard and the issuer implementations, those will happen as we go through next year. But we don\u2019t assume a lot of either revenue or volume increase as a result of that. So we are trying to be reasonably conservative on the - on what we will see next year from that. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and then Bill can expend on this, we are having quite a number of conversations with issuers, both large and small in terms of ways that we can partnered together. I\u2019ll let Bill get into the details of that. But the overall tenor of the discussions are extremely positive. And one other thing, I\u2019ll just say before I turn it to Bill is with the tokenization schema that we have from the networks, the issuers don\u2019t need to do anything. They just need to opt into it. So we don\u2019t need to put out announcements for every one of these and we don\u2019t plan to go and do that either. There\u2019ll be some that we\u2019ll announce no doubt, but the majority of those, since there is really nothing that needs to be done, usually just needs to opt in, we\u2019ll just start to implement. Bill Ready : Yeah. I\u2019ll just add that - to Dan\u2019s point, while the issuers don\u2019t need to do things to enable us to use tokens and those types of things that we\u2019re receiving from Visa and MasterCard is just an opt in, it\u2019s also the case of the things we\u2019re doing around choice. We\u2019re able to do and deliver value to our customers in the ecosystem without them having to do work on their end. So this isn\u2019t really a framework of a lot of one-off announcements, but one where we set a framework of how we work with the broader industry. And we\u2019re seeing from the experiences we\u2019ve rolled out already that, as was mentioned earlier in the call by Dan and John, engagement lift, those types of things that we have been seeing from consumer choice even ahead of our deals with Visa and MasterCard in the broader ecosystem. We\u2019re seeing those things play out in the way this is very much in line with how we thought about going into choice overall. Ashwin Shirvaikar : It just seems like you are assuming cost, but not assuming potential revenue benefits. Dan Schulman : I think that\u2019s predominantly right on that, that there will be smaller amounts of revenue benefit in 2017. But we are able to cut out not just cost in our OpEx. I\u2019ll give you one example of that. Obviously, we have a good percentage of our calls coming into our customer care centers are around funding type, and since we\u2019re going to be implementing that, those costs are something that we can take out of our business immediately. And so, there are other pieces of the cost structure that we can elaborate on if you\u2019re interested that we will address. But on top of that we have had quite a number of new products this year that are giving us incremental margins, incremental lift and engagement such as One Touch is the perfect example of that. And now they carry over into next year as well. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to start with a very quick clarification. I know you said next three years on the medium-term guidance. So through 2019, would that be accurate? Dan Schulman : Yes, it\u2019s more or less. Three years is probably too precise, as you can fully appreciate when you get into a longer-term plan horizon, that there is less certainty with each passing year. We tend to think of how we\u2019re growing the business in that multiyear, three-ish year timeframe. And so I think that that\u2019s accurate. I don\u2019t know that, where we want to be so specific as to say that it ends at December 31, 2019. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Dan Schulman : The way that we set our three-year outlook, yes, end of 2019, but I think John\u2019s point is a good one. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, understood. And just on operating margin. So in the quarter what was the headwind on operating margins from Xoom and it looks like in your Q4 guide, we\u2019re seeing implied operating margins to be modestly up year-over-year. Is that accurate? Dan Schulman : Yes. You could take the guidance range and throw that. Xoom has been - as we\u2019ve talked consistently this year, little bit of a drag on our margins. I would actually point though that the bigger impact in the quarter on operating margin was related to the increased provision around credit. And we\u2019ve talked for a long time about the different leverage we have in the business, even despite having that increase in cost in the quarter. I think we demonstrated our ability to pull those levers by still coming at the high-end of our guidance range. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Your line is now open. Scott Devitt : Hi, thanks for taking the question. First, Dan, you mentioned in the press release the roll out of the customer choice in the U.S. I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about where you are with that in the U.S. and the roadmap on a global basis in coming quarters. And then secondly, as you think about the business strategically, now that you are in all these different areas of financial services layered on top of the B2C payments platform, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about your interest in being other verticals, and if so, what those are or should we think about the business more in terms of where you are now in terms of businesses and growing wallet share within those businesses? Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yeah. So let me take the more strategic part of that question, which is where we see ourselves going, and then turn over to Bill to talk explicitly around where we are in the customer choice piece of it. And so, we talked a little bit about PayPal moving from being well beyond just a button on a website to really two things. For merchants, we want to be a full service solution provider. As the world move towards mobile, merchants are looking to write applications to take advantage of that mobile across online, in app, mobile web and in store. And they are trying to create those applications to enable them to get closer to consumers and create distinct differentiated value propositions. We basically want to power those applications with our platform. We want to do a 100% share of checkout. We want to integrate rewards capabilities through API and toolsets into our platform. We want to integrate contextual commerce into our platform, credit into our platform, so that merchants of all sizes can write the applications to get them closer to their customers and we can power that with our platform. And then we take the extensive number of consumers we have, the 177 million consumers we have, on top of the 15 million merchants we have. And we drive those consumers in a friction-free way to be able to sign up for those merchant apps. So we are really trying to be a much more extensive partner to merchants, as they make this change in a mobile-centric world, things like the One Touch and conversion rate, and all that is tremendously powerful for them. On the consumer side, we are looking to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move money. We\u2019ve talked about our longer-term engagement goals, which are to go from, but we\u2019re now 2.5 times a month, we were 2 times a month when we started that, but we to go to something like 2 times a week. And we know that\u2019s a longer term goal. But if you look at what we\u2019ve done with choice in enabling consumers to not just say, how they want, but where they want. And this is why I gave the example in Spain, I mean, it\u2019s obviously very early days and not a significant number of customers to get, but those customers just offline are using the service 6 times a month on there, so you can start to see that engagement. And we were looking at a host of other things we\u2019ve now integrated into Xoom, so that U.S. customers of PayPal can now use international remittances. It\u2019s another service offering on top of that. And I don\u2019t want to give away any future off my hands right now on the call. But you can expect us to continue to grow the set of offerings that we give to consumers. And so, as you look out over the medium term, you can expect us to continue to expand and grow our business, not just take the business we have. And follow the tailwinds of digitization, which will really drive that. Bill Ready : On the point of the roadmap for the customer choice implementation, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, I call out that many of those core concepts we have been testing even prior to these deal. And so we have rolled out, I would say, much of the core concepts of choice. Dan called out one of those earlier in the call around the ability to pay with things other than your PayPal balance. And as we have rolled those out importantly we are seeing consumer behavior on those really in line with how we expected that to play out from our prior testing around these things. So very much going as planned on that front. And then as we come into next year, we\u2019ll have some more of these things that will sort of layer in as we come into the first-half of next year. But the core concepts around users being able to pay however they want and us not influencing them or requiring them to use things of our preference. Those core concepts have been implemented and/or you were seeing consumer behavior as we would have expected from our prior testing around those things. And finally, I will just call out some of the really beneficial points around what we get from those, access to tokens, instant withdrawals, those types of things we expect to have coming as we get into the first-half of next year. Dan Schulman : Yeah. I\u2019ll just add on that, Bill. I think there are a couple of things that we did get from choice. Choice was a proactive strategic choice we made well before we started into negotiations with the networks. Actually our move to choice enabled us to open those conversations and to really start to think about how do we become the allies with financial institutions and networks to drive digital payments together. And I mentioned in my remarks the elimination of digital wallet fees and the cost certainty. They will talk about tokens. And that allows us to move in a very seamless way into in-store environments. But it also enabled us to have like the equivalent of what you would think of as card present rates coming into the in-store environment. It\u2019s a profitable way for us to move into the in-store environment. And the other thing we obviously got some network discounts on top of that, as well as instant access to fund when somebody is trying to remove funds from the PayPal account through their bank account. And that was an important value proposition gap that we had. And we saw in other countries like the UK, where we do have that today, that people actually increased their balance on the PayPal platform, when they know they can take that money off instantaneously. So it\u2019s a little counterintuitive to what most people are seeing that we got a lot of experience and know-how in that. Scott Devitt : Thank you for the color. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Okay, you bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of RBC capital. Your line is now open. Daniel Perlin : Thanks. I had a question about - and you talk a little bit about it - but the engagement side of the equation. You\u2019ve seen obviously numbers increase quite a bit. I\u2019m wondering how much of it up to this point at least is really a function of this mix shift to different types of transactions? You talk about Venmo users, obviously a much higher frequency. But I want to parse that with the types of merchant relationships that you\u2019re now able to engage in, because it would seem as though from the legacy business you\u2019re in with eBay, you didn\u2019t have a lot of frequency with those merchants, you might go to eBay a lot, you don\u2019t necessarily go to those merchants a lot. And the announcements you guys keep making seem like just the consumer proposition to go back to that same merchant seems materially higher. So I\u2019m just trying to think about how do those two kind of, I guess, shifts drive, kind of the forward look. Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yeah. I first start off at, obviously, eBay is a large and incredibly important customer to us. We work, though hand in hand, with that team to try and drive as much business as possible through that partnership. But, obviously, as we split apart from eBay, part of the premise of that was that as a truly neutral third-party digital payments platform that we could partner with numerous merchants and retailers that might have seen the relationship that we have with eBay as competitive to them and so that we wouldn\u2019t have been independent. I think a great example of that is Alibaba. We have been nurturing that relationship with them. We\u2019ve done a couple of different announcements through the quarters. We started with wholesalers with them. But now really AliExpress is the main marketplace of Alibaba. That\u2019s where really all their merchants are. And we\u2019ve already started with PayPal being a team in options on that. It\u2019s really a great example of it, because we have great strengths outside of China with consumers. They have great strengths with merchants inside China, who are already a major cross-border player in the Chinese corridor. So that match would never happen have we not been an independent third party. And that\u2019s happening with numerous retailers as well, especially as we expand our value proposition now to really appeal to a mobile-centric world, that one retailer after another of all sizes are thinking about. Bill Ready : Yeah, in addition to that I would also add that, while we have expanded reach with merchants, it\u2019s also the case that our core experiences, as Dan mentioned earlier on the call, things like PayPal One Touch with now more than 30 million consumers and active in 200 markets around the world, we\u2019re seeing increasing engagement from those products on - or those consumers on our core products. So, yes, we have new experiences like Venmo that are highly engaged. But we\u2019re also improving engagement on our core products. And interestingly, as you\u2019ve seen some third-parties validate, such as the comScore\u2019s value that looked PayPal conversion versus other new entrants to the market in standard checkout, our conversion is nearly 40 points higher that our nearest competitor with us at 87.5% and the nearest competitor at 51%. That\u2019s an example of our increasing relevancy with consumers as they move to mobile and are demanding more and seamless experiences as evidenced by the higher conversion rate that we have. So it is on multiple fronts that we\u2019re seeing that improvement in engagement. But the core product itself we are seeing great increasing relevance with our consumers. Daniel Perlin : Great, thank you. Operator : We have time for one last question from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache : Thanks. I had a follow-up question on some of your earlier comments around just your partnerships. Is it reasonable to conclude that part of the focus in your discussions is around not just existing PayPal customer TPV, but also aligning incentives and finding ways to both issuers and PayPal to benefit from the addition of incremental volumes from new PayPal customers? Just trying to understand how much focus there is in kind of the discussions around the addition of new users beyond the existing base? Dan Schulman : Yes, Bill, great question. First of all, the networks nor PayPal would have done the deal that we did, have we not already been speaking with issuers and have we not known that issuers were going to be very favorably inclined to this. And so, this wasn\u2019t sort of a one-two punch, where the first punch was the network deals and the second one was going out to issuers, where many conversations happening simultaneously. And I would say all of the conversations that we are having with issuers involve incremental volumes and incremental customers. There is not one conversation that\u2019s just about, well, let\u2019s just talk about PayPal base, let\u2019s say, we\u2019re going to talk about the base that\u2019s within that issuer base. It\u2019s all about how we increase volumes, how we increase the adoption and the number of accounts utilizing PayPal. So, yes, well, that is pretty much the focus of the conversations that we\u2019re having with issuers. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. I appreciate your responses. Dan Schulman : Yes, well, thank you for that question and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We really appreciate the time out of your busy schedules and we look forward to speaking with you again in the near future. Thank you, operator. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

Darrin Pellar - Barclays Investment Bank Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the PayPal Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Scheibe Rabinovitch : Thank you, Karen. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet. And both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company\u2019s performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2017. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, January 26, 2017. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal ended 2016 with another solid quarter of financial results. I\u2019m proud of all the accomplishments that the PayPal team delivered, yet in so many ways we were just scratching the surface of the market opportunities in front of us. Payments are rapidly digitizing. Mobile is re-defining the phase of retail. And with the world wide adoption of smart phone consumers have all the power of a bank branch in the palm of their hands, which will no doubt transform the way they manage and move money. We believe all of these secular trends play into our strengths and leave us well positioned to drive our future growth. In the phase of a noisy competitive market, we extended our industry leaderships by growing our active account base by 18 million with greater engagements than ever before. We introduced a host of new innovations across our merchant and consumer value propositions. We took the clear lead in online conversion through one touch.  We now offer a full suite of products and services to our merchants on an integrated platform that supports 100% share of processing and textual commerce API and toolsets, rewards integration and credit. And we bring to our merchants an increasingly active and growing days of consumers who are ready to transact across online, in-app, and in-store environments. In the past year, we significantly increased our market opportunity for the series of transformative strategic partnerships with the networks, financial institutions, tax companies, and mobile carriers. We accomplish this by putting our customers first in everything we do. We call this being a customer champion and this philosophy guides our every action. At the end of a land mark year for PayPal, we feel well positioned to deliver sustainable and profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.  Let me start with a quick recap of our results and John will provide more details in his remarks. As I mentioned, we delivered a solid fourth quarter. We reported $0.42 of non-GAAP EPS at the top end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.42. We delivered $2.981 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis. This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow.  For the full year we delivered $1.50 of non-GAAP EPS, which came in at the top of our initial full-year guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Our revenues grew 21% on a pro forma FX neutral basis above our initial 2016 guidance of 19%. And despite the increased size of our revenue base, we grew faster in 2016 than in 2015. We ended the year at $10.84 billion of revenue and we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, well above the initial guidance we provided. Perhaps more importantly, the underlining drivers of our revenue growth saw continued strong performance throughout 2016. We ended the year with $197 million active customer accounts, adding 5.4 million new accounts in Q4, our highest organic total in two years. Customer engagement in the fourth quarter increased to 31 transactions for active accounts up from 27 a year ago, and 30 last quarter. Our growth in Q4 came from across our global platform and we benefited from a notable shift in consumer behavior. Holiday shoppers increasingly bought gifts online and with their mobile devices through convenient omni-channel shopping experiences. For PayPal, this helps drive a 25% increase in payment volume, resulting in $99.3 billion of payment volume in the quarter. According to Internet retailer, Black Friday 2016 was the largest mobile shopping day in history. Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday PayPal processed more than 2 billion in mobile payments. And mobile accounted for a third of our overall payment volume during the quarter. Mobile is becoming an increasingly important competitive differentiator for PayPal. More than half of our active account base transacted on the PayPal platform using their mobile device over the last 12 months.  The scale and reach of our platform clearly separates PayPal as one of the world's leading FinTech companies. In 2016, we processed 6 billion payments, an increase of 24%. This represented a total payment volume of 354 billion flowing through the PayPal platform of which more than 100 billion was mobile payment volume, an increase of 55%. We saw strong growth in peer-to-peer payments, with P2P payment volume growing 57%, more than $64 billion for the year. Braintree ended the quarter with 428 million cards on file, and PayPal has well over a billion financial instruments on file. In Venmo, was one of Time magazine's best apps of the year and one of Fortunes 10 breakthrough brands. In Q4, Venmo processed 5.6 billion volume, an increase of 126%. In December, for the first, Venmo passed the 2 billion mark in monthly payment volume further demonstrating its rapid growth.  As you may recall, Venmo processed 1 billion in monthly TPV for the first time just last January. For the full year, Venmo processed $17.6 billion, up 135%. It\u2019s been several years since we expanded our mission to be more than a button on the website. We have evolved to become the platform and payments partner of choice for merchants around the world, as they move towards a multichannel retail experience driven by the mobile phone. For example, with Braintree's commerce infrastructure tools, we are creating simpler ways for merchant install for contextual commerce experiences that transform the way consumers shop and pay. For entries forward API, which merchants securely share, payment data with other sites and apps, allowing customers to purchase from multiple merchants in a single convenient and secure experience. This capability was initially deployed to support interest viable pins and is now being used by merchants across the world, including global, travel site, sky scanner and by Yelp for their new product, Yelp cash back. One Touch has redefined online checkout. Simply put it produces by its and away the best conversion rate in the payments industry by making it faster and simpler for customers to pay with the single tax. Its adoption has well exceeded our projections. We ended the year with over 5 million merchants offering One Touch to more than 40 million consumers. PayPal has the unique distinction in the corresponding benefit of having a deep and trusted relationship with almost 200 million merchants and consumer accounts through our two sided network.  This means we can deliver new payment experiences like One Touch for the speed and impact that there is truly differentiated. eBay and PayPal have always enjoyed a close partnership. eBay CEO Devin Wenig and I are committed to further strengthening what is already a strong relationship. We are working closely to creating better payment experiences for their buyers and sellers.  For example, our teams collaborated this past year on new customized checkout experiences that helps to reduce card abandonment, increase loyalty, and help buyers seamlessly transact on eBay's platform. As we look to 2017, we see even greater opportunities to work together. In the quarter, we were also proud to welcome several great brands to our platform. These include auto. DE, the second-largest retailer in Europe, Crate and Barrel, which now offers PayPal as a payment option on its web and mobile sites, and on the CB2 and landed not cite for their global customers. Squarespace, an all in one website publishing e-commerce platform. Now it\u2019s more than 1 million paid subscribers. Seamlessly integrate PayPal into their online stores. To give you an idea of the demand for PayPal within the first 24 hours of launching, we saw hundreds of Squarespace merchants integrate into PayPal and that demand continues. Finally, consumers can now create a campaign on go funding on behalf of their favorite charity. By doing so they take advantage of the PayPal giving funds facility to receive and process donations and avoid the complexity of having to handle the funds themselves. Last year, highlighted our commitment to putting our customer\u2019s front and centre. That led to our decision to offer greater customer choice in our payments experiences. This in turn has a recast to competitive landscape for PayPal and enables landmark partnerships and alliances that continue to expand and extend our opportunity for growth.  These partnerships are focused on giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to use PayPal anywhere they want, in stores, in apps, online and a new context for the consistent, convenient, and secure experience, following the announcements of our strategic partnership with Visa on our Q2 earnings call and MasterCard in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we announced our first partnership agreement with financial institutions. These include agreements with Citi, the largest global credit card issuer and Fidelity National Information Services known as FIS, which represents thousands of financial institutions. This is just the beginning. As our conversation with almost all leading financial service players are warm and welcoming. Earlier this month, we announced the strategic agreement with Discover Financial Services. This partnership allows the PayPal wallet to be closely linked and Discover cardholders acquires and merchants.  It will allow PayPal credit customers who link their discover cards to purchase online, in-app and in-store at contact listed enable merchants in the US. And in a first for us, PayPal customers will be able to use their discover cash back bonus to pay for purchases at the millions of online and mobile merchants that accept PayPal. We expect that the reward points will become an easy convenient and alternative source for customers of PayPal and our financial institution partners, the pay for online and mobile shopping due to PayPal platform.  As mobile and digital payments continue to provide new opportunities for bringing cost consumers and companies close together, we're partnering with other market leaders across a variety of industries. In the fourth quarter, we entered into an extended partnership with cellular carriers, software providers and leading consumer brands. One prominent example of this is the global partnership agreement we announced with Intuit.  Building on successful regional agreements, we are not deploying our express checkout and more than 1.5 million quick book small businesses and self-employed customers worldwide. The PayPal and Intuit partnerships due to business owners simpler and faster ways to accept invoice payments and significantly accelerate the fees with which they can collect funds.  Based on our role out in Australia, we found that merchants who offered PayPal payments in their quick book invoices will pay two times faster than it to get paid without PayPal. This meaningful improvement in cash flow is crucial for the SMB market. We are proud to bring this benefit to Intuits customers. Our partnerships with Facebook, Google, American Mobile, Vodafone, AliExpress, and other financial institutions and major retailers continue to grow as our platform and capabilities expand. 2016 was a transformative year for PayPal. Our separation from eBay afforded us an opportunity to sign a unique, meaningful, and expansive mission for our company. I believe our expanded focus and value proposition allowed us to widen the distance from our competitors. We upgraded our platform invested significantly in our global compliance capabilities, improved our developer tool sets, and drove our scale and engagement through a unique and enhanced value proposition. We are inspired and focused on the opportunities in front of us and we look forward to providing ever more value to our customers and our shareholders. Before I conclude my remarks I\u2019d like to just take this opportunity to publicly welcome the newest member of PayPal\u2019s Board Belinda Johnson. Belinda has filled an impressive track record at Airbnb. She has been a key architect in their growth and has held to chart new business approaches and innovative customer experiences. She\u2019s already proving to be a great addition to our board and we look forward to her valuable contributions.  And with that, let me hand it over to John. John Rainey : Thanks Dan. I also wanted to that thank all of PayPal's customers and employees worldwide for making 2016 great year. Since our founding in 1998, this is the first full year that PayPal has been an independent public company and we achieved many significant milestones that set us up for success for many years to come. We are strategically positioned to deliver sustainable and profitable growth. Our comprehensive partnership strategy and focus on mobile first product innovation, which our customers at the center of everything we do while giving us access to multiple developing channels across the digital payments ecosystem. Before I go into details on the quarter, I\u2019d like to provide a few highlights for the full year. Revenue for the year was $10.84 billion growing 21% on a pro forma currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS grew 17% on a pro forma basis for $1.50. Free cash flow grew 36% to $2.5 billion and in the year we returned $1 billion to shareholders. For the fourth quarter, total payment volume was $99 billion, up 25% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding the year over year impact of Xoom currency neutral TPV growth would have been similar to the third quarter.  In Q4, U.S. payment volume grew 23% and international volume grew 27%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $84 billion. Merchant services now represent approximately 84% of our total volume with our eBay volume, representing approximately 16%. In the fourth quarter, we added more than 5 million active accounts, ending the year with 197 million active accounts and representing growth of 10% from Q4 last year.  Active account growth was driven by our PayPal core business as well as in Venmo. The number of payment transactions per active accounts increased to 31, up 13%. Each quarter since separation we have seen double-digit growth in both active accounts and engagement. Growth in these two metrics resulted in a 23% year-over-year increase and payment transactions to $1.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, representing growth of 19% on a currency neutral basis and 17% on a spot basis. Transaction revenue increased 18% on a currency neutral basis in the quarter, driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, both of which continued to perform very well.  Included in transaction revenue were hedge gains of $50 million in the quarter. In addition, revenue from other value-added services grew 26% on a currency neutral basis driven predominantly by credit. For Q4, our total take rate was 3% and our transaction take rate was 2.63%. As we moved through 2016, we saw diminishing pressure on transaction take rate.  The decline in transaction take rate has improved for each of the last three quarters and in Q4 the rate of decline on a year-over-year basis was the lowest since separation. The primary factor contributing to the year-over-year decline in take rate is the performance of our P2P business, a strong growth from Venmo and core P2P continue to impact the rate. While these contribute to the year-over-year change in take rate, they also strengthened our value proposition and support higher levels of engagement across our consumer base.  Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we can invest in our long-term growth opportunities, while managing the take rate decline. Transaction margin in the fourth quarter was 57.7%. Our volume based expenses were up 27% in the quarter. Transaction expense was $954 million, up 27%, driven by fund index. To date, the impact of our consumer choice initiatives has been well within the range of outcomes we previously contemplated.  Transaction loss in the quarter was $184 million or 6% of revenue. Loan losses in the quarter were $123 million. The consumer net charge-off rate was 7% in Q4 and 6.4% for the full year. The overall performance of our credit products in Q4 was consistent with our expectations entering the quarter. Across consumer and merchant credit, we ended the year with a gross receivables balance of $5.7 billion and a total reserve of $336 million. This year we increased the reserve to reflect the growth in our home portfolio, as well as our loss experience in later stage delinquency buckets. Other operating expenses increased 7%, the lowest rate of growth since separation driven by strong expense discipline. Excluding Xoom, other operating expenses only increased 6%. We completely offset the decline in transaction margin would leverage from other operating expenses. Looking forward, we see discipline cost performance across every area of our business. We are in the early stages of a journey that we expect will transform our business into one that scales more efficiently, and we are encouraged that we are already seeing results. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.8%, consistent with last year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16% year-over-year to $619 million, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $152 million or 5% of revenue. In addition, we generated $771 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up 37% year-over-year and representing $0.26 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. For the full year, we returned $1 billion to shareholders and we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $6.5 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. Now I\u2019d like to discuss our guidance for 2017, as well as provide context for our priorities and expectations for the year ahead. For the full year 2017, we expect revenue between $12.45 billion and $12.65 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 17% to 19%. We are pleased to be raising this outlook relative to the guidance we provided in October because of the momentum we are seeing in across our business and initiatives. At the same time, since we last spoke with you, we are seeing the currency markets move against us with a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Since November, we are seeing pressure from several of the currencies to which we have exposure. Notably, the euro and the Australian dollar have weakened by 5% and 7% respectively. This is on top of the all already sharp decline we saw on the pound last year. We are a global company operating in more than 200 markets with close to 50% of our revenue in a greater mix of our earnings coming from outside the U.S. Our hedging program is designed to reduce earnings volatility and we had to select basket of currencies to which we have the greatest earnings exposure. Given the timing at how we build our hedge positions and recent moments across a broad range of currencies that affect our business, we expect FX headwinds throughout the year. We anticipate a greater impact in the first half and will continue to update you on a currency exposure as we move through the year. At current exchange rates for the full year, we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 200 basis points, resulting in sport growth of 15% to 17%. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin in 2017 to be flat to slightly up or approximately 20%. Given that many of our initiatives ramped throughout the year, we expect to deliver greater operating income growth in the second half relative to the first. We anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19% and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.69 and $1.74. Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. For 2017, we anticipate free cash flow to exceed $2.7 billion, including CapEx of approximately 5% of revenue. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.9 billion and $2.95 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.40 and $.42.  Now I would like to spend a moment talking about capital allocation. We take a disciplined approach to how we deploy cash flow and continue to pursue a capital allocation strategy balancing organic investment, M&A, and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed last quarter, we were assessing a more asset life strategy for our credit business. While it is too early to provide additional detail, moving more of our credit receivables of balance sheet and potentially further partnering on the origination side and free up cash and give us additional flexibility. In addition, our guidance includes our initial $500 million in share repurchases for 2017 and we will continue to be opportunistic as it relates to our buyback program. We will keep a close eye on the evolving landscape for taxes and repatriation and evaluate how that may alter or enhance our capital allocation going forward. We are committed to allocating capital in a manner to maximize returns and increase shareholder value. In closing, 2016 was a great first year for PayPal as a separate public company. As we move through 2017, we're focused on delivering increased shareholder value with our growth strategies. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Great thank you, good afternoon. Just, maybe can you be a little bit more specific to what\u2019s driving the upside to of fiscal 2017 guidance versus the outlook you provided last quarter and is there any material contribution from customer choice for example in your guidance, thanks. Dan Schulman : You're talking about the increase in our revenue guidance? Tien- tsin Huang : Correct. Versus what you gave last quarter for fiscal 2017. Dan Schulman : So, we are taking off our revenue guidance on an FX neutral basis and the reason we are doing that is there is a tremendous amount of secular tailwinds that we are seeing right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, seeing money digitizing is a big move to mobile, it is a big move to really online being sort of online payments and then pick up in stores or commerce is really just becoming commerce. I mean a great example of that is this was the best retail holiday season in five years, but you saw - in-store sales actually drop and online move up to almost 17%, 18% or so. And so as we look at these secular tailwinds behind us, we look at the performance of things like One Touch and its clear advantage that we have now in mobile and the scale we have the increased engagement we are seeing. New market opportunities frankly internationally that we are beginning to see and have a platform now that we can extend to many more markets of Venmo.  We see the beginning of monetization as we come into this year. And we are seeing the back of the year, the beginnings of some in-store volumes based on tokenization and our partnerships with both the network and financial institutions and then we've got a tremendous number of new partnerships, whether it be with Facebook, or Intuit or FI\u2019s really around the world right now that is growing exponentially since we've announced our network agreement. So there are a host of reasons right now that our confidence has improved in terms of our top line growth rate and by the way that\u2019s also lacking 200 million of Xoom. So think about that, as well as you think about kind of the revenue guidance we gave. So, we think they are good prospects ahead of us. We are very focused on those opportunities and we are comfortable with that guidance. John. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks, good afternoon. So, a question on transaction and loss expenses growth, can you desegregate that into transaction growth in loan loss, I might have missed that. In view of the other expense leverage you are getting, can you provide details on what sort of actions that are leading to this and the sustainability of those actions? John Rainey : Yes, Ashwin you cut out a little bit on the first part of your question. I will answer what I think you asked related to the transaction and loan losses, but I think I want to take the second part first because that\u2019s the big story, and I think sub context probably worth repeating that we completely offset the transaction margin decline with the operating leverage that we have in business. And it\u2019s not just one area of the business it\u2019s really across the board. It\u2019s probably hard to pass through our P&L and identify that because there is noise related to the year-over-year comparisons from separation, but this really covers every aspect of what we do, and what I would encourage you to think about all this is it\u2019s not a one-time cost take-out opportunity. We are rewiring the way that we work, that we do business in a manner so that we can grow and scale at the rate that we've identified, but do it in a very efficient way.  So, whether it\u2019s where our real estate footprint is or where we - how we buy things, how we market to customers even getting down to the very product development aspects of our business to do it in a way where we can roll our products in a much grander fashion rather than doing it in a sort of small products rollouts one country at a time. It\u2019s changing the way that we operate. And this is not easy work to be clear. This is requiring us to be to really step back and reexamine ourselves, but I think you probably quickly see that cost performance is expected to continue when you look at our guidance in 2017 that enables us to keep our operating margin flat to growing.  With respect to the transaction expense and transactional loan losses growing, we did see an uptick in transaction expense on a unit basis by 4 basis points or 5 basis points during the quarter and that\u2019s really related to the mix of our business, it\u2019s a continuation of what you've seen in other quarters as some parts of our business are going faster than others that may carry higher transaction expense. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Good afternoon just wanted to ask on the move to announce a light strategy, how could you guys potentially limit the EPS dilution hit from a move like that and then secondly John just on the hedge gains just curious if there is a number we can get for the quarter and what\u2019s in the expectation for hedge gains in fiscal year 2017? Thanks so much. Dan Schulman : Bryan it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then I\u2019ll wisely let John take the next part of it. So, let me just back up a little bit, as you know and everyone on the call knows credit is and will continue to be an important flywheel for us. Credit gives flexible payment option to both our margins and to consumers. It reduces card abandonment, it increases basket size for our merchants and consumers. When somebody uses credit they do two times the spend on our PayPal network than somebody who doesn't. When we do PayPal working capital on average those that we lend to, they see their sales go up 20% plus, and so it\u2019s a tremendous flywheel for us. It is a small part of a business and it\u2019s likely to remain so as well. We don't need to chase growth here, we can be very responsible and who we lend to and how much we lend to them. And we have great amounts of data and really I think world class modeling around this. That said that is no reason really to use our balance sheet or the receivables and there are, as we've mentioned before, a lot of benefits of asset right. Obviously, we tie up a lot of our free cash flow in the receivables with free cash flow, for other capital allocation that we might do, we have reduced exposure, we still have a differentiated proposition that we would use our data and our modeling with our partner to bring back a differentiated proposition into our phase and there are very attractive economics to share. And as we've seen right now, from people who are very interested in partnering with us, our portfolio is very effective. The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business.  That is a working hypothesis as we are going through this. We are in the early process of looking through this right now because it is a very competitive process out there as people look to potentially partner with us, you know we look to make a decision as we digest and sort through all the different proposals that we\u2019re seeing, that said very much likely to be a - if we go and how we do this exactly with the back half of 2017 event, but clearly there is a lot of demand, there is a lot of benefits for us moving towards asset light and we think as I mentioned you reduce risk and maintain strong economics for the business. John Rainey : And Brian with respect to hedges, I said in my prepared remarks that we expect about 200 basis points of headwind in 2017 from foreign currency that\u2019s actually net of the hedge position that we have. So, to fill in more detail on that in the quarter, in the fourth quarter we had a $50 million hedge gain. And you will see in our K that\u2019s released here, in the next couple of weeks they had about 120 million of hedge gains for the year. That makes our current position today that\u2019s about and where markets are today. That\u2019s about what we are expecting for 2017.  I think maybe if there has been a moment to talk about our exposure because as you know more of our customers are international than here in the U.S. and a significant portion of our business is outside of the US. Just to use round numbers, as we said before, half of the revenue is outside of the U.S. and on a $12-ish billion base that $6 billion. Of that $6 billion about three quarters of it is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar or that aren\u2019t tied to the U.S. dollar. And so that gives us about $4 billion of the basket that we\u2019re exposed to.  So you can do quick math and recognize that a 1% change in the U.S. dollar relative to the basket of currencies on our revenue basis for us is about $40 billion annually. So, we're pretty sensitive to those moments, which is why we hedge the way that we do. We do hedge though to mitigate earnings volatility, not necessarily revenue. So, if you work your way down from that 40 million for a 1% change and you take the transaction margin on that and then you overlay the operating expenses that we have that are denominated in other currencies, as well as they are hedged, then the impact to operating income is much less than that. And as you will see when we release our K, we were able to mute a lot of the impact of the currency movements in 2016 with that hedge position. Bryan Keane : Okay very helpful, thanks for the details. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good afternoon guys. You did not, I don\u2019t think call out in your prepared remarks any metrics around Braintree, I think historically you said that Braintree was running at more than 100% volume growth year-on-year is that somewhat of what you are seeing now and then also just can you comment on the transaction expense uptick you\u2019ve seen in 2016, which I think has also been driven a bit by Braintree and just what the outlook is for both of those looking out into 2017? John Rainey : Sure. I\u2019ll start and allow Bill to jump in if he chooses. We continue to see great performance out of the Braintree part of our platform And in particular it\u2019s probably worth noting as we look at sequentially the year-over-year change in the third quarter compared to the year-over-year change in the fourth quarter, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that some of that was a result of Xoom and that for the same point in time in the fourth quarter of last year - of 2015 rather it was a quarter where we had exceptionally large growth for Braintree, which presented a more difficult comp. All that said Braintree is still growing very much in line with our expectations and continues to be a great and complimentary part of our platform. And as I cited in my earlier response to a Ashwin, part of the uptick and transaction expense is related to the mix of our portfolio specifically Braintree tends to be more card-based and as we\u2019ve seen that growth that\u2019s the transaction expense that\u2019s for the fourth quarter. Bill Ready : This is Bill. I would like to add to that that not only the Braintree business itself is doing well, the B0 [ph] API that really brings together the 100% share to check out the Braintree processes, as well as PayPal\u2019s best experience including PayPal One Touch, and PayPal credit, all those things. We are seeing that really become a preferred way that merchants integrate to pay now and get access to the full breadth of our experiences. It\u2019s a big part of our mobile first strategy and a big part of it is driving PayPal's presence in many of the most interesting new commerce experiences out there.  So, you heard us talk about what we are doing at interest buy buttons, Facebook messenger having commerce experiences for companies like Uber and others. Those things are all running through our Braintree platform. So we are seeing the strategy of Braintree and a 100% share of checkout, not only driving good great growth for our business, but getting our best experiences out there to more merchants to really interesting margins, really just to commerce experiences and available to our consumers as they encounter to those new commerce experience. So, we've been quite pleased with that and see that momentum continue to build in terms of Braintree as a key enabler of many of those interesting commerce experiences out there. Lisa Ellis : Terrific thanks John and Bill. Dan Schulman : Next question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Cakmak, Monness, Crespi, Hardt. James Cakmak : Hi, just two quick ones. Just on the regulatory environment, anything you can provide on how you're thinking about this year as you look at Durbin, the [indiscernible] so forth and then just on mobile, I know it is up 53% this quarter, and we saw the step up in 2016 versus 2015. I guess as we anniversary one such and I guess Xoom next year, what\u2019s the magnitude of the step down that we should expect? Thanks a lot. Dan Schulman : Let me try and jump the two questions in there. So let me start with the mobile and then I will go into the impact of some regulatory and change of administrations. Mobile, mobile is driving growth in the industry right now. I mean more half the sales that are going online are being driven by mobile. Mobile is blurring lines of distinction between in-store environment and online environments, where like commerce is just becoming commerce. And truthfully, mobile is the biggest competitive differentiator for us. If we think about mobile, the real problem that merchants have with mobile is that when a browser begins the shopping experience on mobile between 65% and 74% of the time there is card abandonment because it\u2019s such a small screen, it\u2019s difficult to put of the payment information in there et cetera. So with One Touch we have 87% conversion on mobile. 87%.  The next closest is 51%, the industry average is like 44%. So, we are at almost double the industry average in terms of the mobile experience that we see and mobile is exploring across the world, as well as I mentioned in terms of why did we take up our revenue guidance, pick it up because we see opportunity across the world and that\u2019s predominantly driven by mobile. So, I had spent mobile to continue to fewer our growth. Remember one other thing I said in my remarks with over half of our active basis on mobile payment transaction is through the PayPal platform in the last 12 months, over 100 billion in the volume of 55% for the year. So expect that to, not particular what the growth rate will be one way or the other, but mobile is going to be a strong driver of growth and it\u2019s a big differentiator for us. John Rainey : The only thing I would add to that is just because you are talking about lapping effect on some of that, what we\u2019ve done with PayPal One Touch, we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can role that out to millions of merchants and millions of consumers, without them having to make changes and so PayPal One Touch is the first in many generations and that\u2019s a real competitive advantage for us that has others in the industry are out there trying to convince merchants to integrate new experience and things like that. We're just showing up and solving the problem for them without them having to do work.  So, as you think of about playing that forward, we expect as many generations of us continuing to improve mobile experience, and uniquely we can do that without merchants having to do work on their end because we control the foreign experience. So as Dan was commenting, we expect that to continue for because of the secular trend. We also think we have a better ability than to talking about everybody else in the industry to continue to iterate and improve on those experiences because we can push out more fully for the day and upgrade those experiences whereas other have cycle that will be many, many months long because merchants have to make changes on their end. Bill Ready : Good point. Let me talk a little bit about the change in administration and how we think about it in terms of the impact in our business. I start off, of course it\u2019s incredibly early days and there is a lot of talk about different things, but we are yet to see specifics around that. So, let's just talk about a couple of them because I know they are on your mind. From a regulatory perspective, obviously people are talking about changes and frank changes and potentially have CNTV [ph], is managed, but the first and most important thing is we are completely focused on being acquired with any and all regulatory environments that are out there.  We believe that what regulators want, what we want are completely aligned and we are investing a tremendous amount of resource, but from a development or platform human resource perspective to assure that we are at compliance as we possibly can be regardless about the regulatory environment shifts, it is not just here in the U.S. but obviously across the world. Second, within Dodd Frank, a lot of people talk about Durban. We feel Durban is very unlikely to be over turned. First of all, as bad conversions, is bad for small business, not good for consumers. The only people who benefit are big banks from that and there is a big lobby of people that we think tried very hard for Durbin, it need 16 votes in the Senate. They will return this is not a of lightning rod issue, for Democrats or Republicans and so we think it is very unlikely given everything else that\u2019s going on at Durbin is overturned.  We've also pointed out as John mentioned, the great deal of our business is overseas, not impacted by the Durbin at all, the impact even if it wasn't overturned, it is probably a lot smaller than you might imagine and we work on our way through that, but we will - again I think it is very unlikely to be overturned. Tax is something people talk about and we obviously have a lot of our business that is overseas. I think net, net still very early days, we would probably see a small net benefit in some of the Braintree or other things that have been thrown around in terms of tax changes, but maybe a little bit less than others might see, given our current tax environment. If we are allowed to repatriate funds from offshore in a more tax efficient manner, that might make a big difference in the way we think about capital allocation, and so we think that will be made net positive. There is a lot of talk about protectionism of large percentage of our cross-border trade happens outside the U.S. It\u2019s not impacted by any of this at all.  Our average selling price is $60. Think about that. Tariff only applied to goods and services over $800. So most of this is not going to apply to what we do on a day in and day out basis and in a rising interest rate environment plus a net benefit to our revenue and our net income, if we see that happen. So, all in there is likely a good net positive impact to our business based on the change in the administration, but again, very early days to see how it plays out and then we will report out to you as we learn more. James Cakmak : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel. Scott Devitt : Yes, hi. A question first on One Touch, I was just wondering if you could provide a new more detail about adoption within the $ 40 million consumer accounts in terms of maybe the penetration of the addressable TPV that they are actually using that product that have adopted into or opted into One Touch, and then secondly what the friction points are, you know of growing that penetration rate from here against the other 150 accounts and that haven\u2019t yet adopted the product? Thank you. John Rainey : So we have 14 million of approximately 2 million users that are on One Touch already and that's happened really in the course of just over a year. So the adoption there is more rapidly than anything that PayPal ever put out and we see that adoption continuing. So, we think there is lot more left there in terms of the 40 million that have opted in to it versus the nearly 200 million total users that we have. Same on the margin side, we have more than half of the internet retailer at 500, accepting One Touch and costing 5 million of our 15 million merchants accepting it, but we have more growth left in that as well and we are working through those pretty rapidly.  So all that to say, we think there is great moment with One Touch, but we think that continued as we make that a level to more for our merchants and as more consumers get exposed to it. As Dan mentioned in his remarks, more than half of our active users have engaged in a mobile transaction with us and so we know there is going to be good demand as more, and more users get exposed to it. Scott Devitt : And if I could follow-up just, I'm sorry Dan, did you have a comment on that? Dan Schulman : No, I was thinking in, see if I can [indiscernible]. Scott Devitt : Okay and we are just on a different topic, so feel free to expand on that, but we are just wondering John if there is some indication in the market in terms of that you didn't reiterate the three year guidance. And my assumption is it is not something you're going to be doing every quarter, you raised 2017 if you can just kind of address that that would be great, thanks. John Rainey : Sure. And you are exactly correct Scott. We are not going to get in the habit of updating three year guidance every quarter. There is no change to the guidance that we provided previously last quarter. Scott Devitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Pellar from Barclays. Darrin Pellar : Thanks guys. Can you just touch on what\u2019s included in your guidance with regard to Venmo monetization or pricing permit and then just also on the margin side, it seems your guidance were flat just to improving margins, it is actually despite the headwinds and I think you called that in Xoom, so what that has been, if you would have backed those items out and then maybe also stock, I mean it is also impacting margins, can you give us some more color on the driving, of course on the increase is there, thanks a lot guys. Nice job. Dan Schulman : I will start of a little bit and then you can jump in. So, like I say in terms of Venmo monetization pricing very little actually built into our guidance for 2017. We fully intend to rollout out Venmo, previous Venmo in a much broader basis in 2017. And we will see some impact in that, but really the big impact on that happens in 2018 and 2019. And so just see that and that\u2019s, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond it\u2019s because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but let\u2019s model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere and so not much is built into that. Not as much built into the customer choice piece of it, although I will say we\u2019re pretty encouraged by the initial results that we\u2019re seeing on choice.  We rolled that choice through all of North America, right now on the servicing piece of choice, as well as the on boarding of that, we are just beginning in checkout right now, but as John mentioned in his remarks from a cost perspective it is well within our expectations in terms of transaction expense and engagement, it is better than we expected in terms of engagement which by the way is not really surprising. If you give somebody the choice to pay, they become more engaged, the average price that they pay or the basket size that they have goes up, as well these are not surprising. We anticipated, but it\u2019s nice to see those things starting to really happen in the market, but we have a ton of that built into our guidance as well that to me is more of a 2018, 2019 phenomenon. Bill Ready : And just on a couple of points on hedge and stock comp. If you look at hedge and currency impact in total in the fourth quarter, it had a rather immaterial impact on our overall results when you consider the offset that we have from other operating expenses - from operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies as well. That wasn't a big driver. With respect to stock comp, we had $127 million of share-based compensation in the quarter and that was relative to 90 last year, I think it\u2019s important to point out that a couple of things related to that. One when we separate it from eBay we basically did a lifted shift with respect to our compensation programs and we change that in 2016 to make those compensation programs appropriate for PayPal.  And as part of that we change the vesting period related to our long-term compensation from four years previously to now 3 years. That element combined with just the natural increase in employees resulted in almost the entirety of that change year-over-year. I will say that we are a big believer in share-based compensation for our employees. We think get the alliance, their motivations without our shareholders, which we would all agree is a very good thing and if you look broadly across the industry stat and our comparables and you look at virtually any measure, take share-based compensation as a percent of revenue for example, we are in the lower quartile, the better quartile related to our peer group and there are various other ways you can look at that. We compare very favorably in all of them. Darrin Pellar : All right that's helpful there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to PayPal management for any additional comments. Dan Schulman : It's Dan. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. We know how busy all of you are and we look forward to seeing you at our investor conferences and talking to you on our next earnings call as well. So, thank you very much for your time. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good evening.",

And welcome to PayPal\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the first quarter 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentaries. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma measures because we believe that these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company\u2019s performance across different periods. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2017. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, April 26, 2017. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal began 2017 with an exceptional quarter. This continues a string of consistently strong performance since our separation from eBay in July 2015. We delivered solid operating and financial results this quarter. PayPal gained 6 million net new active accounts, a 35% increase from the 4.5 million net adds in Q1 a year ago. This represents largest organic quarterly increase in this important metric over the past three years. We ended the quarter with 203 million active accounts. We expect that our net adds will increase by more than 20 million in 2017 and once again our transactions per active account increases, growing in Q1 to 32 up from 28 a year ago. We reported $2.975 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis, above the high end of our guidance, driven predominantly by stronger core PayPal growth. PayPal delivered $.44 of non-GAAP EPS, which is $0.02 above the high end of our guidance as we are beginning to realize the sustainable benefits of our scale and we generated $603 million in free cash flow. This strong customer results clearly demonstrate our progress towards becoming the worlds leading open digital payments platform. We continue to build on our strategies of reimagining and democratizing the management and movement of money for our consumers. Helping drive the global transition from cash to digital payments and positioning our millions of merchants to benefit from the noble revolution at move to an all-digital cross-context retail environment. Our powerful two-sided network engages both consumers and merchants and the larger our scale the stronger our network effect becomes. We have made meaningful progress in advancing merchant adoption of PayPal in the quarter. At the end of March the number of active merchant accounts on our platform increased to 16 million. The size of our merchant base is a formidable competitive advantage and is extraordinarily difficult for others to replicate. We have provided one of the new brands at the PayPal platform including online fashion retailer with Vente-Privee in France, Papa John\u2019s and Groupon in U.S., leading Mexican department store chains, Coppel and Liverpool, and we made meaningful strides in the travel and tourism vertical in India with the addition of access rooms, Vista Rooms and MakeMyTrip. In addition, over 5 million merchants and 75% of the IRR 100 now offer our industry-leading One Touch checkout solution on their mobile and desktop shopping experiences. We expect the number of merchants accepting One Touch to increase noticeably throughout the year. We finished the quarter with 53 million consumers opted into One Touch. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this transformative product experience and the engagement that\u2019s driving with our customers. One Touch provides a powerful connection between our merchants and our consumers in a mobile first world. In the quarter, 32% of our payment volume came through mobile device and mobile payment volume increased 51% over the same period last year to approximately $32 billion. In the quarter, we also continue to innovate and transform how people send money to each other through P2P and remittent services. We continue to expand the functionality of our global remittent service Xoom. In the quarter we launched the Xoom service within the PayPal mobile app in the U.S. and plan to increase spending limits to $10,000 per transaction in the second quarter. We opened up the Japanese market in Q1 making Xoom now available in 56 different countries around the world. In the quarter Venmo continue to transform our millennials managed and engage with their money. In addition to being named is one of fast company\u2019s most innovative brands, the social P2P app process 6.8 billion in payments in the quarter. This more than double the volume processed year ago. Importantly, beginning in Q2 we plan to significantly enhance the social P2P payment experience that has made Venmo environment phenomenon. PayPal made Venmo available as a payment option on the brand three platform. We have the opportunity to test and learn as preserved unique nature of Venmo as we move the experience into new context. Today we are announcing the opening of our data for select U.S. PayPal merchants who accept Venmo as a mobile payment option. We anticipate the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely deployed across millions of our U.S. PayPal merchant base by the end of this year. Investments we have made in our platform architecture now allow us to enable Venmo as a payment method for our PayPal merchants without any additional integration work on their end, mirroring the approach we use to successfully rollout One Touch. While we continue to drive innovation inside PayPal, we are also always looking to acquire innovative companies that can bring great product experiences and technology talent to PayPal like we delivered entering, Venmo, Paydiant and Xoom. In the first quarter we announced our agreement to acquire Tio Networks which will expand our two-sided network by adding bill payment is another key service to drive engagement and value to our consumers. On April 10th Tio shareholders approved our transaction and we expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2017. Tio is a leading multichannel bill payment processor in North America and processed more than 7 billion in bill payment in its fiscal 2016. The company\u2019s digital platform and physical network of agent location make paying bill simpler, faster and more affordable. And importantly, gift consumers may not have access to digital financial services, the ability to easily migrate cash into a digital network and as a result benefit from the convenience and speed of digital bill payments. With its network of 10,000 supported billers, Tio will meaningfully expand our ability to offer digital financial services to tens of millions of underserved consumers. Reinventing the management and movement of money for people across the global creates opportunities for close partnerships with companies across our ecosystem. We continue to strengthen and forge additional strategic alliances with leading brands around the world. We just announced the partnership agreement with Wells Fargo, adding another strategic issuer to the growing list of companies working with PayPal to expand our services at the point of sale. As a result of this partnership Wells Fargo customers will be able to use their debit and credit cards to make contactless mobile payments at millions in store merchants. This expands our longstanding relationship with Wells Fargo and build on the product capabilities. These are made available to PayPal as part of our strategic partnership. We also extended our partnership with Visa into the Asia-Pacific region and in January we finalized a comprehensive strategic partnership with Discover. Along with Citi and FIS, these partnerships will make it easier for PayPal customers to find and choose the preferred financial instruments inside the PayPal Wallet and use the PayPal account in multiple context. Our conversations with other leading issuers continue to be positive and constructive. Over the past nine months we have rolled out consumer choice against across our on boarding, servicing and checkout experiences. Multiple millions of our consumers have already opted into choice and have formatted the payment option best suited for their particular checkout experience. Consequently, we now have additional visibility into the early results of choice and we are quite pleased that what we are seeing. First, choice is having a notable positive impact on our net active adds. Second, it is driving higher spend per customer. Third, we are experience a reduction across into our customer service centers leading to cost reductions in our global operations. And finally, the impact of choice on our transaction margins is well within our expectations. In summary, we couldn\u2019t happier with our strategic move to choice and the corresponding benefits we are seeing. We plan to rollout choice in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, beginning in Q2. We also announced a meaningful expansion of our growing relationship with Google. PayPal will be available within Android pay in United States and will be accepted as a way to pay both in app and at the millions of retailers that accept Android pay at the point of sale. We are pleased to offer our customers another exciting way to pay with PayPal further expanding the choices and context within which they can use their PayPal Wallet. We expect that our relationships with technology companies like Google and Facebook will continue to grow and expand into additional context as we move through the next several quarters. 2017 continues the strong efforts we have undertaken to create strategic partnerships across multiple ecosystems. We have seen the transformative power of these partnerships across our business. It\u2019s hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across the multiple sectors who were previously viewed as potential competitors. We are now collaborating a strong and supportive allies to create value for our mutual customers. As this quarter\u2019s results clearly demonstrate we are executing against our vision in a disciplined fashion. We operate one of world\u2019s most exciting and dynamic industry which energizes and inspires our entire team. We still have much to accomplish, but I would like to take a moment and thank the entire PayPal team for another quarter of dedication and hard work on behalf of our customers. It is making a real difference in the value we can drive to consumers, merchants and to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal\u2019s customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great year. We outperformed in the first quarter on both revenue and earnings, building on our momentum for 2016. Solid growth across active accounts, payment volumes and revenue demonstrates that our customer first strategy coupled with our strategic partnerships are yielding results. Before I go into the detail financial results, a few highlights for the quarter, revenue was $2.98 billion, growing 17% on a spot basis and 19% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS grew 19% to $0.44. We generated $751 million of operating cash flow and $603 million of free cash flow and we returned $517 million to shareholders during the quarter. For the first quarter, our total payment volume was $99 billion, up 25% on a currency neutral basis, including U.S. payment volume growth of 27% and international volume growth of 23%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $84 billion. Merchant services represent approximately 85% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented approximately 15% of the total compared to 16% in the prior quarter and 18% in the first quarter of 2016. In the first quarter, we added 5 million net new active accounts, ending with 203 million active accounts, representing growth of 11% from Q1 last year. Active account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal core business. The number of payment transactions per active accounts increased 12% year-over-year, continued solid growth of customer engagement in active accounts resulted in a 23% year-over-year increase in payment transactions to $1.7 million.  In the first quarter 17% revenue growth resulted from a 60% in transaction revenue and a 23% increase in revenue from other value added services. Transaction revenue was driven by core PayPal and Braintree businesses and revenue from other value added services was predominantly driven by credit. For Q1 our total take rate was 3% and our transaction take rate was 2.62%, both of these metrics reflect sequentially and down approximately 14 basis points from a year ago. Continuing a trend, our P2P businesses contributed meaningful in take rate decline in the quarter. Again, I would like to point out the growth in our Venmo and our core P2P platform increases our ubiquity, strengthens our value proposition and support higher levels of engagement and reduce levels of churn across our consumer base. These businesses are important to our long-term success and we remain committed to both investing it and monetizing these high growth opportunities. Our volume based expenses were up 28% year-over-year. Transaction expense was $987 million, up 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by increase funding cost across our core PayPal platform, as well as business mix from strong growth in Braintree. On choice we are in the process of rolling this experience to all of our customers here in U.S. and as Dan articulated, we are pleased with the early success of this initiative. To date, the increase card based cost have been well within our expectation. Transaction loss in the quarter was $171 million or 5.7% of revenue, representing 40 basis points of leverage. In the quarter loan losses for both the consumer and merchant credit finance were $129 million or 4.3% of revenue. Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge-off rate was 6.9% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivable balance including both principle and interest of $5.7 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolio and a total reserve of $360 million. Other operating expenses increased 4.5% to $1.05 billion or 35% of total revenue, representing 420 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year. This marks the lowest favored growth in operating expenses that we achieved as an independent company. We are very encouraged by the early progress of our initiatives to operate more efficiently. Looking forward we will continue to seek opportunities to drive sustainable efficiencies and cost discipline, while at the same time foster innovation, reducing complexity in our processes and improving our service to our customers. We are positioning PayPal to operate and scale more profitably over the long-term. Associated with these initiatives we recognize a $14 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, primarily related to strategic headcount reductions across our global organization. Less than 3% of our global work force will be affected and based on current plans we do not expect a net decrease in headcount for the year. We expect to realize annualized savings of approximately $75 million, of that majority of which will be reinvested in our growth initiatives. We believe the changes we are making to how we are organize and how we run the business will allow us to deliver sustainably stronger results. Non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter was 21.6%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the same period last year. This is our best operating margin performance since separation. In addition, non-GAAP operating income grew 20% year-over-year to $643 million, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 in the quarter. I would now like to spend a moment discussing how changes in foreign currency impacted our results in the quarter. While we recognize hedge gains of $40 million in the first quarter, these gains were more than offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. The effect of translation net of our hedge gains created revenue headwind of approximately $16 million. Our hedging program is decided to minimize the operating income effect from changes in the currencies to which we have the largest exposure. On an operating income basis, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates were immaterial to our results in the quarter. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion. We generated $751 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $148 million or 5% of revenue, resulting in $603 million of free cash flow in the quarter, representing $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. In addition to an already strong balance sheet, our balance generates substantial free cash flow. Effective capital allocation is an additional leverage to drive long-term value creation. We take a comprehensive view of our sources and uses of cash to ensure that we allocate resources and capital to what we consider to be the highest return on alternatives. We are fortunate and we have many great options for the use of our free cash flow. Part of that is how we deploy the capital on our balance sheet to highest returning investments. We currently have $5.1 billion of consumer credit receivables on our balance sheet and are exploring different options including asset sales and partnership opportunities to free up cash for higher returning investments. In the first quarter, we returned $517 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $500 million remaining on our buyback authorization further reinforcing our ongoing commitment to capital return and discipline capital allocation. Today we are announcing a new buyback authorization in the amount of $5 billion. We are confident that the cash generated potential of our business will continue to allow us to invest organically, be equatative and return cash to shareholders. We are pleased that we are positioned to increase the repurchase authorization and view this as the next step in providing a more comprehensive longer range plan for capital allocation. Consistent with the execution of our existing authorization we plan to repurchase share to offset the dilution from stock based compensation and use the remainder for opportunistic repurchases. I would now like to discuss our guidance for the second and updated guidance for the full year 2017. For the full year, we are ranging our revenue guidance and now expect revenue between $12.52 billion and $12.72 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 17% to 19%. We are pleased that raising this outlook relative to the guidance that provided in January because of the momentum you are seeing across our business and initiatives. At current exchange rates for the full year we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 200 basis points, resulting in spot growth of 15% to 17%. We are also raising our full year EPS number and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of a $1.74 to $1.79. We expect the sequential trends in our quarterly revenues and earnings to be very similar to 2016. For the second quarter we expect revenue to be between $3.05 billion and $3.1 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.41 and $0.43. In closing we have started 2017 from a position of strength. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, executed successfully across our plans and achieve important goals both operationally and financially. We see substantial opportunity in the markets we are currently serving and those that are part our longer term addressable market. We will continue expand and build on our market leadership position and remain focus on balancing investments in growth with profitability and discipline capital management, creating shareholder value for the long-term. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Darrin Pellar from Barclays. Your line is now open. Darrin Pellar : Thanks guys. Thanks John. Just \u2013 it\u2019s great to see more operating leverage in the model, just wanted to be clear first, John, the $40 million in restructuring is more one-time nature? And then, perhaps, you can give us a bit more detail moves you are making to improve that operating expense growth, I think, you mentioned, you said 5% in other expense, where can that get you here, I mean, clearly showing more of the past due in operating leverage this quarter than in the past? Thanks. John Rainey : Yes. Thanks, Darrin. Good question both. The $40 million restructuring charge is a result of a very targeted initiative here which actually goes into your second quarter that is really design to help us move forward in a very efficient manner as we scale our business. It is not what I would describe as your typical headcount reduction. It\u2019s a target reduction that really drives towards the efficiency of the business and in doing so is in a very customer centric fashion. So we don\u2019t expect that in the future necessarily that\u2019s one-time effect. With respect to operating leverage, you are right, you could go back and look at the last several quarters and you have seen sequential declines in our operating expense growth rate each of those quarters. And to your point we grew 4.5% this quarter and even if you look at that on kind of an incremental margin basis, for every dollar of revenue that we brought in this quarter our operating expenses increased $0.10 and that\u2019s the best performance that we have ever seen as a company. You can go back to prior years and that number would have been as high as $0.50 in some cases. So this is a demonstration of how we are going to operate moving forward and it really is across all aspects of our business. It\u2019s not specific to what you may think of generally as overhead. It\u2019s how build sales group and product development. How we build our product. How we sell to our customer. So it\u2019s a muscle that we are developing and we certainly hope that we can share more of these results going forward. Darrin Pellar : All right. Nice job guys. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you for the results. Just want to ask on the acceleration in active accounts and also in the U.S. payment volume metric looks like acceleration as well, is that the result of the customer choice or there are other factors to consider, just trying to segregate customer choice from the rest of the business if possible? Dan Schulman : Yes. Tien-tsin, thanks for the question. I think, there are a couple of things that drove overall results. And I think one of the things is au (3144) around these things. It is the result of cumulative effect of lots of actions that we have been taking. Certainly, customer choice is being very helpful. We are seeing not only increase on board \u2013 on boarding is more streamlined but reduction in churn, which to me is a great checkmate for what we were trying to do with the choice. But that\u2019s still early days on that. We are really seeing momentum across all regions right now. I think a lot of that is because over the past 18 to 24 months Bill and his team, the risk teams others around the company have really looked at our core value proposition. Things that you may not think about like availability and performance of our network are up time. We spent a tremendous amount of energy and resource to make sure that our platforms perform the way that our customers expect for us. We obviously couldn\u2019t think like One Touch. One Touch is driving more engagement. More engagement typically means with our churn, which is held for on our net adds. I think, if you look at our noble performance and it\u2019s arguable that we are only not global checkout experience right now. I look at things like our consumer app we put out, the merchant app we put out, new invoicing things, smaller things have the ability to recover passwords more easily, all of these things are starting to hit in the marketplace in quite impactful way. And I would say we are just beginning on this as well. I mean, if you think about choice for the first time, we are actually beginning to see banks that, we have even mentioned in our remarks, our press announcements that our marketing pays off to their consumers because if they can put their debt or credit into the PayPal Wallet, they know they are going to drive additional digital spend by doing that. We have a lot more that we have got planned in the funnel whether that\u2019s additional functionality for Venmo users, whether that\u2019s international expansion, upticks in our consumer value proposition or all of the things we are doing with multiple partners across world, that\u2019s also helping to drive our net adds. So as I mentioned in our remarks, we are now expecting more than 20 million net adds for the year since substantial step up from where we are and hopefully we will continue to see that momentum moving forward. We are certainly encourage by what we are seeing. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Hey, guys. Solid results. Just kind of a two part question, I guess, what came in better than previous guidance that cause the revenue and EPS guidance raise from fiscal year \u201917? And then just secondly on the Android paid partnership announcement, that seems like a unique deal. My understanding is PayPal will generate a fee on all transactions at the point of sell regardless of tender types, so even if it is a credit card. So maybe you can help us understand the economics that PayPal earns on those transactions? Thank so much and congrats on the quarter? Dan Schulman : Thanks, Bryan. I will take the first part of the question then turn over to Bill for Android. Actually, Bryan, this is one of these quarters where we just hit on all cylinders. If you start at the top of the funnel you see that the 6 million net new adds, which is highest we have had in several years and then you walk away down, revenue came in and really all \u2013 across all regions came in better than what we have expected in core PayPal. And then as I alluded to you in my prepared remarks, we are really pleased with what we are seeing in around discipline on the cost side of the business. We have got \u2013 we just -- we are changing our way that we operate as a company and this is Bill\u2019s evolution, but we are pretty excited and then we are beginning to seeing the results of what we are capable up here. Bill Ready : Yeah. The Android pace probably just, the thing we are doing there, I mean, it\u2019s good to sort of take a step back a little bit and talk about some of the broader partnership that we are doing, be more specific your question on Android, hey Bryan is, what you are seeing happen on mobile that our two sided platform is allowing to connect consumers and merchants very efficiently across many different context and if you have seen people on ecosystem partner with us because we can help line up new experiences that they want to create for their customers and so that\u2019s across the number of partnerships that we have. With Android Pay and PayPal becoming a payment options inside of Android Pay, number one, we are going to give the consumer great ability to access mobile app to pay transactions by be able to sign up at One Touch to be able to have a friction of on boarding into that experience. We have a great customer journey into mobile app to pay. And then at the end of that the economics of that we are starting with PayPal balance only and for those we will make money on those transactions must like it would any other transaction. As we work through other payment methods we will use Visa, Mastercard tokens, tokens from other and this is one of the interesting things about deals we did there that the token that we import from Visa and Mastercard we \u2013 when we token out the estimate of an issuer, we will pass through a card present rates to the merchants, the merchant is card presently, and we only cost on those things. It also means that we are not necessarily have revenue on all those transactions, but we don\u2019t have cost either and that let us have some of our transactions where we will make good margin on those, others basically are zero revenue and zero costs for us and the benefit of that is that we can drive engagement across our consumer base and you see that\u2019s across other parts of our business where take P2P as a good example we did tremendous volume on P2P. And in many situations those are free transactions but those consumer engage with us on P2P are more engaged overall and we find that some of our most profitable customers because we have higher engagement them overall across other transactions where we monetize. And we think about in store in a very similar way, with Android Pay in similar way that we will have some of those transactions that we monetize directly, others that are pass through for us but we expect it will drive overall engagement higher as we have more and more opportunities to engage with our PayPal users. Dan Schulman : Yeah. Just to build on that a response though, one of the long-term aspirations we have with consumers is that, we first started this that they were transacting with us one to two times a month. We are now approaching almost three times a month, that\u2019s what we can say it for us that our long-term aspiration is that a PayPal consumer engagement with us one to two times a week. And as Bill mentioned, the way to do that is to be much more involve in the everyday management and movement of money of the consumer, which means that we want to give them this optionality of not only what instrument they want to use and how they want to spend, but where they want to spend. So whether that the international remittance, whether that be bill pay, whether that be a tax to pay in app or in store, we are trying to open up the PayPal Wallet through these partnership in multiple context and multiple different functions for our consumers to be much more engage with PayPal Wallet and we are beginning to see the early payoffs of that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Paul Condra : Hey, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I guess, on, just on the guidance, does that include any contribution from Venmo or Tio, just on Tio can you talk a little bit about margin profile, growth rate or anything just to help understand that, the way that business looks a little more? Thanks. John Rainey : Sure. As Dan alluded to you in his remarks, we are beginning to expand pay with Venmo and we have got some improvement in the contribution assume there, but I wouldn\u2019t by any stretch the imagination suggested aggressive or that were dependent upon that for our results this year. We are going to be measured in this as Bill has said many times before this is something where we \u2013 it\u2019s too precious to get Venmo and we want to get the experience just right. So if that requires us taking more measured approach that\u2019s absolutely fine with us. And so we are \u2013 we do expect to have daily improving economics with Venmo as we go forward. But there is not, I wouldn\u2019t describe our 2017 guidance is depending on the comp that is going to happen within that. Dan Schulman : Yeah. As I mentioned in my opening remarks on Venmo side, we are really trying to take same approach with One Touch. We have now been able to engineer our platform just like with One Touch recently got such quick merchant acceptance as the merchant have to do no work on their part to be able accept our One Touch transaction. We have that initial on Braintree with automobile customers and we tested Venmo to see I take that experience, that\u2019s a social experience of payments and move it into a social experience for purchases as well. And we now have the platform to be able to turn on PayPal merchants which obviously is the vast majority of base here in the U.S. to accept payment from Venmo as an option. And so that will roll out over the year but that will roll out more towards the back half of the year and so we will Venmo this year and as John said, we will start to see that improve as we look forward in our medium-term guidance. On Tio, Tio is a publicly traded company right now, you can see the results that did about $80 million or so last year in their past quarter, this last quarter that they just reported. Obviously, we will look at with synergies are there. We are quite excited about having Tio come in. Bill payment is a very sticky solution. We are really trying to build out how we can help underserved consumers manage and move their money and that can be done in a very profitable way for us and a very consumer friendly way for consumers as well. So we are really excited to close that acquisition. Again, we expect that to close in the second half of this. But in our overall results, it\u2019s a pretty small number in general. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Dan you mentioned like discussions with other banks continue and you have some good experiences. I guess, what\u2019s holding some other announcements up when you have your discussions with banks? And then, just one for John, as part of the asset life strategy, is there any sense of timing? Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yeah. So, Sanjay, just, we are actually announcing all of the different issuers and banks that we are working with, because we don\u2019t active, we don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t necessarily make the announcement. We don\u2019t need the announcement and so there are lot that adjusting to that end. Some of the very big ones take time to work with. That\u2019s really just take time to work through. I think there is a single conversation that we are having right now that I feel, but optimistic about that everything being done with an eye from both parties to get deal done and these are big banks. They have a unique, some of them are very unique situations and we just need to work through large different documents with each of them. We want to make sure that when we sign up with the bank that the product flows are right, that we exactly have experience right to make it as I mentioned in my remarks, mutually advantageous for our mutual customers. So, not really to read on that, just take some time to work through these things. John Rainey : Sanjay, on asset life, I want to start by reminding everyone that we have no intention to start offering a credit product. Credit today compliments a holistic suite of payment offerings that we provide for our merchants and consumers and they find great value of that. What we do want to do though is put that that credit offering in a less capital intensive manner than what we do today, so that we can free up that cash potentially as much as $5 billion for higher returning investment. We have got various options there, some are more partnerships like opportunities, others are pure asset sale, some combination of the two. Our preference that you do question on timing is to do something sooner, but we are not going to add on the side of experience that means giving a sale optimal deal for PayPal. So we are not under a self-imposed timeframe. We are going to take our time will be measured and do what is best for creating long-term shareholder value for PayPal. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good afternoon. Dan, I know you have said that you are pleased with the consumer choice results that you have seen far, but can you give us a little bit more detail around what\u2019s driving your confidence level over being able to continue to offset the increase in transaction margin compression with TPV growth and operating leverage? And John, separately for you, could we see the growth rate and other expenses turn negative for a time or is the goal just to keep other expenses growing more slowly than revenues? Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yes. Thanks for your question, Bill. So, I will just take one step back on choice. We want the choice, because we really felt that into our long-term stage to be the ultimate customer champion company focused on customers and what their pain points are, what they need that offering them optionality of how and where they want to pay, giving them flexibility and transparency and powering them with essential for us to remain the market leader in digital payments. And it also had the benefit which was great, enabling us to team with networks, financial institutions, carriers, tech companies to drive digital payment, we are all aligned and wanted to do that. And then remember that the partnership arrangements that we had enabled us to get certain things that we didn\u2019t have before cost certainty, elimination of digital wallet, sees what something that was hanging out in the market, we got access as Bill mentioned to industry standard tokens, card present rates. We have network volume discounts that came back to us because we obviously drive a ton of volume over the various networks and we had instant access to funds coming off of the platform which was a \u2013 today which we have in our P2P product and we fill all of those gaps with this field. So we assume right now that we are now rolled out basically into across our on boarding, a servicing and our checkout experiences. And we are not now looking at tens of thousands of data test and after test for hundreds of thousands of early adapters, we are looking at multiple millions of consumers that is opted into choice and the results we are seeing are, a frank and very pleasant as we see them. As I mentioned, we are going to see an increase in net adds and a notable part of that is going to be driven through choice and we are just beginning on that piece of it. Our order sizes are up as people can figure out, so this order allows them to use our debit or credit cards, this transaction they wanted to use their ACH or debit card. And so people can now talk about for in fact nearly it\u2019s those who use PayPal less to finding the most value in choice right now and that is driving engagement and higher order sizes and we see our cost coming down as we expected, because people were confused about funding choices and we expected a reduction of course coming in the call center and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing and that\u2019s sustainable cost reductions for us. And then the transaction costs are well within the expectation, so we have well within that and so we had model all of these reasonably conservatively what we looked at our guidance and our medium-term guidance and all of them. We are quite pleased by what we are seeing and we are just getting start the marketing for the banks. In fact that we get additional funding options coming in like rewards points that will start to come in early next year as our another funding mechanism, all of these things are sort of begin early days on choice, but we were always sure that over the long-term this would make sense for us, we are frankly see any playing out much earlier than we expected. John Rainey : Hey, Bill, the second part of your question, in terms of whether we would expect to see OpEx turn negative. I would reemphasis that this is not a one-time cost take out approach on cost. We are reengineering the way we work and so from one quarter to the next we certainly have seasonality in our business we may invest more in certain quarters versus other quarters, but at the end of day we are growth company and we are going to continue to add cost, where we think it generates value for us. And we don\u2019t overly rotate towards one metric like other operating expense or like transaction margin, the thing that drives us is being a customer champion and create shareholder value and so we are going to make decision whether it would be around revenue or costs that we think results in strong performance in both of those metrics. Dan Schulman : I would say, senior leader shifting though, there has been a tremendous amount of focus kind of how we do that in a way that enables us to make decisions quickly, to innovate more rapidly, to do so in a much more efficient way and so when you think about costs, this is not necessarily taking cost out but it\u2019s eliminating cost. So for instant in global ops, our global ops growth least than that that it has come forward. The reason for that is predominantly caller statement. That means calls are not coming in our customer care, because our product experience is better, since we have choice and so those are sustainable benefits that we have as a result of actions we are taking that and we are very focused on being both \u2013 focus on what customer pain points are. How we solve it. How we keep our lead in the marketplace that are operating in very efficient and effective way. John Rainey : And Bill, I would add to that, maybe a better to think about the cost trajectory going forward with other operating expense is mid-single digits growth. Bill Carcache : Great. Thank you both for the very detailed responses. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Dan Schulman : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks. Hi, Dan, John, Bill. Solid quarter. Congratulations on that. My question is, now we have had obviously a number of initiatives one is consumer choice, you both acquired Xoom, contextual commerce, almost then sort of a kind of design to increase the size of the funnel, you draw more transactions and accounts on to the PayPal platform, you are having good payment now, banking other relationships. I guess, the question becomes, are you done buildings, what you could be building in terms of pulling transactions in, it become an execution story from now on, is that, I mean, what else could you be adding to the platform here strategically? Bill Ready : Hi, Ashwin, it\u2019s Bill. One other things we really think a lot about is, how rapidly the consumer is moving into new context with MA transact and the interesting thing about PayPal, we talked about this the previously, it will really make PayPal is that we are one of the only player to operate on both the consumer merchant side of the payment ecosystem. They will do so globally and control the experience end-to-end. And so what that means is that, every time consumer emerge they start to meet one and another in new context or consumers want to transact in the new context. We are able to light those up often times in far better late than what others could. And so on one hand, we \u2013 our cost are looking how we evolve the platform to make sure that as those new context emerge that we can serve customers. However, we have a structural difference in our company that naturally allows us to be a primary player, enabling those transactions, because of the way that we operate on both the consumer and merchant side of the payment ecosystem and in fact that we can do so globally and control end-to-end experiences. And I think you see that happening in what\u2019s going on in the ecosystem that you see in terms of mobile commerce, at 32 billion dollars in volume this quarter, more than $100 billion last year and what we are doing with the One Touch rollout and with 5 million plus merchants and 75% IRR 100, you are seeing that increasingly, our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystem are looking at us as the preferred partner to light up these types of experience for them. So your question was around how much we are building, we continue to think on building for those new contexts, but we also have our platform is really set up to be a great way to connect consumers and merchants whenever they meet one another in new context. And then some of those specifically where on the consumer side, Dan, talks a lot about things that we want to do and become a part of the way people manage and move their money every day. Those are places where we are just beginning our endeavors and look at the kind of growth, and Dan touched how we are approaching three transactions a month, while we had great growth overall. We think there is so much more of the consumers overall experience and we can help them with and the industry is moving toward us, that you have seen more and more transactions are moving towards e-commerce and to mobile and we are increasingly a preferred partner to our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystems as that happens. Dan Schulman : I just like to add to that, if you think about the merchant side and you think about our strategy around the merchant side, as we move fundamentally over the last three or four years from predominantly being a button on our website to really now being a fundamental underlying platform provider to merchants as they think about how did they take advantage of mobile and that means that we are offering a host of services across a common platform that we never did before. Full checkout type of capabilities, credit capabilities, contextual commerce toolsets, rewards integration through API sets and the list goes on and on and so invoicing capabilities. So if you think about the mission of PayPal of both on the consumer side as Bill just articulated and on the merchant side. It is a much more expansive mission and vision than we have ever had before and so I think that we obviously can grow in a couple of different ways going forward and this is fully what we expect. One is we are going cross sell more products and services to existing customers. We have a whole suite both on the consumer side and on the merchant side and we can tremendously expand the amount of services we provide to each and every customer. Second thing though is we are just beginning on this journey here. We are beginning to see acceleration of our net ads coming consumers are beginning to recognize sort of network effect and we have merchants are beginning to see that and we have huge international expansion opportunities which is better performance and we can do on that side. So it\u2019s not just a matter of due coming in, it\u2019s a matter of taking what we have and be able to cross sell into existing as well. So that sort of combination of this two things, time gives us a lot of excitement about our growth prospect as we look forward. Operator : And we have time for one last question from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is now open. James Cakmak : Hi. Thanks. Just one quick one, does your guidance contemplate any kind of incremental marketing expense build awareness on the pay with Venmo side as we progress with that. I guess is the look towards at the end of year is what? Dan Schulman : Hi, James, thanks for the question. First of all, I think, one of the areas that as we have seen a bunch of fundamental really efficiency and improvement is in our whole marketing spend. We took what we are previously very desperate marketing functions in each of our regions either in headquarters, we put them all together and that group is both regions and I think central looking at our spend, figuring out how do we spend that in the most efficient manner. We have ton of data and analytics around if you look at things both through an ROI perspective and we are not just more efficient but way more effective on our marketing spend and I can\u2019t say enough good things about what that team has done. And by being more efficient we are actually getting more spend out of the existing dollars that we have. With pay Venmo for all of our growth initiatives, you heard John talk about we are going to take the money that we are saving and reinvest it back into our group initiatives, pay with Venmo where we a part of that that gets additional investment for us. John Rainey : Yeah. I would just add to that, while, as just Dan mentioned, we have great efficiency around marketing and billing considering the ability to assist, pay within what\u2019s marketing, the $6.8 million a month we did in the quarter and 114% year-over-year growth came with almost no marketing for Venmo. It\u2019s a product that have been inherently viral and so we certainly think about how we will support the product going forward, but it is a great place to be when you have a product that customers truly love and is inherently viral and grows without having to go through tons of marketing dollars added and so that is something we think about with that as we build pay with Venmo the social aspect of that we have kept very much at the core of what we are doing and we think that can really help to build upon the virality of the core product. So it\u2019s not a product that we have to go support with massive amounts of marketing. It\u2019s a product that is inherently viral and that we can complement with couple marketing. James Cakmak : Yeah. Great. Dan Schulman : So, James, thank you for that question. And thank you to everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

And welcome to PayPal\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures and talking about our company\u2019s performance. In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma measures because we believe that these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the Company\u2019s performance across different periods. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Please note that as reflected in the reconciliation our GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income in the press release is included in our 8-K filed earlier this afternoon, GAAP diluted net income per share for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.56. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2017. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, July 26, 2017. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle. And thanks everyone for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to say that PayPal delivered another strong quarter of financial results, achieving new milestones for the Company on multiple fronts. PayPal generated 3.136 billion in revenue, the first time we've exceeded 3 billion in a single quarter and representing 20% of FX-neutral growth, nearly a 110 basis point acceleration from the first quarter and 70 basis points from a year ago. We've exceeded our guidance and delivered $0.46 of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, up 27% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin grew by a 110 basis point year-over-year to 21%. We generated 747 million in free cash flow, up 51% from a year ago. Perhaps more importantly we had strong performance across our customer metrics. We gained 6.5 million net new active accounts, the largest organic quarterly gain in the past three years and up over 80% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with 210 million active accounts including 17 million merchant accounts, growing our base at 12% year-over-year. Given our first half results, we now anticipate our net new active additions will exceed 25 million for 2017. Engagement once again increased growing 10% year-over-year, our customers now transact 32.3 times per year, up from 29.4 times a year ago, and 31.7 last quarter. Our growing base and increasing customer engagement enabled us to pass another milestone, as we processed a 106 billion in payment volume exceeding 100 billion in quarterly TPV for the first time. TPV grew at a currency neutral rate of 26% year-over-year, accelerating 75 basis points from last quarter. Our volume growth was driven by our leadership in mobile. In the quarter, 34% of the payments on our platform were made on a mobile device. PayPal processed approximately 36 billion in mobile payment volume in Q2, up 50% year-over-year. This growth is largely driven by the exceptional and differentiated consumer experiences we enabled on mobile devices. One Touch adoption continued to expand in the quarter with over 60 million consumer accounts opted in. Merchant accounts accepting One Touch now numbered just over 5.5 million growing by 500,000 in the quarter. Venmo users sent and received 8 billion in the second quarter representing a 103% increase from this time last year, as we continue to achieve increasing network effects in the millennial markets. Based on the strong trends we're seeing across the business, we're once again raising guidance for revenue and EPS for the full year. John will share more details about our results and guidance in his remarks. Our performance is driven by the cumulative effect of multiple incidents. We have fundamentally retooled our technology and infrastructure, leading to significant improvements and availability and develop our productivity. We have meaningfully improved our core experiences and expanded our suite of products. Our overall scale is accelerating due to the network effects of our two sided platform. It is clearly a macro secular shift toward digital payments and our customer choice results continue to exceed our expectations. We have completed a rollout of choice across our on-boarding, servicing and checkout experiences in the United States and over 13 million customers have opted into choice. We have the data from millions of customers over multiple quarters. We are beginning to see clear trends resulting from our choice initiative. Choice is both simplify and clarify our customer experiences, which has meaningfully reduced the volume of calls into our customer service centers. Despite our transaction volumes increasing by more than 20%, our net call volume into our global operations are down year-over-year. The results of choice on the numerous other product improvements, we delivered significant OpEx savings over the course of our three-year finding horizon. More importantly, customers who have opted into choice have meaningful increases in overall satisfaction. As a result, choice is driving a significant reduction in churn and a meaningful lift in overall engagement. And consistent with last quarter, the impact on our funding cost continues to remain well within our expectations. Based on the success of choice in the U.S., we are pleased to be expanding this rollout into Australia, Canada, The UK and Japan later this year. Choice will also help to expand PayPal's presence in our customers' lives. These opportunities are driven by the land mark partnership agreements we have announced with technology companies, financial networks, wireless carriers and financial institutions around the world. In the second quarter, we continue to make excellent progress with our partnerships. We continue to expand our relationship with Visa, expanding our partnership in the Europe. As most of you will recall, last quarter, we announced an agreement with Visa that covered the Asia-Pacific region. Consequently, we now work around the globe with Visa. And as part of our network agreement announced last year with Visa and Mastercard, we recently announced the new service as it designed to allow PayPal and Venmo users in the U.S. to instantly transfer money to their bank account via eligible debit card, linked to their PayPal account. Findings faster and more convenient ways for our customers to fund into and out of their PayPal accounts is a key part of our overall value proposition. Throughout the quarter, we saw a relationship with issuers grow increasingly collaborative and productive. For example, we are pleased to see leading issuers including Wells Fargo and HSBC actively marketing PayPal to their customer base, encouraging their clients to link their cards into PayPal accounts. We also announced new strategic relationships with JPMorgan Chase and as of today Bank of America to utilize their token services and enable their customers to easily integrate their cards into PayPal and seamlessly create a new PayPal account from their properties. Furthermore, as part of our expanded relationship with Citi and Chase, we will make Citi ThankYou Rewards Points and Chase Ultimate Reward Points available in our PayPal wallet to be used as a funding source for consumers shopping at our 17 million merchants. As I've said on last quarter's call, it's hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across multiple sectors to many once view as potential competitors. We are confident these partnerships will drive enhanced value to our mutual customers. The accelerating and extensive scale of our two sided global platform, which will allow consumers and merchants to transact instantly in new context, across operating system, technologies and platforms, create a strong foundation and is very attractive to multiple partners. Our open technology platform has enabled expanded partnerships with Google, Apple, Facebook and Samsung over the past few months. These agreements benefit both PayPal and our partners by creating innovative consumer-focused experiences that connect their combined billions of consumers to new buying experiences enabled by PayPal's powerful platform. In April, Google announced an expansion of our partnership to make it easy for consumers to use PayPal as a payment method in Android Pay wherever it is accepted, in-store, in app and online. In addition, Android Pay users on Google's Chrome mobile-web will be able to seamlessly pay at the millions of online merchants that accept PayPal, simply by using their PayPal account and fingerprint authentication. Just like the deployment of One Touch, this great new checkout experience will be available to millions of PayPal merchants without requiring any integration work from the merchant, further extending the value we bring to our merchant customers. Also in the quarter, Facebook announced additional commerce experiences with PayPal that will be available within its Messenger platform. At F8 Facebook shared that over 1 million joint PayPal and Facebook customers have already enabled our payments experience within Facebook Messenger. Earlier this month, PayPal and Apple announced an expansion of our iTunes integration, which mean customers can now buy games, music, movies and in-app purchases with PayPal, on their iPhones and iPads in the Apple App Store, iBooks, Apple Music and iTunes stores in 12 countries including the U.S., Australia and parts of Europe. We anticipate that this integration will expand to more countries around the world in the coming months. This complements our existing integration into Siri and Apple iMessage and marks a growing relationship with Apple. Finally, we announced a strategic partnership with Samsung. Users of Samsung Pay in the U.S. will be able to use PayPal to pay for purchases in-stores using Samsung Pay's mag-stripe emulation technology, which is used at the vast majority of merchants that accept cards. The totality of these partnerships reinforces the fact that we're becoming an underlying open payments platform and wallet for many of the leading technology platform, OEMs and wireless carriers around the world. We continue to make good progress in rolling out Venmo as a payment option for PayPal merchants. As we shared last quarter, we're not introducing the ability for U.S. PayPal merchants to accept Venmo as a mobile payment option. Venmo users are now able to use Venmo at an expanded number of PayPal merchants such as lululemon and Forever 21 and I'm quite encouraged by the early results. We expect that the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely deployed across millions of our PayPal merchants by the end of this year and I look forward to sharing more details in the coming quarters. The ability to deliver new consumers and enhanced sales growth to merchants of all sizes is a key benefit of PayPal, especially as the world becomes more global and increasingly digital. As of today, this includes bringing the power and reach of the PayPal platform to the expansive and rapidly growing Chinese consumer market. We're very pleased to announce that PayPal has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Baidu, the leading Chinese language internet search provider with approximately 700 million users. This partnership allows Chinese consumers to pay with their Baidu Wallet and PayPal at our merchants outside of China. Beginning later this year, this partnership will provide Chinese consumers more ways to discover and buy from PayPal merchants in the U.S. and will eventually expand the PayPal's entire global merchant base outside of China. We expect this partnership to drive significant demand and additional cross-border trade over the PayPal platform. In addition in helping our merchant customers maximize their opportunities in the age of digital commerce, another key part of our strategy is helping underserved consumers, join and thrive in the digital economy. This vision drove our recent acquisition of TIO Networks, which adds bill pay functionality to our two sided platform, offering consumers the ability to access a digital network and benefit from the convenience and speed of digital bill payments. Last week, we announced that we have closed our acquisition of TIO Network and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Hamed and the TIO team to the PayPal family. Three years ago, we set off to transform PayPal. Our goal is to create an open platform for digital commerce to deliver innovative mobile checkout experiences that blur the lines between physical, online and mobile shopping. We set off to create an integrated suite of services, experiences and APIs that could extend the power of our two sided ecosystem, to our merchants with a little and I'd say no integration work required. That vision has grown increasingly important to our merchants in today's rapidly evolving retail landscape. Our execution in support of that vision is yielding strong results and expanding our leadership position. Our efforts to place our customers' frontend centered everything we do is driving the scale and engagement on our platform. It has opened the door to strategic and reductive partnerships that have extended the PayPal experience across multiple contexts in existing and new geographies. But we know we are still in the early stages of our transformation and we are just scratching the surface of the opportunities in front of us. We are fully committed to delivering a true core experiences and additional innovative and comprehensive solutions for our customers, helping our consumers and merchants to navigate the rapidly evolving and expanding digital payments landscape. And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal\u2019s customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great year. As Dan discussed, we achieved several notable milestones in the second quarter, including for the first time processing more with $100 billion of TPV and generating more than $3 billion of revenue in a quarter. In addition, we saw accelerating growth in customer accounts, revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and free cash flow. Our second quarter financial and operating results demonstrate a momentum in our business and build on the strength of our recent performance. Relative to our expectations go into the quarter, our revenue and operating income outperformed. On the top line, we attributed acceleration in our core to strong account engagement growth, enhanced user experiences that make setting preferences and choosing funding instruments intuitive, cross border initiatives as well as increased functionality that allows our customers to use our products and additional contacts. In addition, the foreign exchange rates continue to be a headwind in comparison to last year. It provided a benefit relative to our plans going into the quarter. On the expense side, non-volume related expenses grew 4.5%, approximately 25% of the rate of revenue growth. Our team did an outstanding job managing cost, resulting in cost performance slightly better than our expectations. At the same time, we continue to fully fund our key growth initiatives. This level of expense growth demonstrates our ability to scale with minimal incremental cost. Before I discuss the financial results in details here are some highlights for the quarter. Revenue was $3.14 billion, growing 18% on spot basis and 20% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP operating income grew 25% to $659 million and non-GAAP EPS grew 27% to $0.46. We generated $921 million operating cash flow and free cash flow grew 51% to $747 million. For the second quarter, our total payment volume was $106 billion up 26% on a currency neutral basis consisting of U.S. payment volume growth of 27% and international volume growth of 25%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $91 billion. Merchant services represented approximately 86% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented approximately 14% of the total compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2017 and 17% in the second quarter of 2016. P2P continues to be a meaningful contributor TPV, representing approximately 21% of total payment volume. In the quarter, active accounts grew 12% and we ended the second quarter with 210 million active accounts. Active account growth was driven by strength in our core PayPal business as well as growth in Venmo. The number of payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12 month basis reached 32.3 with 6.8 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. In the second quarter, transactions grew 23% to 1.8 billion. Revenue grew 18% on a spot basis in Q2 and was the result of an 18% increase in both transaction revenue and revenue from other value-added services. The revenue growth in the second quarter represents an acceleration of more than 100 basis points versus the first quarter. Transaction revenue growth was primarily driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses and revenue from other value-added services was predominantly driven by credit. For Q2, our transaction take rate was 2.58%, a decline of 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2016. And our total take rate was 2.95% down 13 basis points year over year. 75% of the decrease in both transaction and total take rate was related to the increase in our P2P volume. Increased stability in our transaction take rate in the second quarter is indicative of the balanced growth and the strength we are seeing across our platform as well as our ability to monetize experiences where we demonstrate a compelling value proposition for our customers. Volume based expenses were up 29% year over year. Transaction expense was $1.06 billion, up 31% year over year driven primarily by increased funding cost across our core PayPal platform. As Dan mentioned in his remarks, the increased transaction expenses we have seen from choice have been well within our expectations. Further, we continue to see benefit on both the top line as well as cost improvements from lower customer call volumes in servicing costs, validating our initial expectations. We're pleased to roll out these experiences to additional geographies in Europe and Asia. Transaction loss in the quarter was $185 million or 17 basis points of TPV compared to 18 basis points of TPV in Q2 '16. Low losses across our consumer and merchant credit products were a $123 million, representing 26% growth in line with the growth of our receivables portfolio. Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge off rate was 6.9% in second quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivable balance including both principle and interest of $6.1 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolio and our total reserve of $380 million. Other operating expenses increased 4.5% to $1.1 billion representing 35% of total revenue, an improvement of 465 basis points of operating leverage versus the same quarter last year. Both general and administrative and product development costs were flat year-over-year and experienced the lowest rates of growth since separation. Sales and marketing expenses grew 10 as we invested to support our brand strategies and choice experiences. For the second quarter in a row, other operating expenses increased only $0.10 for every incremental dollar of revenue, demonstrating the scalability of our platform. Strong revenue and cost performance resulted in 25% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $659 million. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21% compared to Q2 '16. GAAP operating income grew 16% in the second quarter to $430 million and resulted in a GAAP operating margin of 13.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS grew 27% in the second quarter to $0.34 and $0.46 respectively. We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.4 billion. We generated $921 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and capital expenditures were $174 million or 6% of revenue. This resulted in $747 million of free cash flow in the quarter as we generated $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Capital return is a fundamental component of our overall capital allocation strategy. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $600 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $400 million remaining on our original $2 billion authorization. As announced on our last earnings call, our Board has also approved an additional $5 billion buyback authorization. In addition to focusing on enhanced capital allocation strategies, we're also committed to optimizing our capital structure. As we've shared over the past few quarters, we're exploring alternatives to run our consumer credit business in a less capital intensive manner. We're encouraged by the discussions with potential partners and based on the progress we're making the timing and structure of these alternatives are in line with our expectations. While we continue to assess more efficiently to manage balance sheet exposure and consumer credit, we are also assessing strategies that will support the growth of merchants and credit products. We continue to introduce and expand financial services and tools, have small and mid size business customers, start and grow the businesses. Since 2013, PayPal working capital has provided in excess of $3 billion in funding to more than 115,000 merchants. PayPal working capital is a strategic offering for PayPal which drives merchants' sales growth, increases processing volume and reduces merchant churn rate. We will continue to invest in our working capital business to provide innovative financial products to small-and medium-sized businesses. I would now like to discuss our updated guidance for the full year 2017 as well as the guidance for the third quarter. For the full year, we are raising our revenue guidance and now expect revenue between $12.775 billion and $12.875 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 19% to 20%. At current exchange rates for the full year, we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in spot growth of 18% to 19%. For the first half of 2017, non-volume related expenses have grown only 4.5%. We are pleased with this performance and it's indicative of the type of cost discipline with which we can operate going forward. This level of growth for our non-volume related expense is sustainable given the manner in which we are scaling our business and the changes we have made to our organization structure. At the same time, this vary measured approach to experience growth gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic and make investments to drive our business going forward. Given our year-to-date performance and our operating plans for the remainder of the year, we expect with our full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand relative to 2016. We are also raising our full year EPS outlook by $0.05 at the high end and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.80 to a $1.84. Further, we are increasing our free cash flow outlook and now expect to generate in excess of $2.9 billion in 2017. As Dan mentioned, we recently closed our acquisition of TIO Network and have included and expected impact of $25 million in revenue for the remainder of the year and our full year outlook with a negligible impact to our earnings. At the high end of the ranges we are providing today, our current full year guidance represents an increase of $225 million in revenue, and a $0.10 increase in non-GAAP EPS relative to the initial full year 2017 guidance that we have provided in the January. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.14 billion and $3.19 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.42 and $0.44. I want to close with the few observations on the quarter and our full year outlook. We saw accelerating growth across net new actives, TPV and revenue in the quarter. Net new active accounts grew by 80% and our currency neutral basis TPV grew 26% and revenue increased 20%. Our merchant services growth has been consistently in the 30% and demonstrates we are continuing to grow on market share. And while growing our top-line, we expect to maintain disciplined expense growth which allowed us to deliver with 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the quarter. This performance gives us great conviction and our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Daniel Perlin : I had a question around the payment transactions for active account. I know they were up 10% and that\u2019s still a very strong number. It was down a little bit relative to last quarter. I think it was up 12 and then over the last six quarters prior to that, it was up on average 13%. So I would have thought given choice in all of the kind of reduced friction that you guys have had that you might actually see that number accelerating as opposed to decelerating in its growth. Is there any callouts in the quarter we should know about? Dan Schulman : Dan, it\u2019s Dan on. Nice to hear you and thanks for the question. So I am quite pleased with our progress on engagement. It is up 10% despite really what is an accelerating day right now which is kind of the high-class to have. We are seeing tremendous adoptions across merchants and consumers into the PayPal franchise. As I mentioned, we think we\u2019ll exceed 25 million net new actives for the year. In past couple of years, we\u2019ve taken our active user engagement up almost seven transactions per user across the whole days. And if you look under the covers what we\u2019ve done here quite a bit, the news is even better because the majority of our user engagement right now is coming from the core PayPal Wallet and in many prices before it was coming from growth of Braintree and core PayPal. But now it is being driven the majority from our PayPal core wallet and that is a great story for us. And if you look at our product growth and our core PayPal franchise over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve taken multi-year trend that have been drifting slightly down in terms of their real growth year-over-year and we have bent these curves across pretty much every single one of our core products and they're now up and accelerating. So, that is a piece of really good news that you probably wouldn\u2019t see from a number in and up itself. And it kind of feels like, we\u2019re just at the beginning of this. We've got One Touch that is driving engagement, that\u2019s driving increased engagement and it\u2019s accelerating across the base. Choice still new, but choice engagement and summing up into choice that engagement is up quite substantially, and I am really pleased with what we are seeing from choice. As I mentioned, we're about 13 million plus customers that are in choice now, that will grow and that will impact engagement. We\u2019re obviously just beginning of the journey the movements in your context. Now, we now at basically major agreements, we're pretty much every major issuer, we\u2019ve got agreement from the financial networks to utilize their tokens and those start to move us, move more an in-store environment as we go into next year, that'll also drive engagement. You got pay with Venmo. Right now, there's no engagement with Venmo, it's P2P, but we don't count that in our engagement. So also you'll see that drive up. TIO just came on. Our new partnerships with Facebook and Google are going to start to kick in, that's really not in our guidance right now, as they -- those things are going to start to accelerate and drive our future growth as we look into '18, '19, '20. So, we still have a goal that would consumer use PyaPal two times a week. That is our goal, not to drive once a week, but to drive two times a week. And I feel with all the initiatives we've right now and the trending that we're seeing that over -- our medium to long term that\u2019s within our reach too. So feeling pretty good about where we're on the engagement side. Dan Perlin : Yes, that's fantastic. I'm going to ask one more quick one is you've mentioned all these strategic partnerships and they are plentiful. I'm wondering how you're viewing that from a trend perspective to bring down your customer acquisition costs as we think about the future? Dan Schulman : You've violated first quarter rule, one question, but otherwise okay. Correlate with it and I admire that. Dan Perlin : I'm increasing my engagement. Dan Schulman : So, listen one of the things I mentioned in my opening remarks is we're beginning to see a tremendously collaborative relationship with issuers right now. We're seeing I mentioned two that are marketing to their pace to actively encourage them to link their cards into our PayPal account. And that's happening because we're going to drive growth for them, as John mentioned in his remarks, our MS TPV -- our TPV growth outside of eBay is growing at 30% and we're the perfect digital distribution channel for financial institutions especially now that we've implemented choice. And consumer will opt on how they want to pay and where they want to pay on that. And so I think this acceleration of our net new actives is coming at a lower cost to it, so it's really found sort of one-two punch that\u2019s positive for us now, but especially as we look forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Lisa Ellis : I had a question about in-store and your in-store strategy in light of the partnerships that you've signed. Can you kind of give an overall view of in which of these instances like in Android Pay versus Samsung Pay versus using the network tokens in your own wallet you're able to generate revenues for PayPal or envision that over time versus where it's just a strategy of driving more user engagement at the POS even though it's not revenue generating? John Rainey : This is a great question. And you're exactly right that as you parse of the part, there are places where we earn revenue, there're places where you think about an engagement opportunity. And so the places where somebody paying in-store and are using our PayPal balance, those are places where we would make revenue on those transactions. And places where we're enabling the use of an issuer's card directly and we're providing a pass or token, we would earn revenue on those, but we also don't have cost on those, and so we did great consumer engagement, but without cost on those transactions per se. Also importantly in addition to what we are doing with partners like Samsung Pay and Android Pay to drive into the store, we are working with those same partners, particularly Android Pay for example where it's not just in-store but that blends into in app purchasing and online purchasing. And there is a lot of blurring in the lines of online and store things like buy online, pick-up in the store where these cross channel experiences are really getting to consumers using a mobile device, but really engaging with the retailer and the store. You see us really, really delivering on those types of experience as well. So we have a broad strategy that can both help the retailer engage across the multiple front, drive engagement with the consumer and we have several those that\u2019s we monetized directly. And some of those that are going to be a path-through which would be -- we are not driving revenue across for us, but we would also not generate cost for us. We have many of those like [indiscernible] to different store, paying with your balance to reduce generate revenue on those things. And by the way, this is consistent with PayPal history where we historically have products such as P2P that were free then we've been monetizing other form. So, this is a strategy that we have employed previously and we feel very good about where we are in that. Dan Schulman : Just to add to that, we saw first [indiscernible] well and we spent a lot of time as we started the transition of the Company from being really single product type of company to being a platform company that offers a suite of services to both merchants and the consumers. And where we found and with a ton of detailed research and analytics on this is when we add an incremental service to a consumer or even to our merchants, we see the lifetime value basically double. And so a consumer adds to P2P, we see them they engaged more, their use of PayPal goes up, their churn goes way down, and it is a gigantic benefit for our flywheel and for our economics. And so, the more products and services and experiences and more engagement we could have with the consumer and a merchant, the better the LTV is for us. And that comes through us, as Bill said, historically as we have seen with P2P and others. We also start in-store with Vodafone as we go down, we have seen these. People have used Vodafone and PayPal in-store. They use PayPal more in app and online because the distinctions between those things are blurring especially with mobile. And so, our ability to engage with consumers and drive that engagement is a good thing both for consumers, for merchants and for the economics of PayPal. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar : My question is with regards to the rise in active accounts and the V acceleration of that that has gone from 10% to 11% to 12%. Is that a straightforward relationship with consumer choice? Is it possible to potentially estimate? Is there sort of untapped number of inactive accounts people who've downloaded PayPal, but didn't use it that can give us some idea of the potential to continue increasing their accounts? Dan Schulman : I'll start then maybe Bill can supplement. So, I would say and as I mentioned in my remarks, there's no one single thing driving the growth of those net new active. And as I mentioned, you know, I said I think we'll do an excess of 25 million net new active that would imply so that we're going to do another on average 6 million or so in the third and fourth quarter. So we see a continued strength in net new active. That's coming as a result and Bill won't say this, but I will from the great work that Bill and his product and engineering teams have done, great work that have done. The risk teams have done around improving our core experiences. And as I mentioned, we're bending multiyear curves now and we\u2019re seeing now really nice year-over-year growth in our core experiences. Availability just thing like availability is up, that matters a lot, we'll wait and see. It's down. That matters a lot. We got a new mobile app there. We got One Touch. We got choice coming in. Choice is driving both reduction in churn which helps to net new actives obviously, but it\u2019s also driving additional new adds because the on-boarding process is so much more streamlined, and then you also have partners that are now actively marketing PayPal because together we're sort of allies in advancing digital payments and tapping into that growth. So I think there is a number of things and we also obviously with 210 million people now on the platform, we\u2019ve got maybe at a tipping point of these network effects right now where there's so many merchants on the platforms, so many consumers on the platform, that it's a must have for people especially if they move into mobile check out experiences. I think what Bill and the risk teams have done and things like One Touch have really been an unparalleled kind of a mobile checkout experience, almost two times the conversion of the industry average. And so, I'll look at a number of things that we've done over the course of the last several years, and they're beginning to take hold in the market, and really driving our results and Bill would you answer that. Bill Ready : I think you captured really well just being the points there. We have multiple new places that customers are coming in, but as Dan described, we have across nearly every major product area, revamped those products over the last few years that we're were seeing, not only do each of those products tend to get more net new actives for us coming in. We're driving increasing engagement across each of those as people come in through those, they become more engaged on those products in those additional product that they can engage with and also even our relationship with those customers really, we have some more there -- their daily life. So, just as Dan said, it is across multiple fronts and quite noteworthy that it's across our core experiences as well as we\u2019re deepening our engagement. Dan Schulman : I'll just add one last thing and then we'll be done with your question, Ashwin. We didn't underestimate what can happen with Baidu, I mean we're now tapping into that Chinese consumer marketplace, and that is going to open up a whole new market for consumers to come on to the PayPal platform, interact with our PayPal merchants outside of China and drive what we think could be substantial cross-border traffic. And I talked about this, it's not just Baidu, it's Baidu and PayPal. So almost a little like we've done with Android Pay that it's a cobranded experience and sign up to our PayPal account from there. So, there're a lot of things that we're working on, a lot of things we still want to implement but feel good about the current trend right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : In momentum, I want to ask about maybe the partner pipeline just maybe big partnerships out there, still designing in 2017 and need to ask about the acquisition pipeline as well and your appetite to do deals? Dan Schulman : Yes, so, we've done I think 24 major partnerships in the last 18 months and you've seen it last quarter starting to accelerate actually. And it's accelerated that people are beginning to understand the assets that we bring to our partners. We obviously bring our scale to partners and when you talk to different platforms whether it'd be Baidu or Google or Samsung, the ability to tap into 17 million merchants we have that long tail of merchants, that's a very difficult asset for others to replicate and it's accelerating in its growth. If you look at other partnerships, we can add potential for pretty significant additional growth for them, whether that's driven by mobile and we can do a One Touch or TPV that's accelerating. And as you know, we also control value prop end-to-end, there're very few players who do that, there're some players that can take a piece of it, but very few players own it including risk, custom service, brand reputation. And we own all of that parts of that proposition and we've also changed our model, quite a bit, we're an open platform and a suite of service both branded and unbranded that's operating system and device and technology agnostic. And so, we're -- and very importantly, we're a neutral third party platform. So we don't compete with any of our merchants or partners who are allies in advancing digital payments. So, I think our positioning is really good within the entire ecosystem to continue to partner. There're a number of other partnerships that are on the horizon and I think the more we partner the more people see that the benefit of doing that could be quite substantial, so I think we announced enough partnerships right now, so we'll save some for the next -- for the next announcement. But I think we're really well positioned on that front. On the M&A front because you got two questions in there in a very subtle way. But on the M&A front, look we've a very strong balance sheet. John mentioned, we've $6.4 billion of cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We're generating -- now with our guidance is over $2.9 billion of free cash flow for the year. So that\u2019s the competitive advantage for us. There is no question about it and we are very active and looking at range of opportunities around the world, both big and small. But look those opportunities needs the time to our vision in our mission. They got to accelerate our progress either against the key vertical or geographic expansion. We do tuck-in acquisitions from a tech or functional capability like a TIO type of things, but we look at this in the through the lens of do we build, do we partner or do we buy. And the amount of work that John and Bill done on there, respective platforms with risk capabilities or full infrastructure -- I mentioned the increased developer productivity, we can put out a ton of releases, now we put out some like 30,000 releases in the quarter. I mean it's amazing in velocity of new functionality and innovation that Bill and his team are putting out into the market place. And so, well, we used to have to buy at onetime because it would take us month to make a change on our website because we have such a monolithic infrastructure. Now, there is a rapid velocity, a very innovative services coming in. Second thing is we can partner now in ways that we never partnered before. Choice has enabled that. We have new velocity about cooperating with people. It's created in environment that gotten very competitive one to one that\u2019s much more cooperative. We have a ton of complimentary resources that we can use with partners. And now many times where we used to think that we will have to buy something, we can that partner on a commercial relationship to go and do that. And then obviously, if we can't do any of that we look at buy and we do that in a very disciplined manner. We have got certain amount of skill and capabilities and so you can expect us to continue to be acquisitive, but in a disciplined fashion and within the context that what I just mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Paul Condra : I guess Bill I just wondered if you could give a little more detail on Venmo. What you are seeing as you rolled that out in terms of the way consumers are using it? Are they potentially using a credit card? And then any merchant feedback and just anything, any surprises or anything unexpected just kind of help us understand where your focus is, as you are scaling that product out? Bill Ready : As we talked about in prior calls, we -- since quite a long time, really making sure that we had dialed the customers' experience, so that Venmo would not just be another payment button, but that\u2019s the uniqueness of Venmo really gets to great mobile payments as well as the social engagement. Then we have had that dialed in, we took that from person to person payments and to merchant payment. We have been working through that for a year plus. And so, we are really on the place of taking those prior learning's as what we got to put feeling really great about and we are hoping that up to the PayPal merchant base. And so the really interesting thing is happening right now is that we are saying for our Venmo users, we are lining up PayPal merchant allowing, Venmo users to pay PayPal merchants, notably without PayPal merchants having to do anymore just like we rolled out PayPal One Touch, just like we rolled out Android Pay and so you\u2019re seeing us leverage that their unique distribution capability to PayPal merchant again to go deliver Venmo consumers to those PayPal merchant. And so we\u2019re in the midst of ramp of that. But we\u2019re feeling really good about that. We not only had previously proven out the consumers on Venmo, really want to use Venmo for more things beyond P2P and we have a number of merchant where we see really, really part of results in terms of how Venmo stacks up next to other payment alternatives and those merchants we feel great of those things. For now, we really focus on how we take that from where we are now with a handful of merchant to go take that to millions of PayPal merchants. And we started that journey already, as Dan mentioned previously, we\u2019ve started to introduce that, we have merchants like lululemon and Forever 21 that are now there. We have thousands of PayPal merchants now where you can Venmo to pay and we expect, we\u2019ll progress that towards the millions of PayPal merchants over the coming quarters. We\u2019re feeling really about those things, but what consumers want to do this, what was the interaction model with what -- those are things that we really speed that prior year testing out. So now we\u2019re in the mode just thoughtfully scaling out, we\u2019re feeling really good about how that\u2019s going so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Darrin Pellar with Barclays. Darrin Pellar : Just following up on this acceleration and partnerships, Dan, especially around the mega-tech companies such as Apple and Google this past quarter. Can you touch on these partnerships a little more detail, but more -- does this underscore any type of deeper meaning around the positioning in the payments to ecosystem like any of these companies? Just given -- there has always been a lot of questions over the competitive threat from some of these names versus PayPal. Are they now more partnerships? And then John, to sneak one quick financial one in, pricing opportunity, I know there was a key driver potentially in the quarter. Is it still driver or suppose to be or could be a driver in the year? How much more of that to go? Is there or how much of an impact in the quarter and just maybe comment on a little further? Again, thanks again guys. John Rainey : Sure. Darrin, I\u2019ll start and then kick it over to Dan. As we talk a little bit about this year, pricing is an opportunity for us. We did announce a couple of corridors where we made price increases. And in part of that is reflected both in our financial results for the quarter as well as are improved guidance for the year. I will say that we\u2019re very focused on really identifying where customers drive value enhancement as part of that experience. And then pricing to that versus just arbitrarily going out and raising prices for something where there is no incremental value, that\u2019s perceived by the customers. So, we've had some targeted initiatives that we\u2019ve done and that\u2019s reflecting in our results as well as our guidance for the year. Dan Schulman : So, I\u2019ll start off and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill. But I think there is a real difference now with the partnerships that you mentioned that are major tech platform companies. I think none of that really wanted to go into payments as an end to itself. It was a means to an end that they have. And so, it might be more engagement on their platform and that engagement lead to key metrics that they want to try to keep the advertising, it could be other thing. And when we made the shift to being an open payments platform as opposed to just seeing a button as I check-out experience, and really open our platform up to pretty sophisticated technological upgrades through open APIs with the partnership we had with tokenization and that kind of thing. We were then able to become really in many ways an underlying payment OS or those tech platforms that enable them to create the experiences, that they wanted to drive for their end user. And so that partnership is fundamentally different right now and it has evolved greatly over the last several years. I'll ask Bill to add a color to that, but it's a very different conversation that we have now then we used to have. Bill Ready : Yes, I'll just add to that, that absolutely payments was a mean to end, as Dan described, and what we've demonstrated is that, through unique two sided platform that we've and our ability to connect consumers and merchants around the world do so in a single touch, makes us very unique being able to light up those experiences for those partners. And so, not only did we make the strategic shifts that they wanted to be more open platform to enable those thing, and improve our experiences so that we could do things like One Touch to drive industry-leading conversion levels to connect to those experiences. I think as mobile as matured and players have been able to see different alternatives in the ecosystem, and see what consumers have affinity issue, what drives better conversion rates. I think we're demonstrating consistently that uniqueness of our two sided platform and our ability to connect consumers and merchants, let's us drive connection between consumers and merchants of all types of consumers and tech ecosystems in ways that other can't, whatever their aspirations are whether that's selling more app or selling more devices, or driving engagement with their experiences. We're generally able to connect users to them in those experiences are in a lower friction way than anybody else out there. And that's why you're seeing us really start to play a central role there. And I think as more and more of these interesting new experiences proliferate every time that happen, I think PayPal is now positioned as a place where of course people would want to look given what we've demonstrated we can do on those things. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Just wanted to ask lots of new partnerships, the Chase deal in particular caught my eye, thinking about the ability for PayPal to process through Chase Net. Doesn't that materially lower your funding costs with Chase cards going forward? And then just as a bigger strategic picture maybe Dan with all these partnership. Are we about to launch a big in-store campaign or opportunity? Or is it going to be a more of trial in your process? Thanks so much. Dan Schulman : I'll start off with that. Obviously, we've worked closely with JP Morgan Chase over the last couple of years actually, as we've talked about the potential for how we might work together. And I'm really pleased with where we came out in this partnership. We both see a lot of value in it, if two very strong companies lending what are really impressive assets to create consumer experiences, including as you mentioned processing through Chase Net which obviously does give the potential. We are not talking about any deal terms one way or another, but potential for lower cost from that. So I'm really pleased with the comprehensive nature of the partnership that we have with Chase because time to work through all the details of it. But I think both of us are really good about and really good about what we can drive coming out of that. John Rainey : And I would just add to that, again we're not coming on the deal terms, anyone specific deal. The closer working relationship that we now have with the broader financial ecosystem, as you look through a broad lens of how you think about cost whether that\u2019s customer acquisition or risk in fraud losses, all these types of things, we as one of the largest drivers of middle transaction for banks and issuers. And then that being place that is when the larger structure growth for banks and issuers, the opportunity for us to collaborate across the number of frauds across the ecosystem is quite meaningful we believe. We see that across these partnerships, it's not just about what the cost processing a transaction, but how can we think about delivering better digital experiences to customers that has impact, positive impact on customer engagement, on customer acquisition cost, and how we think about the lifetime value of the customer risk, all these things. The opportunity collaborate with the ecosystem has many, many potential positives across the number of those things. And that\u2019s something we feel very encouraged by in the conversations that we have and relationships we build in. Dan Schulman : I think you just think about things like reward points, Discover, Chase, Citi have all decided that utilizing the reward points within the PayPal platform to utilize those for purchases that are 17 million merchants. That\u2019s a real significant differentiation for those particular financial institutions and their customers who are using their instruments, but also for PayPal because you now can utilize those reward points in a split transaction. You have X number of reward points, but maybe couldn\u2019t do that full transaction. You can now split that, you can use this reward points to purchase 40% of which we are going to do and then the other 60% can be done to whatever funding instrument you select as a consumer. That\u2019s a little over a cost funding mechanism as well for us so. There are all sorts of things within these relationships that we have, they try to enhance value for our mutual customers that, if you parse through them, it's really quite significant and differentiated from where we were certainly a year or so ago. Now the in-store stuff, we obviously now have the ability to use industry tokens from these Mastercard and others. And now, we are working with each of the FIs to use their tokens for their particular instruments. And so, you will start to see that\u2019s just a naturally begins our rollout. There really is much of a trial and error per se on this. We will have the ability for our PayPal customer, if they are opted into one of the bank services that\u2019s provided token, we will use network tokens with that. And you will simply be able to use that instrument seamlessly across where actually it is accepted now on android phone for instance across in-app experience, online experience, or an in-store experience without us having to do bespoke customization of software at the point of sale terminal. So that would just be a natural rollout utilizing existing POS technology. Okay, so thank you for that last question, Bryan. And thanks everybody for joining us. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks a lot everybody and thank you operator. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today's question-and-answer-session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle and thanks everyone for taking the time to join us today. I'm pleased to share that PayPal delivered what is perhaps our strongest quarter since our separation from eBay. Our revenues were up 22% on a currency neutral basis, coming in at 3.24 billion. Revenue growth accelerated for second consecutive quarter and was once again driven by strong PayPal core growth.  We continued to drive operating leverage across multiple areas of our business. As a result, our non-GAAP operating income grew by 32%, while our operating income margin increased approximately 160 basis points from Q3, 2016. Consequently, we delivered $0.46 of non-GAAP EPS, up 31% versus last year. Free cash flow grew by 36% to a record 841 million in the quarter and it\u2019s worth noting that we now expect our free cash flow for the year to be greater than $3 billion.  Our customer metrics, which include net new active accounts and engagement for active accounts were record setting. I pay particular attention to these measures as they represent a direct form of feedback on our value proposition, customer experiences and brand. We acquired 8.2 million net new active accounts this quarter. That is up almost 90% year-over-year and is a record number in our recent history. We ended the period with 218 million active customer accounts with over 200 million consumers now shopping at our more than 17 million merchants. We now expect we will acquire close to 30 million net new active accounts in 2017. Even with this record breaking net new active growth in our denominator, engagement per active account continues to improve, increasing to 32.8 times for the year, up from approximately 30 in the third quarter of 2016.  The combination of our growing base and continued growth in engagement drove year-over-year total payment volume growth at swap rates of 30% in the period, sequentially accelerating 335 basis points from Q2. We generated $114 billion in payment volume. Our Merchant Services volume outside of eBay grew by 34%, as we continued to grow our market share. Mobile payments led our growth again, growing approximately 54% to $40 billion in the quarter. These positive trends are the direct result of investments made across the business.  We've increased the availability of our platform and significantly improved our customer experience across an ever growing suite of products and services. Putting our customers first in everything we do and opening our platform to partners across the ecosystem has redefined our business model and our aspirations. Customer choice is one of the most visible examples of this, with approximately 20 million customers, engaging with our choice experience by actively choosing a funding option.  We continue to see consistently positive results. Customers who use Choice have much higher engagement levels and tend to spend more per transaction. They have an increased appreciation for our value proposition and as a result, increased satisfaction levels. This naturally leads to a meaningful reduction of calls to our service centers and reduced churn levels. Our streamlined sign up process is generating more net new actives. And as is evidenced by our increasing OI margin, expenses are well within our expectations.  Another measurable result from the improvements we've made in our core product experiences is the increasing value of the PayPal brand. Interbrand just named PayPal for the third year in a row as a top 100 global brand. In our first year as an independent company, we came in at number 97. Last year, we improved to number 90. This year, we were cited as one of the fastest rising brands, improving our brand rating by 10 spots to reach number 80 in the world.  Cohn & Wolfe in their influential annual index of global brands ranked by consumer perception of authenticity saw PayPal jump by 20 spots to join Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google as one of the top five most authentic brands in the world. Mobile is becoming the defining force in digital payments and it is a rapidly blurring the distinction between online and offline and accelerating the adoption of digital payments.  PayPal\u2019s One Touch experience continues to set the standard in mobile check out conversion with almost two times the conversion rate of the industry average. We now have 70 million consumers who benefit from the speed inconvenience of a Single Touch checkout and over 6 million merchants around the world now offer this transformative checkout experience. As I mentioned earlier, we processed $40 billion of mobile transactions, accounting for 35% of our TPV in the quarter.  Earlier this week, we announced that Venmo's broad and engaged base of millennial customers can now pay with Venmo at over 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. This is an important milestone for us as we both add differentiated functionality for Venmo consumers and begin to monetize Venmo. Our existing PayPal merchants are also excited to offer Venmo as a way to pay on their sites. In fact, Venmo has prompted some of the largest and most influential merchants in the US to come to PayPal for the first time.  In the quarter, we signed an agreement with the Williams-Sonoma Inc. brands to bring both Venmo and PayPal to their web and mobile properties in early 2018. That includes West Elm, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids and Williams-Sonoma. Our priority is to enrich and expand the Venmo experience, adding to the magic that has made Venmo a viral phenomenon. We are pleased that in the quarter, Venmo reported 9.4 billion of payment volume, growing 93% year-over-year.  In addition, Venmo had its strongest net new active quarter in its history, demonstrating its growing popularity and its corresponding network effect. Our partnership strategy is a key pillar in our efforts to broaden the availability of PayPal. Combining with best of our platform capabilities and services with the best assets of some of the world's most popular brands enables us to offer our mutual consumers and merchants unparalleled value. We are very pleased to be building on these partnerships. In the quarter, we announced that consumers can now use PayPal on Nintendo gaming systems in 34 countries across North America, Europe and Asia. Microsoft announced that Skype users in 22 countries can use PayPal to send and receive money via the Skype mobile app. Mastercard announced the extension of our strategic relationship into markets around the globe. And we\u2019re very pleased to announce additional financial partnerships outside of the United States.  We signed partnership agreements with Banorte in Mexico and Shinhan Card, the largest credit card issuer in South Korea that mirror our US partner agreements. Here in the US, more than 185 issuers are updating their PayPal experiences as part of our choice initiative. We continue to deepen our ever growing partnership with Facebook with new capabilities constantly being introduced. We firmly believe that great results come from doing the right things. This is fundamental to our values.  We believe that access to innovative technology must be an engine of inclusion and opportunity around the world and we are deeply committed to advancing that goal. When hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria battered the United States and the Caribbean, earthquakes throughout Mexico and fire swept through Northern California, PayPal is quick to respond. Like many other generous organizations, we made direct donations to global and local agencies. With the power and reach of our platform also allows us to do more in times of crisis.  We launched appeals to the PayPal community, agreed to cover the fees for donations, sponsored the hand-in-hand telethon and provided our fundraising platform to support many other appeals. In total, to date, we have helped to raise more than $55 million in donations to support the families and communities devastated by these natural disasters. Increasing inclusion and diversity inside our company is also a direct reflection of our values.  I'm proud to report that the PayPal Board of Directors has now reached 45% gender and ethnic diversity, up from 20% at the start of the year. And our just released diversity and inclusion report showed significant progress in our percentage of female leaders, including a 20% increase in our female Vice Presidents. We also announced 100% pay equity across gender on a global basis and a 100% pay equity across ethnicity in the US. I'm pleased with our overall progress, but we obviously have so much more to accomplish. In many ways, we are just at the beginning of our journey. The world is rapidly accelerating to digital payments and we know that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us and we have the ability to make a real difference to all the constituencies we serve.  I would like to end my remarks by thanking the global PayPal team for their passion, focus and commitment to our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. We're reporting another solid quarter with results ahead of our expectations. Our operational metrics for the quarter in addition to the financial results that we delivered demonstrate the strength of our position as the world's largest open digital payments platform. There is great momentum in our business as we approach the end of 2017.  First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for the third quarter, followed by a more detailed discussion of the drivers of our financial performance. And then I will provide a framework for how we\u2019re thinking about 2018. For the third quarter, revenue was $3.24 billion, growing 21% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP operating income grew 32% to $646 million and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% to $0.46. We generated more than $1 billion in operating cash flow and free cash flow grew 36% to $841 million. For the third quarter, our total payment volume was $114 billion, up 30% on a spot basis and 29% on a currency neutral basis, consisting of US payment volume growth of 31% and international volume growth of 27%.  Our merchant services volume grew 34% on a currency neutral basis to $98.6 billion. This represented 86.5% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented 13.5% of the total compared to 16% for the third quarter of 2016 and 20% two years ago. P2P volume, which is a component of merchant services, grew 47% to $24 billion and represented approximately 21% of total payment volume. During the third quarter, growth in active accounts was 14% and we ended the quarter with 218 million customer accounts.  Account growth was driven by the strength of our core PayPal business, followed by growth on the Venmo platform. Improvements to our on-boarding and checkout experiences and across our P2P flows enabled us to add 8.2 million new customer accounts, a record addition to our platform in a quarter. The number of payment transactions for active account on a trailing 12 month basis reached 32.8 with 7.2 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period.  In the third quarter, transactions grew 26% to 1.9 billion. Revenue grew 21% on a spot basic in Q3. US revenue grew 21% versus Q3 \u201916 and international revenues grew 22% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. In the third quarter, we saw strong revenue growth across all key geographies. At the same time, there was a partially offsetting impact from our hedging program, as we recognized $13 million in hedge losses versus a gain of $28 million last year, resulting in a headwind of more than $40 million in the period.  In the third quarter, transaction revenue grew 22% and revenues from other value added services grew 15%. Transaction revenue growth was driven by our core PayPal and BrainTree businesses and revenue from other value added services was driven by credit. For Q3, our transaction take rate was 2.48%, a decline of 16 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 and our total take rate was 2.84%, down 21 basis points year-over-year. In recent quarters, our take rate declines have compressed and the pressure on our take rate has been predominantly driven by growth in P2P. While this was the largest single contributor to the take rate decline in the third quarter, we also saw increased pressure from our hedge loss, from lower growth in credit revenue and from the inclusion of TIO Networks in our results. Volume based expenses grew 33% in Q3.  Transaction expense was $1.1 billion and represented 97 basis points of TPV, consistent with our expectations that we would see less pressure in Q3 relative to the first and second quarters of 2017. Transaction loss in the quarter was $219 million or 19 basis points of TPV, an increase of 1 basis point versus the same period a year ago. Loan losses across our consumer and merchant credit products were $144 million, representing 26% growth in line with the growth of our receivables portfolio.  Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge-off rate was 6.4% in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivables balance, including both principal and interest of $6.7 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolios and a total reserve of $424 million. We continue to see excellent results in managing the cost of our business. In the third quarter, other operating expenses increased only 4.8% to $1.1 billion, growing at less than a quarter of the rate of growth of revenue. The slower rate of growth in non-volume based expenses drove 550 basis points of operating leverage versus Q3 \u201916 and represent 35% of total revenue. Normalizing for the acquisitions of TIO Networks, and Swift Financial, other operating expenses increased only 3.5%. Considering we grew revenue by more than 20%, this is exceptional performance.  We're managing costs very efficiently, allowing us to deliver better cost performance, relative to our expectations, while at the same time, investing in our growth initiatives. Consistent with the first half of the year, other operating expenses increased $0.09 for every incremental dollar of revenue, demonstrating the scalability of our platform. Year-to-date, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to scale with minimal incremental cost. Strong revenue growth and cost discipline resulted in record non-GAAP operating income and EPS growth.  Non-GAAP operating income grew 32% to $646 million and operating margin expanded approximately 160 basis points to 20% compared to Q3 \u201916. GAAP operating income grew 22% in the third quarter to $423 million with an operating margin of 13%, flat to last year. Non-GAAP EPS grew 31% in the third quarter to $0.46 and GAAP EPS grew 17% to $0.31. The hurricanes in the southeast also affected our performance in the quarter. Waiving late fees and increasing reserves for our credit customers had an approximate $0.01 per share impact on our results.  We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7 billion. Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 36% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $841 million, representing $0.26 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $165 million or approximately 5% of revenue. We also funded two acquisitions during the third quarter, as the TIO Networks and Swift Financial transactions closed in July and September respectively.  Capital return continues to be a core component of our overall capital allocation strategy. And year-to-date, we\u2019ve returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $300 million remaining on our original $2 billion authorization, after which time, we will begin buying back stock under the $5 billion authorization that was approved earlier this year. Our business generates significant cash flow and we will continue to take a long term view of capital allocation to maximize value creation, while optimizing our capital structure and investing for growth.  I would now like to discuss our updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year as well as our initial thoughts on 2018. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.63 billion or 20% to 22% growth on a currency neutral basis. We also expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. I\u2019d also like to give you some detail on how we're thinking about other operating expense growth in the fourth quarter.  Our current plans contemplate discretionary investments and product development and sales and marketing in the fourth quarter that are over and above our current trend and will result in elevated growth in other OpEx, relative to the first three quarters of 2017. Importantly, these investments will benefit our results in 2018. For the full year, we expect other operating expenses to grow in the mid single digits.  We now expect revenue for 2017 to be in the range of $12.92 billion to $12.98 billion or 20% to 21% growth on a currency neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.86 to $1.88. In addition, given the strong free cash flow that we have generated all year, we now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $3 billion. We're also reaffirming our prior full year 2017 guidance on CapEx of approximately 5% of revenue and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17.5% to 18.5%.  We are still in our planning process for 2018, but I'd like to provide you with an initial framework for how we\u2019re thinking about our business next year. We are planning for payment volume on a spot basis to grow at a rate -- in the range of mid to high 20%. Also, on a spot basis, we expect approximately 20% growth in both revenue and non-GAAP operating income with our GAAP operating margin expanding in line with non-GAAP operating margin.  This view incorporates our initial integration and investment assumptions for the acquisitions of TIO Networks and Swift Financial, offset by modest operating margin expansion in the rest of our business. As we have not yet announced our plans for consumer credit as they relate to pursuing a more asset light approach, our initial framework for 2018 does not incorporate the financial impact of this initiative.  Our process is on track and we're in ongoing negotiations and at the current pace, we expect to announce the deal towards the end of the year. We're committed to structuring the best partnership for PayPal that will create the most shareholder value over the long term. We\u2019ll provide additional detail on our outlook for 2018 when we announce our plans for consumer credit.  As we reflect on the first three quarters of 2017, we're very encouraged by our performance and the opportunities ahead. This year, we have accelerated our revenue growth and earnings growth and generated record free cash flow. We're building superior experiences for our consumers and merchants.  The sustained momentum we see in the business gives us the confidence to invest in high potential areas such as Venmo and PayPal working capital. We\u2019re extremely pleased with our progress and I also want to thank all PayPal\u2019s customers and our colleagues worldwide for making this another outstanding quarter. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : So just wanted to ask a question, if we go back to the Analyst Day in 2016, you guys had indicated at that point that the credit business was about almost 10% of revenue and a little bit more than that as a percentage of operating profit. So I wanted to see if those numbers are still valid today. And then just related, can you give us an idea of what percent of your operating profit currently comes from eBay. Bill Ready : Sure, Jason. I'll take that. So the way you think about credit is, it has more or less grown in line with the rest of our business since we gave that guidance at that point in time. Credit represented - depending upon the quarter about 2% or 2.5% of TPV. And that was the case when we gave that guidance on revenue and profit at that Analyst Day. So it's fair to conclude that it represents a similar portion today. To be clear on asset-light, what we'd like to do is continue to very much be in the credit business for our merchants and our consumers and provide all of the benefit that they derive from that. But we can do that in a much more asset-light way where we can free up that capital to utilize for other maybe seemingly higher turning alternatives. At the same point in time we would continue to share in the economics of that business if we were to elect to pursue a partnership type of arrangement there. And then the second part of your question was eBay. eBay - we hadn\u2019t disclosed what percentage of our business that represents in terms of profit. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've - that's about 13.5% of our volume today that\u2019s come down from 20% just a couple of years ago. And whether it's TPV or revenue what you've seen is that that declined 300 to 400 basis points each year in terms of the percentage of our overall volume in the business and revenue in the business in this case maybe. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Fawcett : I just had a question on account adds those have been very strong 30 million or 25 expectation. What's driving that strength and how much benefit are you getting from recent partnerships and I guess a little color on how many accounts has Venmo have and how is that growth versus the core PayPal? Thanks. Dan Schulman : This is Dan, I\u2019ll take that question and Bill you can jump in on this. So this is not any one thing that\u2019s driving our growth, it\u2019s multiple initiates that we\u2019ve launched. In general as we get bigger we\u2019re seeing a network effect start to take haul, we have over 17 million merchants on a network now, now over 200 million consumers and there is distinctly a network effect. We've also seen all the core experiences that Bill and his team and others in the company that worked on whether that be availability, latency, One Touch, choice, our new mobile app out there that are all kind of bending multi-year curves now with all of our product curves bending upwards reversing a many year trend line that we had before. That\u2019s reducing churn and also attracting a lot of new customers. We\u2019ve got a bunch of new products out there right now from bill pay to international remittances to new services on P2P, new flows on P2P and so those are driving a ton of net new adds as well. Really interesting thing right now is obviously choice has streamlined the sign-up process and we\u2019re seeing good benefit from that. But I would say on the partnership front, we are at the very beginning of that. There is much more ahead of us than behind us. We've had some marketing campaign launched within financial institutions to drive card linking to PayPal, but the vast majority of that is still ahead us. In terms of the ratios of Venmo to the core, we never really announced those specifically. What I would say again as I said in my remarks is Venmo had a record net new active quarter. But the core had an even stronger, a record net new actives. So you see more than a majority coming from core PayPal as opposed to Venmo on this. Anything else, Bill, you'd add. Hope that answers your question, James. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now. Heath Terry : Wondering if you can kind of give us a bit of a sense as you sign more and more merchants up to the platform. Kind of where you are both from a partnership and a technology standpoint on in-store transactions. And then one just sort of quick follow-up on the comments that were made around transactional margins, you called out several things that are sort of driving the modest pressure that we're seeing there. Unless I missed it, funding mix wasn't one of them. Given what you're seeing in choice, I'm assuming that was intentional, but just wanted to confirm. Dan Schulman : So you have a couple of questions there, Heath, as usual we respect. So let met talk a little bit about some of our purchase, turn it over to Bill and then John will address the last part of your question. So, we are increasingly turning from being a product company into a platform company and what we mean by that is we\u2019re moving well beyond just check out as a button to really offering a full suite of capabilities and services that enable merchants to move into digital commerce to take advantage of mobile which is something every single one of our retailers from small merchants to the very largest are thinking about right now. Because the face of commerce is rapidly changing driven by mobile, and mobile as I mentioned is blurring that distinction between online and offline. Because it\u2019s blurring that distinction our platform capabilities are increasingly omni in nature. Now one of the things that still ahead of us and one of the things that accrued to us as part of our network agreement that we had with Mastercard and Visa and Discover as well as all of our relationships with financial institutions is access to tokens. We're not going to do bespoke customization coming into the offline world, but we can use industry standard tokenization and add that capability into our app which we expect to do next year to start to move into the offline marketplace. Again, we think that a lot of what\u2019s going to happen at offline will be value proposition driven not form factor driven. But our PayPal digital wallet will have the ability for somebody to use their mobile phone eventually at a point of sale expect NFC solutions. Bill, anything you\u2019d add on top of that. Bill Ready : I would just say on in-store one of the fantastic things that\u2019s happening on top of what Dan was describing where we have great partnerships both with networks as well as Google and Android Pay and Vodafone and others that allow us to do in-store point of sale. We\u2019re also seeing just amazing momentum on e-commerce style experiences coming into the store, which really plays to our strengths. So things like buy online pick up in-store, you can witness in most major retailers around the country are starting to carve off sections of the stores that are specifically devoted to buy online pick up in-store as you see more and more of that happening. That\u2019s really home field advantage for us that we are becoming the primary way that consumers think about accessing great new digital experiences like that. So we certainly see growth across the board in mobile, but this is a really interesting area for us where we see mobile starting to really come into the stores to buy online pick up in-store and those types of things in addition to the way that folks thought about it traditionally of using the mobile device at point of sale where you\u2019ve got great partnerships as Dan describes that help get us into those. John Rainey : And Heath, this is John, just on the last part of your question with respect to transaction expense. You\u2019re right, while it\u2019s a small year-over-year increase. This was down on a unit basis in terms of TPV from what we saw in the first half of year. And we indicated that would be the case. At 97 bps this quarter, it\u2019s down from the high watermark of 100 bps in the second quarter. It\u2019s a result of couple of things. But one we talked about before as our customers are opting into choice. There is much more balance across the various funding instruments that they choose than what our initial expectations were. At the same point in time with great growth on platforms like Venmo, which come at a very low expense rate that actually helps suppress the rate of growth in that unit level. A good way to think about this even going to the fourth quarter and into 2018 is this is more or less for that period of time the level that we expect. I did note again 100 basis points was the - at least the high watermark for the foreseeable future for us in this areas. So we expect to contain the inflation in this area going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Dan, during the quarter there were some press articles implying you guys were on the lookout for acquisitions. I know you made a bunch already, but I assume you might have been talking about something larger or more transformative. Could you just talk about where you guys might feel like you lack and some areas that you're looking at in size. Thanks. Dan Schulman : So yeah I did read some of those articles that were out there. Look I start off by saying that I really need pleased and I'm happy with the set of assets and capabilities we have today. We've got a leading market position in those. I feel really good about where we stand. We have a very robust product pipeline and roadmap. And we're ready with the assets we have to compete as a leader in the market today. I think we're playing from a position of strength as we go into the market and look at what\u2019s available. Obviously we have a very strong balance sheet and it's a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward. We\u2019ve got some $7 billion on our balance sheet. As John mentioned over $3 billion of free cash flow that we\u2019ll have this year. And our intention is to stay acquisitive and be a consolidator in the industry. We look at hundreds of opportunities every single quarter from small investments we make in some interesting start ups to much larger. And we look at the whole gamut of that. Now the criteria we look at this it got to fit into the vision and mission that we've set out for ourselves, it needs to accelerate our progress, I\u2019m going to talk about that in a second, across key vertical like a Bill Pay would be an example of that, a geography or some technology that could be a security bolt-o something like that helps our platform overall. And we look at all of that through the lens of build, partner and buy. And on the build side as I\u2019ve not mentioned before and Bill has talked about, we are so much more productive and innovative internally than we've ever been before. We had something like 300% increase in releases that we're doing now in what used to be a necessity for us to buy several years ago to innovate. Is now quite well covered by what we built internally. The other thing obviously is we've created a fundamentally different technological architecture an open-platform that allow us to partner in ways that we've never been able to go do before and so there used to be capabilities we need that now we can merge the assets of a partner into our platform and vice a versa without needing to acquire. And then obviously there's buying. And as I mentioned we look at that across the world and at all levels of different investment that we might make on that. But we're very disciplined in a way we look at that. Honestly we don't mind if it\u2019s small or a large acquisition but it\u2019s got to make sense to us on the criteria that aligned above and it\u2019s got to make sense to us from a cost basis. And so you can expect us to be acquisitive, but in a disciplined and thoughtful manner. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Just wanted to ask on the 2018 guidance. Does that include any Venmo monetization and if not, how are you thinking about that the size and timing of the Venmo monetization opportunity. And then just a quick on \u201918, the \u201918 numbers, does it include and how much FX and acquisitions? Thanks. John Rainey : Bryan, it\u2019s John. Good to speak with you. We do have some modest assumptions about monetizing Venmo going into next year. We\u2019re courage by the launch of Pay with Venmo with 2 million merchants right now. We\u2019ll continue to expand that. But as we said before this is has been an area of investment for us. We're looking forward to being able to monetize this. But we've got pretty measures expectations around this. So we don't want to get too far out in front of ourselves. This is a pretty precious experience. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we get it right. And so given in the guidance that we gave approximately 20% revenue growth and 20% earnings growth that does include some assumptions about Venmo. But this is a leg of growth for us, profitable growth into the future. And we've got a multi-year outlook on what this will be. In terms of the guidance that we gave with respect to FX that basically assume the currency environment that we're in right now. That answers your question. Bryan Keane : And then acquisitions, is there any acquisitions in that? John Rainey : No, that\u2019s an organic assumption say for the two acquisitions that we already acquired in the third quarter this year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open. Bob Napoli : The actives, want to dig in that a little bit more. Dan, when you - John, Bill, when you guys spun off you were targeting 3 to 5 million net new ads per quarter and obviously you haven't updated that guidance and that guidance is old. The 8 million the new substantial ramp up, how much of that is from customer choice. I think John you had said at one point there were a million customers a month that were signing up and not activating because - you thought because they didn't - you didn't have customer choice. How much of that is coming from customer choice and what is - going into next year, where there some low hanging fruit this year that we should see a big [indiscernible] in active account growth going into next year. Dan Schulman : I\u2019ll start off and then it over to either John or Bill as we go into this. So obviously we hit a different level in terms of acquisition and that 3 to 5 million is outdated. We did talk about this year that we expect to acquire close to 30 million net new actives. A part of that is driven by choice and a part of it is driven by new experiences, our P2P flows, reduction in churn that\u2019s going on. So there is really not one thing that I would point to, you are right, we were losing out on a million or so activations a month that had put in a funding instrument but did not do a transaction with us because we also asked for additional information post that and that's not occurring right now. So I think we are at a different level in terms of the net new actives going forward. We\u2019ll update that as we look at updating our overall 2018 guidance for you. So stay tuned on that but obviously 3 to 5 million is an old number now. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now. Tien- tsin Huang : Just one last, Bill, just on Braintree performance and maybe give us an update on when share there anything new on PayPal share, a checkout or on the merchant ads side is that still primarily be driven by Braintree or core PayPal, has that mix changed? Thanks. Dan Schulman : We continue to see great performance across our merchant segments. Braintree continues to perform really well in line with what we discussed previously. And share of checkout driven by One Touch and industry leading conversion rate in addition to us having strong consumer growth, our share of checkout continues to increase. When you look at our merchant services volume growth that is significantly beyond the growth of the e-commerce industry which means that we continue to take share. And that taking of share is both in new merchant sign-ups that are really across small businesses, mid-market as well as a large enterprise, so across every segment we continue to add merchant. And then within each of those merchants we continue to see expansion of our share of checkout as consumers more and more gravitate towards PayPal given that we have conversion rate that is nearly twice that of entering a card and online. So it's broad-based across those but we see each of those segments performing well inclusive of the Braintree segment. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now. Darrin Peller : Just if we could follow up quickly on the outlook for \u201818. Maybe John if you could touch on pricing and how that's going highs. Some of the updates you're doing now and then what\u2019s included in that and your outlook. And then really just on top of that your guidance on margins, I just want to make sure we're clear on it. Now you\u2019re talking about it being in line with GAAP operating income growth which it sounded like was also 20% I think among revenue growth. I mean is that - what is the margin expectation, your expansion or anything impacting next year versus this year. Thanks. Dan Schulman : First on pricing, as you are aware we've made a few different price changes this year positive and negative, try to optimize for certain corridors where we operate. But the main thing to take away from pricing is that we want to price in areas to where we can clearly attribute that price to value that\u2019s being added to the customers experience. And so to your question about whether that assumes anything in 2018, yes it does. This is a pricing in any business is an ongoing driver of value that you need to be responsive to the broader market and competitive set in which you operate. So we've seen some benefit from that in 2017 and we would expect that to continue not only in 2018, but into further years. On the second part of your question, with respect to margin expectations in 2018. We do still expect to have sort of the same guidance that we said before as stable to growing operating margins and that\u2019s whether you're talking about 2018 or the next few years after that. As I noted in my prepared remarks we are integrating to acquisitions next year. And so there's always integration and investment around that. If you were to normalize for that, you would certainly see that organically there is margin expansion in the business. And importantly as I noted in my remarks and has been quite a focus this year that the GAAP operating margin is also expanding in line with non-GAAP operating margin next year. Again some of the changes that we made with respect to share-based compensation this year we said were specific to this year, we do not expect that to continue at that level in the future. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Okay. Our last question please operator. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open. George Mihalos : If I could just ask a question around Pay with Venmo from a margin perspective. If we think about the funding sources there and I know you guys are encouraging people linking credit cards to the Venmo wallet. But a substantial portion of that is still going to be funded through sort of cash on hand. Is there any reason why we shouldn't think that Pay with Venmo won't be accretive to your overall transaction margin and not sure if you're willing to provide any color as to how much of an uplift that might provide for \u201918. Thank you. Bill Ready : I\u2019ll describe Pay with Venmo with a little more detail. One of the beautiful things about what we have done with the Pay with Venmo deployment is that we're making that automatically available to PayPal merchants over the same distribution rail that we used to have such a rapid deployment of PayPal One Touch. And so while that makes it really easy for the merchant to adopt and really easy for the consumer to have more places to use it, it means that those merchants are accepting Venmo on the exact same terms that they would accept PayPal. So our revenue on those transactions when somebody uses Venmo to pay at one of those PayPal merchants, our revenue on that transaction would be exactly the same as if that user had paid with PayPal. As you rightly noted Venmo tends toward predominantly lower cost funding instruments so the cost of those transactions it would be reasonable to assume is going to less than the average across the PayPal base. And so I think your assumptions there are directionally correct. We are not providing guidance on how much of that or any of those types of things. But at a unit level you're exactly right that is the same revenue per transaction for us but with a wallet that is loaded with on average lower cost funding instruments for us. Dan Schulman : Thank you, George, for that question, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, enjoy the rest of your afternoon.",

We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018 and the expected impact of tax reform. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, January 31, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. 2017 was a transformative year for PayPal with consistently strong and in many cases record breaking results. I'd like to highlight couple of areas in particular. First, we achieved record net new actives and engagement on our core platform, by increasing our reach and relevant with both consumers and merchants. Importantly, we anticipate this elevated level of net new actives to continue in 2018. As we experience increasing network effects from our scale. Second, we continue to grow our market share through our increasing leadership in mobile and by introducing a suite of new and innovative services and project experiences for our customers. Third, we meaningfully strengthen our competitive positioning due to rollout customer choice. The combination of customer choice and our move towards an open platform architecture enabled strategic partnership with many of the world leading companies. Several of these companies had previously been perceived as potential adversaries. The partnerships have opened new avenues of growth from geographic expansion to in-store payments. Fourth, we announce a new long-term strategic partnership with Synchrony Financial, which will result in PayPal receiving more than $6 billion in cash proceeds at closing. The deal also freeze up more than $1 billion in free cash flow each year, which we will allocate the higher yielding organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Finally, we did all this while delivering consistently strong financial results. I'll discuss the first four areas in more detail in a moment, but I want to start with our financial results for Q4. I am pleased to say that Q4 was our strongest quarter of the year, capping off landmarks 2017. Payment volume grew 29% on a currency neutral basis to a $131.4 billion, generating revenue of 3.71 billion. Revenue grew by 24% and this is our third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. The strong revenue performance combined with disciplined OpEx management drove non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which was up 30% year-over-year. Our customer metrics were particularly strong. We drove a record 8.7 of new active account [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by your conference will begin momentarily. Thank you. Speakers your line is now open. Dan Schulman : Okay, I\u2019m back. I was in the middle of these exciting results and shocked even our speaker. So, okay, so let me start off just recapping our fourth quarter. As I mentioned, our payment volume was up 29% on a currency neutral basis to $131.4 billion, generating revenue of $3.71 billion. Revenue grew by 24% and this is our third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. This strong revenue performance combined with disciplined OpEx management drove our non-GAAP EPS to $0.55 up 30% year-over-year. Our customer metrics were particular strong. We drove a record 8.7 million net new active accounts and that was up 61% over Q4 of 2016. And we ended the year with 227 million active accounts, adding more than 29 million net new actives for the year. And it\u2019s worth noting that we now serve 18 million merchants on our platform. Importantly, engagement was once again higher at 33.6 transactions for active account. I think it's started to note that our accelerating net new active growth hides the true underlying growth of engagement. If our total net new ads have grown at the same rate last year, our growth in engagement would have increased a 11% to approximately 34.5%. It\u2019s particularly encouraging that our net new active cohorts acquired in 2017 are showing an acceleration and engagement versus similar cohorts from 2016. The net take away as we are bringing on record, net new actives with higher engagement than ever before and that obviously bodes well as we look ahead. Our partnership with Synchrony Financial accomplishes every goal we set out for our asset life strategy. The transaction substantially reduces our overall risk profile. It provides us the opportunity to double down on our innovative credit experiences for our merchants and our consumers, while sharing in the profit growth. And as I said earlier, it frees up approximately 1 billion in annualized cash flows and more than 6 billion in cash. If we combined this cash windfall with the ability to repatriate these funds due to the recently passed tax reform bill, we dramatically increase the flexibility of our cash position, enabling us to more efficiently outgain our capital, the higher yielding opportunities. John will be sharing more detail later in the call about the strategic benefits of our Synchrony Partnership and will discuss the impacts of the Synchrony transaction on our Q4 results and our expectations for 2018. This past year, we saw strength in our leadership position in digital payments and we substantially expanded our opportunities for future growth. We introduced a host of new product experiences and they are driving further differentiation from our competitors. Customer choice essential to this effort and continues to be an important element in the evolution of Phase out. In the fourth quarter, we completed to rollout of choice in the United States, the UK, Australia, Canada and Japan with 30 million consumers now opted in. In the United States where choice has been live to say more than 12 months, we continue to see a meaningful lift and engagement in payment volume and a significant reduction in churn. And consistent with previous quarters, our transaction expenses remain well within our expectations as evidenced by our increasing OI margin. Across the globe, contact rates into our customer service centers continue to decline. In fact, in the fourth quarter of this year, we experienced lower overall call lines into our customer service centers than we did in Q4 of 2014, despite our base increasing by 65 million active accounts and literally billion of additional transaction. I attribute our reduction in call volume to not only choice, but to the tremendous strides Bill and as Steve have made in enhancing our core experiences from improved availability to decrease latency to increase feature functionality and reduce friction across our platform. This quarter was particularly significant in the number of new and notable large merchants who joined the PayPal platform. Merchants are increasingly choosing PayPal for our ability to deliver the tools that need to compete and thrive in an increasingly competitive global and mobile environment. If you combine that with the value of the 209 million engage consumers we bring to their omni-channels, you can see why we have such a strong and compelling value acquisition for merchants. This quarter, we signed a global agreement with the Walt Disney Company. We welcome Dillards, which ranks among the nation's largest fashion retailers. QVC has agreed to make PayPal available to their customers. The QVC Group is the number three in e-commerce in North America and number three in mobile commerce in the U.S. according to Internet Retailer. In Europe, ePRICE which is the largest Italian market place began accepting PayPal payments and Dell began offering PayPal credit in the UK. In India, PayPal is available as a way to pay on BookMyShow and MakeMyTrip, the largest online entertainment ticketing platform and the largest online travel company in the country. This holiday season clearly demonstrated the powerful trends that are reshaping retail and driving new consumer behaviors driven by the increasing penetration of smartphones. These trends drove strong mobile engagement on our platform over the busy holiday shopping season. PayPal processed 48 billion in mobile payment volume in the fourth quarter and that was at 63% growth year-over-year and 36% of our quarterly TPV. For the full year, mobile represented 34% of overall payment volume on our platform with total mobile payment volume growing 52% to 155 billion for the year. Our leadership in mobile continuously driven by the exceptional experiences we're able to deliver. We continue to drive fast, frictionless and engaging consumer expenses with our One Touch product. We ended the fourth quarter with over 80 million consumers opted into One Touch, up from 40 million a year ago. And the number of merchants offering One Touch now totaled more than 80 million compared with 5 million a year ago. Venmo continues to define digital payments for a generation of passionate users here in the U.S. For the first time in the quarter, they're more surpassed 10 billion in payment volume with 10. 4 billion processed in Q4, an increase of 86% year-over-year. For the full year, Venmo's volume increased 97% with almost 35 billion in payment volume process. We also experienced another very strong quarter of net new asset to Venmo and added the largest cohort of annual net new actives to Venmo in its history. We continue our rollout to pay with Venmo providing our Venmo users with more ways to pay with the service they love and giving our merchants access to this covenant demographic. While we're still in the early stages of monetization, we're very encouraged by our initial leads on engagement. In fact, the adoption of services that we're able to monetize on Venmo is tracking above the P2P adoption Venmo experienced at a similar point in its history. Given our experience this past year, we believe our future opportunities are extensive and compelling. We\u2019re writing powerful and accelerating tailwinds created by two global trends, the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile devices. We're actively positioning ourselves to take full advantage of these trends and strategically moving our business into areas where we believe these transformations are creating the strongest opportunities. Throughout 2017, we redefined our competitive position in our echo system and during strategic partnerships with many of the companies leading the digital mobile transformation around the world. We are down the process of the implemented productive and expensive partnerships with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Bank of America and China UnionPay. We are working closely with over 20 of the largest credit card issuers in the world. The majority of which are kicked off campaigns to encourage and in many cases incent customers to engage with PayPal. For example, we are working with both Citi and FIS to create experiences that are driving enhanced consumer engagement and activation. With Citi customers can provision their Citi cards to new or existing PayPal accounts directly from Citi's online property. With FIS, the ability to link accounts directly to PayPal is now available to all of FIS banking customers. We signed an agreement with Bank of America to enable PayPal as a way to disburse payments on behalf of their corporate clients. And this year, we will integrate credit card reward points from major issuers into our PayPal Wallet, as a funding source for consumers to use when they purchase at PayPal merchants. And we will also begin to rollout the use of industry standard tokens to pay in-store wherever NFC is accepted. In the quarter, we expanded our partnership with Facebook Messenger, adding a contextual commerce experience that allows sellers send invoices to buyers as well as to adding PayPal as a way to fund P2P transactions within Messenger conversations. In China where mobile payments are a thriving part of everyday life, our relationships with strategic partners have the potential to substantially increase our opportunity. PayPal is now used by 10s of 1000s of Chinese merchants on the AliExpress website in order to transact seamlessly with PayPal consumers outside of China. We are also purely looking forward to the upcoming launch of our Baidu partnership. In November, we announced a launch of our domestic operations in India opening another substantial market for PayPal, while we have been supporting Indian merchants for years by helping themselves to international buyers. We are now able to work with key merchants to sell domestically as well. We planned our aggressively expand this programs to more merchants in India throughout 2018. Indian is the market in which the government is actively working towards demonetization and building a modern digital economy, and we view India as a strong and compelling opportunity for PayPal. With well more than a billion digital consumers and a thriving online merchant community deepening our engagement in China and India will continue to be a priority for PayPal in 2018. We believe these markets offers significant opportunities to drive substantial scale. I would also like to comment on our relationships with eBay. We have a very close partnership and a long history with eBay. This is governed by an operating agreement that runs for another 2.5 years through July 2020. The operating agreement lays out a thoughtful transition and allows for smooth migration from jointly owned entities to independent companies through the five years following separation. The agreement allows for eBay to eventually become merchant of record and play a more direct role in managing the payment experience on their platform and we\u2019re actively partnering with eBay to help their implementation of merchant of record capabilities. The operating agreement also allows for eBay to work with alternate payment service providers overtime as a transition to merchant of record. As part of that, I am very pleased to announce, the PayPal and eBay have signed a term sheet to provide our brand to services at least through July 2023. Both our 2018 and our medium-term guidance already includes the anticipated economic impact of the eBay transition, which is quite manageable over a multi-year period. As such we see no need to change our medium-term guidance. Given our long history with eBay buyers and sellers, both Devin Wenig and I believe a manageable transition and sustained relationship is in the best interest of our mutual customers. I am very pleased we have agreed to extend our partnership and look forward to building on strong relationship we've established since separation. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, 2017 was a landmark year for PayPal on multiple fronts. We entered 2018 with strong and accelerating trends, supporting our increasingly differentiated and expands the value propositions and scale. We\u2019ve expanded our branded PayPal relationship with eBay through July 2023, which was one of our primary goals in 2017. These accomplishments set us up for sustainable and predictable growth over the foreseeable future. Before we understand the need to work even harder to leave up to and deliver on the value, our customers and shareholders expect from us. We have a substantial opportunity to shape the future of digital payments over the next decade and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2018. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank our PayPal customers, partners and employees for making 2017 a great year. We achieved many significant milestones in 2017 and are well-positioned to continue delivering on our commitments and executing against our strategic plans. Before I go into details of the fourth quarter, I would like to provide a few highlights for the full-year. For 2017, active accounts grew 15% to $227 million and acceleration of 500 basis points over the 2016 growth rate. Payment volume grew 27% on a currency neutral basis to $451 billion. Approximately 34% of this volume was mobile where we saw 52% volume growth for the year. Revenue for 2017 exceeded $13 billion growing 21% on currency neutral basis. For the full year, revenue related to eBay market places grew 7%, while our merchants' service revenue grew 24% more than three times the rate with our legacy eBay market places business. For the year, non-GAAP earnings per share grew 27% to $1.90 and we return more than $1 billion to shareholders. I'd first like to discuss the impact of tax reform. We believe the modernization of U.S. tax code is a significant step forward in a clear path of PayPal and its shareholders. The ability to work efficiently and strategically allocate capital is an unmitigated benefit. The full value of which we expect to utilize over the medium and long term, I would note if we\u2019re still the number of open items that require clarification and we may define our estimated impact in future quarters, its further information and interpretation become available. Our fourth quarter GAAP results include a one-time charge for the 180 million related to the deemed repatriation of unrelated earnings on foreign subsidiaries and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 20% over the next three years. We will tight this range as we'll give more clarity. I would now like to review the items included in non-GAAP results from the reclassification of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to held for sale relating to our November agreement with Synchrony Financial. These changes reduce comparability to prior periods. We're relevant to the discussion. I will provide normalized results to adjust from these changes. Following the closing of the transaction which we expect to occur in the third quarter, the U.S. consumer credit portfolio will no longer sit on our balance sheet, and we will no longer encore any cost related to the charge off of principal for interest. First, other value added services revenue benefited by approximately $26 million in the quarter as a result of no longer recognized reserves on interest receivables for the U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Second, transaction and loan losses benefited by approximately $74 million for no longer recognizing reserves on principal receivables for the U.S. consumer credit portfolio; and third, non-transactional related expenses were negatively impacted by $92 million from the recognition of incurred charge offs of principal and interest. There is also a GAAP earning impact from the transaction consistent with our prior quarters related to the agreement and those are noticed in the investor update closer to that. Moving to our results, for the fourth quarter our total payments volumes was $1.31 billion up 30% on a spot basis and 29% on a currency neutral basis. Merchant services volume grew 33% on a currency neutral basis to $114 billion represented 87% of our volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented 13% of the total compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 19% two years ago. P2P volume, which is a component of merchant services, and includes volumes across core, Venmo and Zoom grew 50% to $27 billion and represented approximately 20% of total payment volume. During the first quarter, growth in active accounts was 15%. We ended the quarter with 227 million customer accounts. We added 8.7 million active accounts in the quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we have experienced an acceleration in the growth of active accounts, and in each of the last five quarters, we've added a record number of net new customer accounts. Account growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our core PayPal business followed by strong growth in Venmo accounts. Revenue grew 24% on a spot basis in Q4 with 23% growth in transaction revenue and 32% growth in other value added services. Transaction revenue growth was primarily driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, normalizing for the effect of held for sale accounting revenue growth from other value added services was driven by strong credit growth from the consumer side as well as the acquisition of Swift Financial, both total and transaction take rates are affected by our hedging program, as we recognized hedge gains and losses in international transaction revenue. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a hedging loss of $29 million compared to a $50 million gain in Q4 of 2016 resulting in a $79 million headwind in the period. For the fourth quarter, our transaction take rate was 2.45%, a decline of 18 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, and our total take rate was 2.82%, also down 18 basis points year-over-year. Growth in our P2P businesses led by Venmo and impact from the hedging loss resulted in approximately two thirds of the take rate decline, with the remaining 5 basis points decline resulting from the business mix effect of lower eBay growth in conjunction with strong Braintree growth. Volume based expenses grew 26% in Q4. Normalizing for the effect of held for sale accounting, these expenses would have grown in line with volume growth. Transaction expense was $1.3 billion and represented 96 basis points of TPV, consistent with the expense rate in Q4 2016, and our expectations that we would see less pressure in the back half of 2017 relative to the first half of the year. Increased core PayPal funding expenses were offset by lower funding costs from growth in P2P. Transaction loss in the quarter was $248 million or 19 basis points of TPV flat for the same period last year as well as Q3 2017. Loan losses were $75 million, down nearly 40% from the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the effect of held for sale accounting on the income statement. We estimate that this change in accounting designation benefitted loan losses by approximately $74 million. Due to the change to held for sale accounting we no longer maintain the result for losses and are reflecting incurred losses in the line item called restructuring and other charges on our income statement as part of our non-transaction related expenses. Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. Transaction margin in dollars was 2.1 billion growing 23%. Adjusted for the impact of held for sale accounting transaction margin was $2 billion, representing 17% growth versus last year. This represents the highest rate of growth since separation. For the quarter, transaction margin as a rate was 57.1%. On an adjusted basis, transaction margin was 54.8%. Non-transaction related expenses or other operating expenses grew 19% in the quarter. Normalizing for the held for sale accounting adjustments, these non-transaction related expenses would have grown approximately 10.5% resulted in 385 basis points to operating leverage. Further adjusting for the acquisitions of Swift Financial and TIO Networks, we would have seen non-transactional rate of expenses grow at approximately 6% for the quarter. Relative to Q4 \u201916, fourth quarter this year sales and marketing expenses grew 25%, product development costs increased 10% and customer support in operations costs grew 7%. Consistent with the cadence of discretionary spending that we have previously discussed. In the quarter, they were incremental costs related to our acquisitions of Swift Financial and TIO, which expected to grow of our sales and marketing and customer support costs. In addition, we launch marketing campaigns for our P2P businesses and support at the global launch of our choice initiatives. And in product development, we invested in our India domestic payments business, pay with Venmo and an improving our core merchant in consumer experiences. After adjusting for held for sale accounting treatment non-transactional related expenses increased $0.17 in Q4 for every incremental dollar revenue. After back out incremental revenue and costs associated with our acquisitions of Swift Financial and TIO, these expenses increased only $0.11 for every incremental dollar of revenue. And for the full year, these expenses increased only $0.10 for every dollar increasing revenue indicative of the underlying leverage and scalability enhance in our operating model. In the fourth quarter, operating income grew 30% to 807 million on 24% top-line growth resulting in the 100 basis points of operating leverage. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 30% in the fourth quarter to $0.55. Q4 capital expenses were $180 million or approximately 5% of revenue. As a result of changes from the designation of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, net new loans of $1.3 billion reduced cash flow from operations in the quarter. Prior to this change in designation, this amount would have been recognized in cash flows from investing activities. As a result, cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was negative $147 million with free cash flow in the quarter of negative $327 million. On a normalized basis, we would have recognized approximately $972 million in free cash flow generating approximately $0.26 free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7.7 billion. In 2017, we return $1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases buying back our stock and the average price of $51. Our business generates significant free cash flow. In addition, cash reform in conjunction with the expected proceeds from the Synchrony transaction and its implication for our go forward cash requirements position PayPal with meaningful liquidity, flexibility and optionality as it relates to capital allocation decisions. We expect to continue to deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation to preserve this flexibility and make strategic investment to deliver durable increases in shareholder value and long term growth. In 2018, we planned to continue investing organically pursue acquisitions and partnerships and increase our level of stock repurchases. We are currently executing on tax planning strategies to serve our long term business objectives. The consequences of these strategies in conjunction with regional regulatory and liquidity requirements may affect our cash repatriation plans. We continue to move toward more optical capital structure to support capital allocation decisions and maximize value. In the fourth quarter, we announced a new $3 billion unsecured credit facility and drove down $1 billion at the end of December. I would now like to discuss our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 and the full year. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue between $15 billion and $15.25 billion representing currency neutral growth of 14% to 16%. This is in line with the guidance update we provided in mid-January and incorporates the expected impact of approximately 3.5 points through the sale of our U.S. consumer receivables. Our guidance contemplates modest expansion in our non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 and we anticipate non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 17% and 20% and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.24 to $2.30. For 2018, we anticipate free cash flow to exceed $4.5 billion. This is higher than normal due to the sale of our credit receivables next year. The proceeds of which will be split between operating and investment activities on our cash flow segment. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.58 billion to $3.63 billion or 20% to 21% growth on a currency neutral basis. We also expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.54. In closing we are pleased with 2017 and the progress we have made across many fronts. We focused our efforts on building great experiences to our customers which led to a record consumer enrichment patterns to our and an acceleration of revenue and earnings growth. We've demonstrated the stable improvements to our cost structure and significantly de-risked our business with the U.S. consumer credit transaction with Synchrony. We look forward to the opportunities we have in 2018 to continue this progress and further increase shareholders value. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Dan and John, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect between the way that eBay is presenting the new partnership or expansion versus the way that that it's coming across on this call in the press release, primarily that the difference being the Adyen partnership that their Adyen partnership that the eBay is talking about is being their primary partner now and that they intend to transition the majority of their marketplace customers to this new payment experience that Adyen's powering. Can you help clarify for us a little bit for how -- basically try and connect the dots between those two? And I know you've talked about they're not being any sort of meaningful financial impact here as we get to the end of the original 2020 date, how does that change? Dan Schulman : So I start off with just saying that eBay and PayPal have had a close relationship and a long history together. And I\u2019m really pleased that we're expanding that partnership on the branded through July 2023. As I think most people on the call know, there is a five-year operating agreement that governs our separation, and we're halfway through that, we\u2019ve got another 2.5 years left till the end of July 2020. And with this announcement, here there are no changes to any of the terms. And the operating agreement was meant to assure both the thoughtful and a smooth transition for both companies post-separation. And it assumed in the operating agreement that as have we, that eBay will gradually transition to become an MOR. And consequently all of our numbers, all of our plans have always included that assumption. So as we've given our medium-term guidance, that\u2019s a part of our assumption. And as a result, this announcement does not change our medium-term guidance or the way that we think about our long-term outlook. And let me give you some facts around that because we strongly believe that the eBay transition to MOR is quite manageable for us. So why do we think that? So today, eBay as John mentioned is about 13% of our TPV, our total process volume, transaction process volume and that down about 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years. So let's just assume that exactly the same thing happens over the next 2.5 years. And that we have no acquisitions of ourselves which finds way as you know we are acquisitive, we are aggressive on that. We had a large cash balances coming to us. So we can talk about acquisitions that will be a part of our strategy going forward. But assuming no acquisition, eBay becomes approximately, at the end of the operating agreement about 4% of our TPV. That\u2019s assuming again the same amount first 2.5 years to the second 2.5 years. And they give less than 10% of our revenues. If eBay is follows the example and we actually have the great insight because we actually see what happens to marketplaces as they go to MOR because we worked with a number of marketplaces. And where marketplaces go to MOR, it typically takes them several years before the majority of their moves MOR. And we\u2019ve seen this and we've experienced and host MOR, we still retain about a 50% share of check out, and so it takes several years post the end of the OA for the majority of customers to move that\u2019s with our experience that\u2019s been in the real market and post that we retain about 50% share of checkout. So, we think that this is going to be a very manageable transition over a multiple years post the end of OA. And I'll give you two more thoughts on this and it's very important. One, we renewed the branded relationship with eBay because it is far in a way the most profitable element of the relationship. And two, it\u2019s the most important to our usual customers. And three, it also happens to see a large part of the business as far in a way today. On branded processing, it is highly undifferentiated, it's commoditized and as a result it yields little to low profit. And as we go through this, we're going to be able to set substantial cost because we\u2019re going to be doing that unbranded piece of it. We'll still maintain the branded, we'll still maintain the most profitability part of this business and what is today the largest, but there is one other really important element, the OA, the operating agreement, also restricts PayPal from partnering with the largest and fastest growing market places in the world as an MOR. So, we\u2019ve simply done an extension of the full operating agreement that would keep that prohibition in place and prevented us from becoming a fully neutral third-party platform. And the opportunity to partner with the world largest market places is immense. Today, the top 10 market places that were allowed to fully service, generates tens and tens and tens of billions of dollars of TPV, growing at 56% year-over-year and this is just a fraction of what it could be. So, if you sum it all up for us. One, we always assumes MOR. It's in our guidance, it's in our plans. Two, we think there is going to be a very manageable transitions over multiple years, three it opens up a very large and very real opportunities for us to work with the largest next generation market place post the OA. And so all in this is the best thoughts for PayPal, we\u2019re now well position to continue our strong growth both on the top line and the bottom line actually look at. And so, we feel good about where all this is come out, we look that it very, very carefully, it's always been in our plans and we feel good, now that we have certainty on the direction that we're going. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I just want a follow-up on that. Just trying to understand -- my understanding is in 2020 that's when you guys will no longer be the MOR. And then just thinking about going forward then, my understanding is PayPal will still be a button of choice, but it just won't process some of the card payments. And just trying to figure out the economics, what that exactly means when you don't become the MOR? And how that impacts the P&L? Bill Ready : It's a great question. One of the things to understand that is, as we work with many other retailers out there, they are merchant of record as we work with them and as we are able to go command, even a premium relative to card processing because we deliver greater customer acquisition, higher conversion rates, all those things, we're doing that across much of our business with the merchants or marketplace and it's now functioning as a merchant for the record. So as Dan was commenting on earlier quite, a lot of insight into exactly how this plays out, and that led to us being able to fully contemplate that as we've laid our future plans and have been doing separation because we know how that works in other marketplaces and other small business forums and have either moved the merchant record or started the merchant record with PayPal still as a predominant way of paying inside of those marketplaces or small business forums. John Rainey : Bryan, this is John. I would add to that maybe that I think what you're getting to is sort of the economic impact overall and there's a couple of things that point you to. First is, as Dan has suggested in his prepared remarks that our -- in terms of their percentage of our business, it's declined 900 basis points, over the last couple of years. And during that period, we've actually been able to keep margins flat to growing, all right. And if you look at the 10 quarters that we've had, since separation, the average revenue growth of those quarters for our eBay part of our business has been 4%. If you look at the other 87% of our business that has grown 23%, so if you -- history is not necessarily -- you can't project that forward, but if you were just to take those numbers and project them through to mid 2020 at the end of the operating agreement, that would suggest that in 2021 our revenue growth each year is roughly 50% larger than the entire of the eBay business at that point in time. So, the other thing I'd point to is that we actually incur quite a cost to support eBay today. So, when we look at things like our losses or our call volumes into op center, those disproportionately skewed towards eBay relatively to their percentage of the TPV. So, we feel very confident that we can continue this trajectory going forward and there's nothing about what's been announced today that changes our thoughts and our ability to continue to grow our top line and bottom line after we operate it here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : A couple of follow-up questions to that, I am not sure if you could share, how much of your profits come from eBay today? But is your ability and your confidence to maintain your midterm guidance, does it require any sort of unusual mediation efforts like cost cutting or share repurchase like get the organic cost cutting or savings from the change? But just curious, if it requires any extra remediation efforts or even the assumption of new marketplace whence? And if I could just hack on one more, is it fair to think that your checkout share, the 50% numbers helpful. But it is fair to think that your checkout share would be higher longer term here just because of how integrated you\u2019ve been with eBay after all this year? Sorry for all the questions. Dan Schulman : So Tien-tsin, I\u2019ll start. The assumption that we have going forward is that, we will continue to realize the benefits from our scale and our leverage going forward. And so this is not required massive restructuring or layoffs to continue kind of performance that we seen; as I suggested, we\u2019ve been doing this for two years. And we would expect this. We continue to grow other parts of our business that we can continue to generate this kind of leverage. I\u2019ll point you back to the fact that half of our cost based this year and we\u2019re growing $0.10 for every incremental dollar. Now for other part of your question, does that assume like anything in terms of acquisitions anything like that? It does not and so we think about the -- and if you go back to my answer to Brian\u2019s question, and you think about losing some share of that business going forward. We\u2019re talking about a few points of impact to revenue growth of profitability and that can easily be backfill going out and looking at inorganic opportunities, and this doesn\u2019t also address the fact that with the operating agreement in the mid-2020. We now have the ability to go out and partner with the largest marketplaces in the world, largest and fastest growing market places in the world. All of these give us an opportunity to backfill, we kind of gap that we might have as we transition to this next chapter with eBay. John Rainey : Yes. And I think also say that our guidance assumed this. So what that means is that we knew this is going to happen and that guidance that we\u2019ve been giving in the medium-term guidance that we put out there has assumed this happening. So, that means that we've built into our models, costs and things that we know, we can target and take out revenues that we can target. So, this is not anything that we haven\u2019t covered in all of our modeling and all of our plans. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have been giving that medium term guidance. This isn't a surprise this is exactly what we assume, it was contemplated in the operating agreement and constantly, when I think about kind of the experiences we have, where eBay will be at the end of the operating agreement is multi-year transition and our place as they branded check-out solution. I feel like, this would be one of the events that will, that obviously will have to move, but it will be one of the quite manageable for us going forward. Dan Schulman : And one of the Tien-tsin, you talk about, one of the market places things like that. As Dan alluded to earlier and as you know, we\u2019re hiring payment platform for many of the best next gen marketplaces in the world already Uber, Airbnb and many others. But as Dan alluded to, not only that many tens of billions of dollars of volume for us and growing 50% plus already, that growths in that business as we think in our other large marketplaces. As growth we seen on an absolute basis is already outpacing the growth we see from eBay. So just the way, we\u2019re already engaging our marketplaces outpace of the growth that we see from eBay and as we are able to contemplate are engaging there and at an un-federal way we think there is a lot more opportunity ahead for us there. You touched one other points around share of checkout about being over penetrate to given our launch is for the relationship and we don\u2019t disclose specifics about the share of checkout that was certainly it's reasonable to expect as we see 50% approximately with other small business forum when we've been made and embedded overtime what would be a place where we yes or strongly preferred and if you've seen in our consumer base our engagement is going up consistently across our consumer base. So your point there about our share of checking all we tend to see that our consumers are using PayPal and becoming more engagement with us overtime now left and so their preference for PayPal is increasing and so we think that is goes well for us across any marketplace we work with and certainly as a big part of the branded deals we've done with eBay why that's important to both us and eBay is a continuity of how a significant portions the buyers have been choosing to personally on eBay for a very long time and like we will continue to into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Just on that point on these other partnerships that you can have with marketplaces. How many discussions that you had with some of the larger ones, that are opportunities? And how significant economically could those be road into sort of what you have with eBay? And then maybe just thinking about the transaction cost element of being a lesser merchant for the networks, does that have any impact to your interchange expenses? Dan Schulman : We've just had conversations with other marketplaces, as part of the operating agreement, we're prohibited from offerings MOR services to I don't name it -- to the largest consensus for our marketplaces that are out there that are really direct to competitors with these that was part of the operating agreement. Obviously, each of them have spoken with us, you've spoken to them, but they all know that we are respecting the terms of the operating agreement just as eBay does this well. And so, I do believe that those conversations are quite sincere, and they all do want to think about how they can work with us. But until we get closer to the end of DRA that's what we will be able to give you more about today's information everything out to this point is confidential. Operator : Our next question comes from James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. James Fawcett : I wanted to ask always the qualitative, an additional qualitative follow-up question on eBay. And I'm just wondering how we should think about then what maybe you had to agree to give or give up in terms of being able to secure the extra years of presence of as checkout on eBay and next so that you would have a presence there through 2023? And I guess as part of that, I'm curious like why agree to whatever now instead of waiting to see there were some additional services that PayPal can deliver to eBay that to improve your positioning in long-term relationship there? Dan Schulman : Yes. James, when we thought that within the OA, this year coming up versus first year that permitted eBay to experiment with MOR capabilities. It\u2019s laid out in the operating agreement as they can choose two countries and do up to 5% of the volume on an MOR solution. So it was the right time and we\u2019ve always thought that we\u2019d never do all these negotiations at the very end. We both feel like we\u2019re going to be partners for a long time and we looked carefully at all parts of this deal, both the unbranded and the branded. And we felt that the unbranded piece of this was not something that made sense for us. One because we felt the most profitable part of the business was on the branded side and it\u2019s the largest part of the business today. And number two, we in no way wanted to be restricted post the OA in terms of our ability to work with the largest marketplaces around the globe. So for us to be really -- we thought like we didn't give everything up, it\u2019s going to do this now. It was a natural extension. This is important to eBay, it\u2019s important to us that we both signal that we're going to be very close partners going forward. Bill Ready : Yes. I\u2019d just say on this point whatever given these things, it is as Dan was alluded to very much slightly with firm another large retailer. So when we serve large retailers, we certainly give them rates that are commensurate with their volumes. But we\u2019re not restricted in ways of how we would do that as of others or things like that. So it\u2019s very along the line of a standard commercial relationship that we would have regular retailer. Dan Schulman : I\u2019ll just add too one other thing, James. As it relates to the unbranded part of the business, volume is obviously important to us but so is profitability. And where this was ending up is something that we weren\u2019t interested in from a profitability perspective. We can certainly go acquire volume as we\u2019ve demonstrated each quarter since separation from many other places. And we have a lot of confidence and conviction in our ability to do that going forward and do it at more profitable rates than what this unbranded agreement would have been. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Paul Condra : I just wanted to -- can you just clarify a bit, I know that eBay, it sounds like they\u2019re starting this process now with Adyen. So I\u2019m wondering when are you actually no longer restricted to start looking partnerships of other marketplaces, and then my follow-up is just on a different topic. You did mention something about industry standard tokens in the point of sale setting, I wonder if you could just give a little bit more detail about that? Dan Schulman : Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then Bill can take the second part. So, we have the ability to partner with many of marketplaces as you probably know, here the underlying payment platform for Airbnb, for Uber and for others. But there was a set of eBay competitors that were carved out within the operating agreement, in which we could not serve them as an MOR. And that goes away at the end of the operating agreement. So at the end of July 2020 that restriction is lifted. So, and eBay has the ability to start to experiment with alternative PSPs beginning this year, so they can do up to 5% of volume in two countries they select and then that can go up to 10% within a volume within those two countries of the last year of the operating agreement. So they have a change to experiment. Just as we have chance to work with leading market places out there, it's just slow that we might think of this being competitive with eBay we then presented from working with them as part of their operating agreement and that makes sense for both of us as we separated from eBay. Bill Ready : So for in-store, what we were really like about there just is the continuation of our implementation of Visa and MasterCard took it and network standard tokens around our in-store offering. So, as we discussed previously, we work with GooglePay and with other around in-store efforts, and we\u2019re continuing to rollout our deployment of standard network tokens around those things consistent with RBs and MasterCard relationship that we previously announced. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi Ashwin Shirvaikar : CAN you comment on both the merchant and consumer engagement trends separately? And I think one related question is, it seems payment transactions and revenue per active are countered I mean higher, but the payment transaction per active account decelerated as well? And then would your answer change, if you separated out eBay or non eBay merchant engagement? Sorry for the multipart but just kind want to get there and get an idea of that. Dan Schulman : So in terms of the overall engagement, which grew by 8%, in my opening remarks I said if you normalize that anything that change to be decelerating is because we're bringing on so many net new actives in comparisons to the year before. And so when a new customer comes on we would bring them on throughout this year they obviously had it ramped up to the engagement levels that somebody is been here for a year or two have been. So when we take a look at it, we look at every one of those cohorts that came on and we look at their patient levels to 2017 works versus the 2016 co work that we brought on. And what we see is that our 2017 co work which was 20 over 29 million net new actives have more engagement than the cohort that we brought in 2016. So what that does, that bodes very well for the future of it as those large cohorts of net new actives that are more engaged there before start engaging with the platform overtime, that takes our engagement levels help. And so you would actually see from a double-digit increase and engagement if you normalize with the increase in net new actives. I think and on the other things we don't break those out, and so we just do a one number although I will say one thing we could also see that we're having acceleration in the number of merchants that are coming out of the PayPal platform as well. So, we now have 18 million merchants on the platform, that's also experienced the same type of growth as we've seen, with our merchant -- our consumer growth as well. Operator : Thank you. We've time for one last question from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Darrin Peller : Look I mean I know you're describing the eBay contribution to be relatively minor, but this rolls off obviously, give you a lot of opportunities. One, other things you mentioned was deploying capital to help diversify further. I guess I just wanted to hear more given you now post Synchrony deal tax reform, there should be a ton of cash available for you guys like a considerable some unlevered cash. So can you give us more color on potential thoughts around incremental buybacks they way you've done before? And then what kind of M&A, how fast, it's been a while since we've seen the material size M&A? John Rainey : It's John. So, in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, those haven't changed. Our top priority is always to invest for profitable growth and that can be both organic opportunities, and also be looking at the M&A landscape and we certainly do allude to given cash balance and the ability to move that across borders, that we can be much more aggressive there perhaps then we have in the past, we are pretty rigorous in looking at all of the different opportunities out there, but we're also pretty disciplined in making sure that there is the right return that creates shareholder value. So, you can expect us to be active there. At the same point in time, we fundamentally believe that returning cash to shareholders is absolutely a good thing. The thing that I would want to press upon you know is that, we don't feel pressured to go loud and do that immediately to try to show additional accretion or anything like that. Being measured and thoughtful in this area creates opportunities and it creates opportunities that over the long term could pay -- payback much more going out and for example taking a large chunk of our international cash and doing a stock buyback. So we believe there's a fine balance there and we'll do that and we'll acquire companies and return cash to shareholders as we -- when the time is right for all of those but you could expect us to be active on all of those fronts. Dan Schulman : And I'd just say that to add to John's point that, we are happy with the set of assets and capabilities we have today. We've got a very robust product pipeline, and we're ready to compete as the leader of the market and I think we're planning from the position strength. I have to agree with John. I think that our balance sheet is a strong weapon for us, 7 billion of cash, bringing in another 6 billion that strong free cash flow, each year, and we intend to stay resilient and be a consolidator in the industry. We do look at 100s of opportunities every quarter from small investments to larger ones, and as a set of criteria that we look at, we are very disciplined, needs to fit into our vision and mission and need to accelerate our progress across either key vertical and geography or some piece of technology that we don\u2019t have. But bottom-line expect this to be acquisitive, but as John said and both discipline and the thoughtful matter. Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for your time to joining us today. We really appreciate it and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. This concludes the program and you may disconnect now. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Sherrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings' earnings conference call for the first quarter 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations; and Bill Ready, our EVP Chief Operating Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Earlier this month, we announced updated definitions of active accounts and total payment volume or TPV to capture the diversification of PayPal's products and services through strategic partnerships, new products and acquisitions. The rates of growth discussed on this call related to these metrics reflect revised results from prior year periods for comparability. We do not consider the historical impacts of the updated definitions to be material. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 25, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to say that PayPal had another quarter of strong results and we are off to a great start for the year. We generated 3.69 billion of revenue in Q1, growing at 24% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis. We delivered 829 million in non-GAAP operating income, that's up 29% year-over-year, driven by 90 basis point increase in our non-GAAP operating margin, which was 22.5% for the quarter. As a result, we delivered $0.57 of non-GAAP EPS, up 29% year-over-year. We also had another quarter of strong customer growth and engagement. We added 8.1 million net new actives, up 35% year-over-year, bringing our total active accounts to 237 million. This strong performance was driven by continued growth of core PayPal and Venmo users and our Customer Choice initiative. Choice continues to produce strong customer activations and the year-over-year reduction in our overall churn rate. We expanded the global roll out of Choice by launching in China and nine additional countries across Southeast Asia and further expanding and further expanding into Europe by launching in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Following the addition of a record 29 million net new actives in 2017, we're pleased to see continued strength in our customer acquisition. We remain confident that net new actives for this year will be in line with the record additions we experienced last year. And as our consumer base expands, the growth of merchants signing up to our platform is also accelerating. Our merchant base now totals 19 million accounts. This powerful network effect along with continued improvements to our technology platform and enhancements in our product experiences continues to drive increasing engagement. PayPal ended the first quarter with 34.7 transactions per active account, up once again by 8%. Our efforts to redefine our ecosystem with landmark partnerships, the introduction of new products and services and the continued expansion of our global footprint led to strong volume growth. PayPal processed 132 billion in TPV in the quarter, up 32% on a spot basis and up 27% on a currency neutral basis. On an FX-neutral basis our merchant services TPV grew at five times the rate of our eBay market places TPV. There's no doubt that we are benefiting from the explosion of mobile and as cards finding impact on the digitization of commerce and all forms of currency. We're executing against a focused and strategic plan intended to maximize the benefit of these trends and extend our market leadership. We're clearly transforming from a payments button to an open digital payments platform. And by doing so we're redefining our relationship with partners, retailers and consumers in a much more expansive manner. We continue to grow our relationships with technology platforms and companies across the globe as well as with card networks and issuing banks. Through these partnerships, we are able to increase our addressable market as well as accelerate the introduction of innovative payment experiences. For instance, our relationship with Visa continues to strengthen around the world as we collaborate on multiple initiatives, including tokenization and the increasing use of their services like Visa OCT for instant cash out. JP Morgan Chase added PayPal as a new category for its freedom rewards members, allowing then to earn up to 5% cash back when making PayPal purchases funded by their Chase freedom card. We introduced two new experiences with Bank of America, one that enables PayPal as a way to disperse payments on behalf of their corporate clients and another that provides the away customers a streamlined way to link their debit and credit cards to their PayPal accounts from their Bank of America mobile and online channels. We announced partnership agreements with CaixaBank and Bankia, two of the leading banks in Spain. CaixaBank's business customers can now seamlessly offer PayPal as a way to pay on their websites. Helping Spanish SMB's [ph], participate more fully in Spain's growing ecommerce market. Bankia, now enables its customers to seamlessly link their Bankia cards to their PayPal wallet and open a PayPal account from Bankia's online channels. HSBC announced a new integrated service to allow their corporate customers to make payments to beneficiaries with PayPal accounts in the UK. And this partnership will be rolling out across Europe throughout 2018. And Barclays Bank, one of the largest banks in the UK is announcing a strategic partnership with us that will enable their UK and US customers to more easily link their accounts to their PayPal wallet. US Barclays' credit card holders will soon be able to use their reward points as a funding source in their PayPal wallet. We're pleased to be working with all of our partners to roll out compelling and engaging experiences. Our financial institution partners are now experiencing, first hand, the benefits of our joint efforts. It's exciting to see them actively encouraging their customers to link their accounts to PayPal in order to enrich the digital experiences available to our mutual customers. In our relationships with some of the world's largest technology platform partners like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, continue to expand and grow in the quarter. These experiences allows for PayPal to be more present in the everyday lives of our customers, driving engagement as well as introducing millions of potential new customers to the PayPal brand and value proposition. For instance, last year we announced an expanded agreement with Samsung and I'm pleased to share that in the next few weeks, users will be able to load PayPal into Samsung pad, enabling our mutual customers to pay with their phone at millions of retailers in the US. We also continue to innovate around our core platform capabilities. For instance, P2P has increasingly become a powerful driver of customer acquisition and engagement on our platform. We continue to see record levels of customer acquisition through P2P and Venmo as we continue to innovate and consequently differentiate the services we offer. Venmo continues to gain increasing traction as preferred way for millennials to manage and move their money. Venmo acquired more net new actives in Q1 than in any previous quarter and processed 12.3 billion in payment volume, up over 80% versus last year. Venmo is now on a run rate to generate over 50 billion in TPV in 2018. We're making strong progress in monetizing Venmo. Pay with Venmo has deployed more than 2 million merchants across the US with major brands such as Grubhub, Seamless and Williams-Sonoma, installing dedicated pay with Venmo button. We expect the deployment of a distinct Venmo button with our leading brands will accelerate throughout the year, as well the deployment of dynamic buttons. The use of convenient instant cash out capabilities at a fee of $0.25 per transaction is dramatically accelerating across the Venmo consumer base. Overall adoption of monetized services is exceeding our original expectations. One Touch continues to set the standard for speed and simplicity for mobile check out. We concluded the quarter with 92 million consumers using One Touch and 8.6 million merchants. We're proud that 78% of the IR-100 now use One Touch, enabling mobile check out conversions at almost two times the industry average. In fact the latest comp score study now states PayPal's conversion has further improved to 89% by far in a way the leader in mobile check out. We processed 49 billion in mobile payment volume in the quarter, up 52% year-over-year and mobile payments now represent 37% of our total payment volume. Credit is and will continue to be a strategic part of PayPal's offering to consumers and businesses. It is an important way that we help small and midsized businesses compete, grow and thrive. I'm pleased to announce that PayPal working capital has now extended more than 5 billion in working capital to more 150,000 merchants since its launch in 2013. In the quarter, we also launched new services to give our customers more flexibility in how and where they can spend, manage and move their money on the PayPal platform. As the world becomes increasingly digital too many consumers are challenged by gaps in the current financial system to find convenient and affordable ways to manage their financial health. We recently introduced the PayPal cash master card aimed at giving greater financial flexibility to underserved and unbanked consumers in the United States. It lets card holders spend their PayPal bonds at millions of physical store locations, access cash from ATMs and load their PayPal account with cash at over 20,000 retail locations. Consumers can also add to their balance via direct deposit as well as depositing checks via their mobile device. We're working closely with partners across the financial ecosystem to introduce what will be a comprehensive value proposition for the tens of millions of US consumers that currently rely on shadow banking services like check cashers and pay their lenders. It is the central tenant of our mission to provide underserved consumers better access to the opportunities afforded by the digital economy and I'm very pleased that we're taking the first steps on this journey. Around the world, we continue to expand and grow our relationships and footprint. We've introduced advanced capabilities to accelerate our ability to onboard new sellers on AliExpress in order to expand the selection of products available to shoppers around the globe. We now have approximately half of all AliExpress active sellers accepting PayPal as a way to pay. In addition, we're excited to launch our partnership with BYJU in the coming months. We've now successfully moved from pilot to general availability of PayPal for domestic customers in India. We're now pleased to welcome merchants across India to offer PayPal to local consumers in India as well as to our millions of consumers around the globe. We recently announce the partnership with M-Pesa, the transformative mobile payment system in Kenya. Through our relationship, Kenyans can now seamlessly move money between their M-Pesa and PayPal accounts, removing barriers that had prevented Kenyan consumers and businesses from fully participating in the global digital economy. Kenyan consumers can now shop the millions of global businesses that accept PayPal and Kenyan businesses can sell to PayPal's consumers around the world. With almost 28 million M-Pesa customers in Kenya, we see this as a meaningful step forward in working with partners to drive the democratization of financial services. Finally, we have formalized a signed contract with eBay through July 2023 to extend our branded relationship. We're actively working with Devin Wenig and his team to deepen our relationship in ways that drive profitable growth for both companies. It's my belief that eBay and PayPal will continue to be close strategic partners for the foreseeable future and we're committed to that outcome. As we shared previously, this gradual transition in our relationship with eBay was anticipated by both parties and was outlined in the original operating agreement. Consequently, it does not change either our short or medium term financial values. We're pleased that the opportunity to extend our strategic relationship with eBay. While at the same time expand our ability to partner with some of the world's fastest growing market places. Based on numerous direct conversations, we know that our rapidly expanding two sided network and our increasing platform capabilities are very attractive to our host of next generation market places. And they're looking forward to deepening their strategic relationship with us. After a strong 2017, it's encouraging to enter 2018 with continued momentum in the seer strategy delivering results on multiple fronts. Our merchants, consumers and partners will always remain at the heart of everything we do and I'd like to extend my thanks to the entire PayPal team for their consistent dedication to our customers. We still have much to accomplish and as always a lot of hard work ahead, but the opportunity for us to make a real difference in the lives of so many of our customers has never been greater. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks Dan. In the first quarter we outperformed on both revenue and earnings, building on our momentum from 2017. [indiscernible] across active accounts, payment volume and revenue demonstrates the strength of our two sided platform. And our ability to grow operating income while expanding operating margin highlights the sustainable scalability of our model. During the quarter, we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives and at the same time delivered strong earnings growth. Before I go into detailed financial results, a few highlights for the quarter, revenue was $3.69 billion, growing 24% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $0.57. During the quarter we also returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 23.6 million shares as part of our buyback program. Consistent with Q4 '17 as a result of the sale of our US consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Financial and the associated reclassification of the receivables to held for sale, there are changes to the presentation of our results. These changes reduce comparability to prior periods. Where relevant to the discussion, I'll provide normalized results to adjust for these changes. Following the closing of the transaction, which we expect to occur early Q3, the US consumer credit portfolio will no longer sit on our balance sheet. We will no longer incur any direct cost related to the charge offs of principal for interest. This reclassification affects three areas on our income statement. First, revenue from other value added services benefited by approximately $38 million in the quarter as a result of no longer recognizing reserves on interest receivables; second, transaction and loan losses benefited by approximately $111 million from no longer recognizing reserves on principle receivables and third, non-transaction related expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $128 million from the recognition of incurred charge offs on principle and interest. Turning to our financial performance in the first quarter, our total payment volume was $132 billion, up 27% on a currency neutral basis, including US payment volume growth of 28% and international volume growth of 25%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $116 billion. Volume associated with eBay grew 6% on a currency neutral basis to $17 billion. P2P volume, which is a component of merchant services and includes volumes across core Venmo and Zoom, grew 50% to $30 billion and represented approximately 23% of total payment volume versus 20% in Q1 '17. In the first quarter, we added 8.1 million net new active accounts, ending with 237 million active accounts, representing 15% growth over Q1 last year. On the consumer side, active account growth was predominantly driven by core PayPal and Venmo and we added nearly 900,000 merchants to our platform. The number of payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12 months basis reached 34.7 with 8.2 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. In the first quarter, transactions once again grew 25% to 2.2 billion. Revenue increased 24% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis to $3.69 billion. US revenue increased 26% versus Q1 '17 and international revenue increased 18% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. Revenue growth on a currency neutral basis accelerated nearly 3.5% from strength in our US and APAC businesses, including our acquisition of Swift Financial. Overall, our total revenue benefited from the weaker dollar by $91 million, with $141 million of translation benefits, partially offset by $50 million of hedging losses. This $50 million hedging loss compares to $40 million gain last year. In the first quarter transaction revenue grew 22% and revenue from other value added services grew 39%. Transaction revenue growth was driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, while revenue from other value added services benefited from the acquisition of Swift and from the reclassifications related to held for sale accounting. Adjusting for these events, other value added services revenue grew at approximately the same rate as transaction revenues. For Q1, our transaction take rate was 2.42%, a decline of 19 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. And our total take rate was 2.78%, down 17 basis points year-over-year. Almost half of the decline in take rate is related to the $90 million headwind from hedging losses. This combined with the growth in our P2P businesses led by Venmo contributed to more than 75% of the transaction take rate decline with the remainder being driven by business mix. Volume based expenses grew 23% in Q1. Transaction expense was $1.3 billion and represented 96 basis points of TPV, a decrease of 2 basis points year-over-year. Funding mix pressure was offset by lower funding costs from growth in P2P. Transaction loss in the quarter was $243 million or 18 basis points of TPV, an increase of 1 basis point versus the same period a year ago. This 1 basis point increase relates to the introduction of new products and services where we look to balance our risk tolerance with our growth plans. Loan losses were $62 million or 5 basis points as a rate of TPV, down more than 50% from Q1 '17 as a result of the effect of held for sale accounting. For modeling purposes, we expect loan losses to be in the range of 5 basis points as a rate of TPV for the year. Transaction margin dollars grew 25% to $2.1 billion. Adjusted for the impact of held for sale accounting transaction margin dollar were $2 billion, representing 16% growth versus last year. For the quarter, transaction margin as a rate was 57.1%. Adjusting for held for sale accounting, transaction margin was 53.6%. Non-transaction related expenses grew 22% in the quarter. Normalizing for the held for sale accounting adjustments, these expenses would have grown approximately 10% resulting in 365 basis points of operating leverage. Further adjusting for our 2017 acquisitions, we would have seen non-transactional related expenses grow at 6.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our target of mid-single digit growth. After adjusting for held for sale accounting treatment and backing out incremental revenue and cost associated with our acquisitions from last year, these expenses increased only $0.11 for every incremental dollar of revenue. We believe that we can sustainably grow our business with this level of investment in our non-transactional related expenses, allowing us to continue to deliver operating margin expansion. In the first quarter, operating income grew 29% to $829 million on 24% top-line growth. This resulted in an operating margin of 22.5% or 90 basis points of operating leverage. It's worth noting. This is the highest operating margin we've reported as an independent company. Adjusting for held for sale accounting and acquisitions, operating income grew 29% to $833 million delivering organic margin expansion of approximately 100 employee basis points. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 29% in the first quarter to $0.57. Capital expenditures were $178 million or approximately 5% of revenue. As a result of changes from the designation of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, net new loans of $1.26 billion reduced cash flow from operations in the quarter. Prior to this change in designation, this amount would have been recognized in cash flows from investing activities. As a result, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was negative $349 million with free cash flow of negative 500 in $27 million. But on a normalized basis, we would have recognized $733 million in free cash flow generating approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7.8 billion. In addition, we ended the quarter with short-term borrowings of $3 billion drawing down on our unsecured credit facility. During Q1 we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2018 and our updated guidance for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $3.83 billion or 19% or 20% growth on a currency neutral basis. We also expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.56 representing an 18% to 23% growth. Before I discuss full year 2018 guidance, I would like to discuss a change to our GAAP EPS outlook for the year. We now expect GAAP EPS to be within the range of $1.73 to $1.76. This updated outlook reflects a $19 million increase in our estimate for non-GAAP adjustments. Approximately two-thirds of this increase is attributable to additional stock-based compensation based on our financial outperformance. The remaining third is from a restructuring charge that we recognized in the quarter related to reductions of our global workforce and the decision to wind down TIO Networks operations, which was not in our original guidance. For the full year 2018 based on current trends, we are raising our revenue outlook by $175 million at the midpoint of our prior range. We now expect revenue between $15.2 billion and $15.4 billion representing current neutral growth of 15% to 16%. We expect our sale for Synchrony of approximately $6 billion of US consumer credit receivables to close early in the third quarter. Following the completion of this sale, we will no longer recognize revenue from interest and late fees related to this portfolio. Overall we continue to estimate a 3.5 percentage point impact to 2018 revenue growth from this transaction. We expect revenue from other value-added services to decline in the back half of 2018 relative to 2017. At the same time transaction revenue is on track to continue growing at approximately 20%. Our full year 2018 guidance contemplates modest expansion in our non-GAAP operating margin. We continue to balance delivering operating margin expansion with reinvesting back into the business to further strengthen our platform and competitive positioning. Given our growth opportunities, we have a bias toward investing. We are also narrowing our range for non-GAAP effective tax rate and now estimated to be between 17% and 19% and we are raising non-GAAP earnings per share to $2.31 to $2.34 representing 22% to 23% growth. To wrap up, our first quarter results position us well for another year of strong financial performance. I would like to thank all of our employees, customers, and partners for a great quarter. And with that I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks so much. So that for me was the level of buyback that you guys executed in Q1. It looks like it was mostly 80% or more than what you bought in all of '17. So I'm curious is this PayPal just being more opportunistic or is this sort of a signal of your capital allocation priorities, maybe shipping the buyback or you are not seeing the adequate returns on potential M&A, any kind of comment there would be great? Thanks. John Rainey : Sure, Tien-tsin. This is John. Our priorities have not changed. We still prioritize capital allocations first as investing for growth and that can be either organically or through M&A activity, but we also believe in returning cash to shareholders. This so happens that in the first quarter we had clarity on a couple of important issues. One is tax reform. The other is the transaction that we announced with Synchrony and that allowed us to do more than what we have done in the past. But very importantly, a strong balance sheet for us is a strong competitive advantage. It's an asset that a lot of our peers don't have and we believe as a management team improving that cash to use to create shareholder value and you'll continue to see us allocate capital in that manner whether it's returning cash to shareholders and going out and looking at the M&A landscape. I would not read anything into the amount of the share buyback as to suggest if there are not opportunities for us to go acquire companies. As you can appreciate those take time to complete a deal if not as if you can just start something and close the transaction in the quarter and so we will be measured and do what's right for PayPal and allocate capital in a manner that create shareholder value. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up then maybe just on the - Dan listed a bunch of bank promotions. Just curious are you funding some of these initiatives with the banks and I'm curious what kind of early returns you might be seeing that maybe hasn't shown up in the P&L so far in Q1? Dan Schulman : Bill? Bill Ready : Yeah, this is Bill. Hi, Tien-tsin. So we don't disclose the details of any one of those partnerships specifically. However, what we are seeing is tremendous receptivity from our banking partners to really drive their customers into PayPal because of the great source of digital transaction growth which was the primary place where issuers are growing right now and we are seeing really good response from the programs that are out there and they've been a tremendous support for us as well as for our issuing partners and so we are not committing any kind of unnatural acts to get those things to happen. In fact, our banking partners have found it very much to be in their interest to promote their customers to use PayPal. So we see that as something that is certainly indicative of the partnership, but also something we are not committing unnatural acts to make those things happen. Tien- tsin Huang : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the move to the unreserved or, to go after the unbanked, what are some of the puts and takes on revenue and cost resulting from offering more comprehensive financial services? Dan Schulman : Yeah, maybe I'll start off Byan with the answer on that and thanks for the question and then I'll turn it over to Bill on that. So first of all, we firmly believe as a company that everyone should have access to affordable convenient secure and low cost financial services. I mean that is our vision of marketizing financial services and we are working closely with the rest of the financial services ecosystem to do that. I mean think about the partners we have in there right now, MasterCard, Wells Fargo, Bank Corps just to name some of them. And I think what we are trying to do is not try to compete or replace what's going on with banks, but work with the financial system to fill in the gaps in the current system, so that everyone can afford the opportunities that the digital economy is extending. If you think about the way that we are putting services into place, we are trying to be a consumer champion, provide for instance our PayPal Cash MasterCard with no monthly fee, no minimum, because that is being differentiated in the marketplace. And the money we make from that is on transactions that occur at merchants just like we do typically. So we think that we can use technology reimagine financial services for sort of a mobile first customer and provide not only a great consumer value proposition but also a great proposition from merchants and the rest of the ecosystem as we bring people into the digital economy. Bill, do you want to? Bill Ready : Yeah and I would just add to that to your question on what it means for us on economics. We've had some products in market for a while that give us exposure to how these products are, one, used by customers and, two, what those mean to us financially both prepaid cards we've had in market for a while, merchant debit cards, things like that. And so there is no material difference in the way we would look to go monetize those customers and we've also had things for the unreserved such as being a little walk-in to a retail location like [indiscernible] for example and the cash onto PayPal accounts for somebody in the unreserved or unbanked community to participate in the digital economy. We've had exposure to those things and we don't see this as being any material difference in the way we would monetize on those customers versus how we monetize across the rest of our business. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. And then just as a follow-up, the increase in the merchant count, is there something you guys are doing recently that's driving up merchant acceptance up to 19 million or just more a function of Venmo getting out more, PayPal getting out more and being kind of a separate paying entity has got the attention of numerous additional merchants? Dan Schulman : Yeah, I think, look, probably the number one thing there is really a tipping point that we've reached from kind of a network effect perspective and we now have 237 million people on the platform. And as John mentioned, some 900,000 merchants this quarter signed up. We've been seeing that run rate as you have been hearing us talk about the number of merchants and so there is a great flywheel effect that happens. The other thing that I would point out is that more and more consumers are using mobile as their primary device to shop. And the real big issue for merchants with mobile is that mobile conversion with a mobile phone is typically low. These people have to add in a ton of information on that small phone factor, but with our One Touch and our conversion rate now at 89% from mobile checkout and then One Touch is two times, maybe two times plus, the industry average and that obviously is a great thing for consumers, but an essential thing for merchants. And I think that combination of those things, plus we are obviously adding more and more capabilities for small and midsize merchants, working capital being one that I talked about that, but we have a whole host of services that we are expanding through our platform as being just - as opposed to being just a payment button that is attracting not just consumers but an acceleration of merchants as well. Bryan Keane : Okay. Thanks so much. Congrats on the solid results. Dan Schulman : Thank you. Bill Ready : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. Dan Schulman : Hi, George. George Mihalos : Hey guys. Let me add my congrats on the strong results. Dan, just wanted to start off, there's obviously been a lot of - I really wonder on the market around the networks Visa MasterCard perhaps embracing sort of their own universal checkout button if you will. Maybe you can kind of address that as it relates to PayPal's positioning. Dan Schulman : Yeah. Let me first [indiscernible] on this. Our relationships with the networks could not be stronger. We - just every single quarter we find more and more places where we can work together, combine their services and capabilities with our platform and offer incremental value to both merchants and consumers and very importantly throughout their issuing partners and financial institutions. And you are seeing that through all of the partnerships that is just reflecting as I was writing my script on just this one quarter you've seen all of those banking partners working as Bill said very closely with us observing the firsthand the benefits that come from working hand in hand together for our mutual customers and so it's been a great partnership, a strong partnership and a growing partnership. In terms of the button specifically, I think Bill can talk a little bit about that and then I have a couple of comments on them. Bill Ready : Sure. On the specific new news there, it was really about sort of interoperability between the paying buttons offered by the networks. And we have for quite a while now talked about how we want to go help power the complete move to digital buy button experiences and not only do we have PayPal and Venmo as those widely used for digital payment forms in the world, we also are one of the largest providers to other digital wallet form of the payment whether that's Visa Checkout or MasterPass or Apple Pay and Google Pay. So we work with those others. Even as we work with those others, we are seeing that our own buy buttons continue to accelerate and so we really want to power the entire movement towards seamless digital wallet buying experiences and happy to partner those to do that. And this new news around interoperability is sort of a new technical specification. But interoperability between Visa Checkout and MasterPass and some of these existed previously that you can put a MasterCard into Visa Checkout or Visa card into MasterPass. So there is a new technical certification there. But interoperability between those checkout forms is not meaningfully different than how we have seen those previously and we are excited to continue working with our network partners to help them with those efforts, as well as the many ways we're partnering on how we each advance digital payments. George Mihalos : Great, I appreciate that. And then John, maybe just a quick follow-up, I think margins expanded, call it about 90 bps year-over-year in the first quarter, should we expect that to come down a little bit just looking at the $0.56 high end of the EPS guide for 2Q? John Rainey : With any one period there is going to be seasonality or things in the business move around. I would really point you to the full year results. We do make discretionary investments from one period to the next, but if you look at the implied guidance for our full year it still shows us expanding margins at a nice rate. I think it's reflective of the overall progress in the business. This is, as I noticed in my prepared remarks, we had a record operating margin in the quarter. We've had four consecutive quarters of accelerating revenue growth. For the last three quarters, we've averaged 30% EPS growth and 25% growth in transactions. So I'm really pleased with how the business is doing. George Mihalos : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from [Indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us a little more color or granularity on Venmo? You've mentioned a couple of times including on this earnings call that it's tracking sort of above your expectations. If you had to adjust the input in your full year guidance, is that any type of a driver in the near term or any incremental color you can give us around Venmo monetization would be appreciated? Bill Ready : Sure. This is Bill. So as was mentioned, we saw continued strong growth in Venmo up 80% on the quarter to $12.3 billion in volume and our biggest new year's quarter ever for Venmo. In addition to that, as you were calling out, we are quite pleased with our monetization efforts there and those really are along multiple fronts. One in adding new merchants that accept Venmo, we saw some great brands come into the pool with Grubhub, Seamless, Eat24, Williams-Sonoma, [indiscernible] and many others in addition to the 2 million plus retailers that we had already brought in through linking Venmo into its broader PayPal network. So we are really feeling great about what we are seeing in terms of merchants' receptivity and desire to connect to the demographics that love them so much, as well as the other aspect is our monetizing through things like instant cash out where we earn $0.25 fee for giving instant access to funds out to a participating Visa or MasterCard debit card. So those things are tracking better than our expectations. We're quite pleased overall. I defer to John in terms of the guidance question, but very much tracking, better than our prior expectations. John Rainey : Yeah. And with respect to the increase in both our revenue and our earnings guidance, guide is not directly attributable to Venmo. It's simply too early on at this point to get out of ourselves. And as - and Bill and Dan and I have talked about many times. We believe that what's important here is the long game. This is a tremendous opportunity to connect with this demographic and monetize it, but we don't want to be so impatient about that that we totally experience long term and so we have the luxury of being able to invest in this and get the experience right given our overall financial performance. The increase in guidance for earnings and revenue was really a reflection of the overall strength in the core business. Dan Schulman : Yeah. And I would just add to it. I mean we've talked a lot about this, but I think the best metaphor for Venmo is PayPal. I think PayPal has started off as a P2P service, then expanded in the eBay merchants and then into merchants around the world. I think what we are seeing is adoption by merchants and by consumers that's ahead of what we were expecting. But as John said, we think there is a lot of room here on Venmo and we would be cautious with our expectations around that so far. I have to say we are all pretty pleased with what we are seeing. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. A quick follow-up and maybe this one is for John. In the context of the changes to your GAAP earnings guidance, can you just comment on your go forward trends with stock-based compensation? Are you expecting any changes of cadence or any changes to your prior thinking around that level going forward? John Rainey : Sure. I appreciate the question. We don't other than what we have already noted and just as a reminder we made some changes when we separate from eBay to have our own compensation program, not eBay's compensation program. The effects of those changes were mostly realized in last year with the exception of the change in the vesting cycle related to that. So that is - you do see that a little bit in our results. But if you take - if you just look at the guidance range we provided for share based compensation this year, I think it's assuming around 18% growth. By the same token if you look at our GAAP operating income growth and I'm adjusting for held for sale, because that just creates noise. That's closer to 26% growth for the year. So some of the bigger impacts we were seeing last year and directly to answer your question, we are not anticipating further changes going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks so much. John Rainey : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Security. Jeff Cantwell : Hi, good afternoon. John Rainey : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Cantwell : Good results and I just wanted to ask you about your bank partnership strategy that you called out this quarter and over the past few quarters or so. Can you just remind us is there provision of a strategy to lower your customer acquisition cost or your funding costs, or maybe you can just talk to us a little bit about what the pieces about bank partnership strategy that you find most important? Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yeah. I'll start off and then Bill can fill in the color. I think first remember Jeff, the start of a choice where we are giving consumers full optionality to choose on every transaction how they want to pay and as a result of that really opened up the opportunity to work very closely with all the financial networks and the financial institutions issuing partners. Everybody is routed around choice. That's the right thing for consumers and everybody agrees that's the right strategy. As a result of that, as you can see in our TPV growth of, what's called 30%, that's very, very attractive to the issuing partners. There is no reason as many of them have said directly to Bill and I when we were in conversations at the very highest levels of management within those institutions. There is no reason why we shouldn't be the largest digital distribution partner on that because we can drive incremental growth for them on mobile checkout. Statistics are two times the industry average and our growth is multiple times out of the industry average and as a result of that they are actively linking their customers and encouraging them to get PayPal to go either established PayPal account or link their cards into an existing PayPal account. So obviously that drives acquisition for us, very low cost acquisition. At the same time, remember, they were signed to add additional capabilities to us as well. Most of those deals not all of those deals include access to tokens as well, so that you can start to move offline. We have network tokens and the issuing tokens for the instruments so that we can start to embed tokenization in an offline capability within our application and as we've mentioned before you can assume that that's going to be something that we will do as we look forward. They are also doing things that I think are really powerful for our mutual ecosystem by putting rewards points into their PayPal balance. What does that do for their consumers? It allows them to spend their rewards points at our 19 million merchants. For consumers it's a simple easy way to utilize those reward points or maybe there are other ways that were less easy for them. And for us it's a low cost funding mechanism and a real value add for our consumers. And so there are multiple different ways that this partnership works and it really - it's moved from being kind of an uneasy front of me environment two years ago to really being one in which we are all, I would say, very close allies in more of the war on cash and the advancement of digitization together. Anything to add? Jeff Cantwell : Great and then can you just talk to us a little bit about PayPal and bitcoin functionality in the wallet? I'm trying to understand what the big picture thinking is with bitcoin and blockchain, so you can file some blockchain related patents recently. Maybe you can just give us a sense of your blockchain strategy and what the longer term to think in this way? Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yeah, of course. Thanks for the question. Obviously hot topic that everybody talks about, here is what I would say on that. I would say we are excited about the long term potential blockchain and what it might be able to do in terms of distributed trusted applications and when I say that I don't just mean crypto. I mean things like identity and how to protect identity in different and new ways using things like blockchain. So as you saw from our patent filing, we have a number of initiatives underway where we are exploring from a long term perspective how we might utilize blockchain in innovative ways to create value propositions that may be even better than what we have today. But I'll tell you blockchain is still in the very first standings. I mean it's just realized at - for many of these things there are limitations not just in sort of the cryptocurrencies on top that are quite still volatile, which doesn't make for a good currency when things are volatile. And there are also limitations in things like transactions process per second in terms of blockchain and how fast you can process those transactions, how long it takes to wait for the completion of that transaction. So we've experimented with coin base and others in terms of direct connection to crypto currencies. Right now we do not support directly crypto currencies. We don't see the demand for it from our merchants or our consumers. But that should not be any indication that we don't see nor are we excited about the potential of blockchain in the long run. Bill, anything you would add to that? Jeff Cantwell : Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Dan Schulman : Yeah, you bet. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one last question and that is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great, thank you. Looking at the growth that you saw, the upsize growth you saw in P2P this quarter, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of sort of how this is impacting your funding mix, what kind of benefits that you are seeing from that when we look at the relatively stable cost of funding over the - on a year-over-year basis and in the financials how we should think about what's going on with mix there and the individual costs of the different funding channels you have? John Rainey : Sure. Heath, this is John. So you are framing the question I think in the appropriate way and that we are seeing - there is a lot of puts and takes to funding mix, but very importantly where there is inflation in the wallet that's being offset by more P2P usage. That said, if we were to look at this even stripping out P2P just looking at the rest of PayPal, there is not big swings. We are talking about a basis point or two here or there. So even adjusting for the growth in P2P, we are still pretty comfortable with this level of transaction expense from a BPD basis and you will probably remember I noted I believe it was the second quarter last year that we had a high point about 100 basis points and I said that I expected it to come down to this range and really giving everything that we have going on in the business, we will expect it to kind of stay in this range for certainly the next year to two sort of the - for us we have good line of sighting too and not change principally. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Heath for that question. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time. We know there's a lot going on today and look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Sheri. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings' earnings conference call for the second quarter 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO, John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations, and Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer. We are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for third quarter and full year 2018, our medium term guidance and the impact and timing of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date July 25, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had another strong quarter. As I said at our Investor Day, PayPal\u2019s greatest potential lies ahead of us and I believe the moves we made this past quarter position us to win in multiple segments of our total addressable market. At the same time, we also continue to produce consistent and strong quarterly financial results. In Q2, we generated $3.86 billion of revenue, growing at 23% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis. We delivered $820 million in non-GAAP operating income, up 24% year-over-year, driven by our non-GAAP operating margin of 21.3%, which was up 25 basis points from last year. And we delivered $0.58 of non-GAAP EPS, up 28% year-over-year. These results set us up for a strong second half of the year and consequently we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. We had another quarter of strong customer growth and engagement. We added 7.7 million net new actives with new user growth up 18% year-over-year. This brings our total active accounts to 244 million. Engagement on our platform increased 9% to just under 36 times per year, up from 33, a year ago. For the first half of the year, our net new actives equaled almost 16 million and we anticipate adding over 30 million net new actives for the year. Our continued customer growth and engagement is driven in part by the success of three important areas of focus, our Customer Choice initiatives; our partnership strategy; and our focus on always being the customer champion. Our commitment to Customer Choice continues to yield strong results. Today almost 85% of our active customers have Choice available to them and more than 45 million PayPal customers have adopted Choice. We anticipate Choice will be live in more than 200 countries by year-end. Since we implemented Choice, calls per transaction into our contact centers are now at their lowest level since we began tracking this metric more than seven years ago. In addition, we see a meaningful lift in engagement when our customers use Choice. Choice has also unleashed productive relationships with key strategic partners across the globe. PayPal increased our presence in the U.K. and India through partnerships with Santander, Clydesdale, and HDFC Bank. Each of those financial institutions will now enable their customers to easily link their bank issued cards to their PayPal Wallet and open a PayPal account from their online channels. We continue to build on our strategic partnership with South Korean credit card issuer ShinhanCard, where customers can now use an easy registration process to open a PayPal account through the ShinhanCard app and will receive a cash back reward from ShinhanCard for using PayPal. Our relationship with Google continues to deliver more streamlined payment experiences. We announced this quarter that users in the US who add PayPal to any one of Google's services will soon be able to pay across the Google ecosystem anywhere that PayPal is offered as a payment method. For example when a user adds PayPal to their Google Play account, it will automatically enable their linked PayPal account to be a payment option across popular Google services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Pay and Google Store, including where Google offers peer to peer payments. We strengthened our partnership with eBay. We signed an agreement to extend our long standing consumer financing offer to eBay's marketplace. With this agreement, eBay will continue to accept and promote PayPal Credit through 2025. We are fully committed to being the ultimate Customer Champion company. Our focus on putting customer\u2019s first and delivering exceptional experiences has created meaningful customer trust and deep loyalty to the PayPal brand. According to a recent ComScore study 52% of mobile consumers said they made more online purchases because PayPal was offered and fully one third of all PayPal mobile customers surveyed said they will abandon a purchase if PayPal is not offered as a checkout option. This loyalty combined with our ability to offer experiences that drive checkout conversion rates of 89% is a truly differentiated value proposition for merchants around the world. To further extend the value we deliver our merchant customers, we recently announced several new merchant products, including a brand new checkout experience with an exciting new tool called Smart Payment Buttons. This new feature enables merchants to create personalized checkout experiences for their customers by dynamically presenting the most relevant payment methods at checkout. In addition to being the only checkout solution to offer support for Pay with Venmo and PayPal Credit, the new PayPal checkout also includes the ability to enable local wallets and funding sources without additional integration work. As part of PayPal checkout, we are also leveraging the power of One Touch to help merchants increase their customer acquisition efforts by reducing friction in their registration process. When a customer was opting One Touch is creating or updating their user account with a merchant they can now choose to leverage their personal data securely stored within One Touch in order to auto populate most of the required account information. Not only does this greatly simplify the registration process, but it also secures a funding source for their new account with the merchant enabling the consumer to start shopping immediately. One Touch is the fastest adopted product in our history and it's now crossed 100 million consumers with 102 million consumers opted in and 9.5 million merchants offering One Touch. 84% of the IR100 now offer One Touch and the same ComScore survey I referenced earlier reveals that 55% of PayPal customers say they made more online purchases because of One Touch. These are game changing results for a product that was introduced only a few years ago and you can see that impact clearly in our mobile results. Our mobile growth in Q2 was 49% with almost 54 billion of mobile volume processed in the quarter. Mobile checkout now represents 39% of our total payment volume. And it's important to remember that the power of our two sided network combined with our revamp text app enables PayPal to provide all of these new experiences to our merchant customers without them needing to do any costly or inconvenient integration work. Not only do these products and partnerships strengthen our proposition to merchants but they also further our mission to give our consumers more choice and flexibility in how they manage and move their money. A clear example of this is our recently launched Venmo card. Developed in partnership with MasterCard the card lets Venmo customers use their balance to pay everywhere MasterCard is accepted in the United States both online and in store and the card can be used to withdraw funds from an ATM. This offers Venmo customers more flexibility in where and how they want to pay and will give merchants more access to the coveted millennial segment. We are quite pleased with the surge of initial demand for the Venmo card and it's another great indicator of the tremendous brand affinity that the millennial generation feels towards Venmo. We continue to make good progress with our Pay with Venmo service. In the quarter, we added Uber and UberEATS to the list of major brands offering distinct Venmo buttons to their customers. We have also seen considerable growth in our service that gives customers a faster way to transfer funds to their bank account for a small fee. Since launch 17% of Venmo users have engaged in a monetized experience. In the quarter, Venmo continued its impressive growth by processing $14.2 billion in payment volume, an increase of 78% year-over-year. And Venmo net new actives hit another all-time record high in Q2, as its network effect and value proposition continue to strongly resonate. I would now like to turn to capital allocation. We laid out our general thoughts around capital allocation at our Investor Day in May including returning cash to shareholders, acquisitions and investing organically in our company. The addition of almost $7 billion of capital from the close of the Synchrony transaction provides us with both enhanced strategic flexibility and the opportunity to further increase the momentum in our consumer and merchant credit offerings. In the quarter, we announced 4 acquisitions and several strategic investments. Each of these acquisitions is strategically focused around platform capabilities that will advance our merchant value proposition and geographic reach. Between our acquisitions and the continuing drumbeat of new products and services being introduced by our product and engineering teams, we have catapulted into a leading digital payments platform for our merchant, technology and financial institution partners around the world. In May, we announced our intention to acquire iZettle, a leading small business on the e commerce platform in Europe and Latin America. This acquisition which is expected to close in late Q3 will significantly expand our international and in-store presence and is strategically aligned with our desire to be a one stop full service solutions provider. We share a common mission with iZettle and together we are committed to helping millions small businesses around the world grow and thrive in an increasingly global and competitive omni channel retail environment. In May we announced the acquisition of Jetlore an AI powered prediction platform which is used by the world's top retailers including Uniqlo and Nordstrom. With Jetlore's talented team and their AI powered technology, we plan to enhance and accelerate PayPal Marketing Solutions, adding new capabilities that will continue to expand our value proposition for merchants beyond the online checkout experience. This is an important area for us, as we increasingly become a full commerce solution for merchants focused on helping them grow their sales in a mobile first digital commerce world. In June, we announced our intention to acquire Hyperwallet and earlier this month we closed the acquisition of Simility, building on our integrated payment solutions for fast growing e-commerce platforms and marketplaces. Hyperwallet is a leading global payouts platform that enables localized multicurrency payment distribution in more than 200 countries and territories. Combining Hyperwallet's powerful payout solution with PayPal's scale and platform capabilities will bring increasing value to our customers particularly in the growing sharing economy. It immediately positions us as a leader in this increasingly important payments category. Simility helps companies prevent fraud and manage risk in real time through advanced machine learning, big data analytics and data visualization capabilities.  While PayPal already provides leading edge fraud management to our merchants, this acquisition will provide PayPal merchants the ability to more actively manage and control their fraud exposure. We believe this will naturally lead to increased sales volumes for our merchants. Additionally we announced our participation in a $125 million round of investment in Pine Labs, one of India's leading point-of-sale solutions providers. Pine Labs offers POS devices that accept credit and debit cards, mobile wallets and services that run on India's unified payments interface, which is a government backed system that allows for instant bank to bank transfers. This investment comes on the heels of PayPal launching our domestic operations in India and will further our focus in one of the most important markets in the world. And finally, last week we announced a strategic investment in PPRO. This investment combined with a comprehensive commercial agreement provides us with the ability to extend over 100 alternate payment methods to our merchant and marketplace customers. The combination of these acquisitions and investments significantly enhances the breadth of services we can offer to consumers, merchants and online marketplaces. PayPal is committed to being a comprehensive digital payments platform, offering complete solutions to our customers, as the world rapidly digitizes across both retail and financial services. This was truly a remarkable quarter for us with teams across the globe delivering meaningful results and intensifying our focus on our customers. We successfully completed our transaction with Synchrony to free up cash for strategic and high value opportunities. We brought innovative and differentiated products and services to our customers. We expanded our relationships with key strategic partners; and we continue discussions with many others around the world. I'd like to thank the PayPal team for their tremendous commitment to our customers and shareholders. And with that I'll now turn the call to John. John Rainey : Thanks Dan. The second quarter was another good quarter for PayPal. We delivered strong results financially and operationally demonstrating our continued momentum and the scalability of our model. As Dan just highlighted we announced four acquisitions during the quarter, strengthening our two sided platform and further solidifying our position as a leading open digital platform for payments globally. At our Investor Day in May we laid out our longer term strategic vision raised our medium term guidance and outlined our capital allocation priorities. And in the quarter, we returned $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, earlier this month, we announced the closing of our sale of consumer credit receivables to Synchrony for approximately $6.9 billion in total consideration. With the completion of this transaction PayPal and Synchrony have extended their existing co brand consumer credit card program and Synchrony is now the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the U.S. through 2028. The interim accounting reclassification of the credit portfolio to held for sale from held for investment affected the presentation of our results in the quarter. These changes in addition to the cost to transition the portfolio reduced comparability to prior periods. Where relevant to the discussion I'll provide normalized results to adjust for these changes Now for our financial performance in the second quarter. Our total payment volume was $139 billion up 27% on a currency neutral basis. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $123 billion. Volume associated with eBay grew 6% on a currency neutral basis to $17 billion. eBay related volumes represented less than 12% of total payment volume for the quarter versus more than 14% in Q2 2017. P2P volume which is a component of merchant services and includes volumes across core PayPal Venmo and Xoom grew 50% to $33 billion and represented approximately 24% of total payment volume versus 21% in Q2 2017. In the second quarter, we added 7.7 million net new active accounts. We ended the quarter with 244 million active accounts which represents 15% growth over Q2 last year. This is the third consecutive quarter of 15% growth in active accounts. On the consumer side active account growth was predominantly driven by core PayPal and Venmo. We also added more than 600000 merchants to our platform ending the quarter with more than 19.5 million merchants. The number of payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12 month basis reached 35.7 with 8.7 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. In the second quarter transactions grew 28% to 2.3 billion. Revenue in the quarter increased 23% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis to $3.86 billion. Transaction revenue grew 20% on a spot basis from strength in core PayPal and Braintree. Revenue from other value added services grew 49% driven by the acquisition of Swift and from held for sale accounting. Revenue also benefited from foreign exchange. Overall, our total revenue increased $52 million from a weaker U.S. dollar with $75 million of translation benefits partially offset by $23 million of hedging losses. This $23 million hedge loss compares to a $19 million hedge gains last year. For Q2, our transaction take rate was 2.38% a decline of 19 basis points from the second quarter of 2017. And our total take rate was 2.77%, down 14 basis points year-over-year. More than 70% of the decline in total take rate is related to the growth in our P2P payment volumes and the $42 million headwind from hedging losses relative to last year. Volume based expenses grew 24% in Q2 to $1.7 billion. Transaction expense was $1.4 billion and represented 98 basis points of TPV, a 1 basis point improvement over Q2 last year. Lower funding costs from growth in P2P as well as the effect of foreign exchange more than offset funding mix pressure in growth in Braintree. Transaction loss in the quarter was $262 million or 19 basis points of TPV. Loan losses were $72 million or five basis points as a rate of TPV down more than 40% from Q2 2017 as a result of held for sale accounting. For modeling purposes, we continue to expect loan losses to be in the range of five basis points as a rate of TPV for 2018. Transaction margin dollars grew 23% to $2.2 billion adjusted for held for sale accounting transaction margin dollars were $2 billion representing 14% growth versus last year. For the quarter transaction margin as a rate was 56%. Again, adjusting for held for sale accounting transaction margin was 53%. Non-transaction related expenses grew 21% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. Normalizing for the Synchrony transaction these expenses would have grown approximately 10% resulting in 345 basis points of operating leverage. Further adjusting for acquisitions, we would've seen non-transaction related expenses grow only 7% for the quarter or $0.125 for every incremental dollar of revenue. Relative to our recent trend, we experienced higher growth in G&A expenses in the second quarter. These expenses increased 33% or $73 million. The primary drivers of this increase were costs associated with our acquisitions and cost associated with the transition of the credit portfolio to Synchrony. In addition, we continue to see strong scalability in our customer support and operations organization. In the second quarter, we experienced a record low customer contact rate. As a result customer support and operations expenses as a percentage of revenue leveraged 135 basis points in Q2 in comparison to the same period last year. In the second quarter, operating income grew 24% to $820 million on 23% top line growth. This resulted in an operating margin of 21.3%. Adjusting for the sale of the Synchrony and acquisitions, operating income grew 22% to $804 million. We continue to balance delivering operating margin expansion with reinvesting back into the business to further strengthen our platform and competitive positioning. In the second quarter, other non-operating income increased $20 million year-over-year to $37 million. This increase was due primarily to an unrealized gain we recognized on an equity investment which was offset by net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was flat to Q2 last year. And on a diluted basis, our weighted average share count was down 1% in the second quarter versus Q2 2017 as a result of share repurchases. Solid top line growth, in conjunction with operating discipline resulted in 28% growth in non-GAAP EPS to $0.58. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.3 billion and short term borrowings of $2 billion. Our cash balance does not include the proceeds from our Synchrony transaction, as it closed on July 2. On a reported basis, our free cash flow was negative $170 million. Net new loans, included in cash flow from operations as a result of held for sale accounting reduced our free cash flow by $907 million. However, on a normalized basis, adjusting for this accounting designation, our free cash flow in the second quarter was $737 million. This equates to approximately $0.19 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Second quarter free cash flow also included a $161 million increase in cash taxes versus last year, primarily related to our first annual U.S. transition tax payment of $125 million. During the quarter we returned $500 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases, and year-to-date, we have completed $2.3 billion of buybacks. We are pleased with the results of our previously announced capital allocation policy. It has so far achieved our goal of balancing organic and inorganic growth investments with the return of a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. Since separation in July 2015, we have announced $4.5 billion in acquisitions; and since our first repurchase authorization in early 2016, we have executed $4.3 billion in share repurchases. In May, at our Investor Day, we updated our guidance related to capital allocation and our plans for the next three to five years. On average, we are targeting $1 billion to $3 billion of M&A per year and returning 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders over that period. We are also committed to optimizing our capital structure, while maintaining an investment grade rating, balancing inorganic and organic investing with margin expansion and continuing our strategy to diversify funding sources for our credit business to reduce capital intensity. In support of the capital allocation framework that we articulated at Investor Day, today we are also announcing a new $10 billion share repurchase authorization. This new authorization further reinforces our ongoing commitment to capital return and disciplined capital allocation to support shareholder value creation. Given the evolving and highly competitive payments landscape maintaining flexibility as it relates to our balance sheet is a priority. Even with the capital allocation framework we have outlined, our cash position and borrowing capacity will allow us to move aggressively where we see opportunities to bolster our position as a leading open digital payments platform. It is also worth noting that meeting our customers' requirements to access their cash while meeting our commitments to global regulators are important aspects of our cash management activities. Our cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our business but also to support these regulatory requirements. As such not all of our corporate cash is available for general corporate purposes. At our Investor Day, we also provided an updated 3 to 5 year outlook to reflect the acceleration of our financial performance. This raised guidance incorporates our capital allocation priorities among acquisitions, share repurchase and capital expenditures. Importantly, it also contemplates the Synchrony transaction as well as the evolution of our relationship with eBay following the expiration of the operating agreement. We raised our outlook on currency neutral compound annual revenue growth to 17% to 18% from 16% to 17% reflecting the strength of our business. While we did not explicitly guide payment volume growth, we expect it to remain in the range of our previous guidance of mid 20% growth. In addition we indicated that we expect to realize operating margin expansion each year at approximately 20% compound annual growth and non-GAAP EPS. Before I discuss our guidance for the remainder of 2018 I would like to discuss the impacts we expect in 2019 from our recently announced acquisitions. We currently anticipate $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS dilution on a non-GAAP basis from these transactions and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings in 2020. We plan to provide additional commentary on our expectations for 2019 when we report Q3. I'd now like to discuss our updated guidance for the full year as well as our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. Our strong performance in the first half of 2018 has resulted in 23% revenue growth and 29% non-GAAP EPS growth. Incorporating both our performance year-to-date as well as our expectations for the back half of 2018 we are raising our full year 2018 revenue guidance to be in the range of $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion and raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.35. At the midpoint of our range is this represents 18% revenue growth and 23% earnings growth. Excluding the revenue impact from the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables top-line growth at the midpoint of our range will be 21% on a currency neutral basis. We are pleased to be providing this outlook today. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance on meaningful momentum while absorbing the foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar and near-term earnings dilution from our acquisitions. Relative to our expectations when we last provided guidance, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus our main international currencies by approximately 5%. At current exchange rates revenue is negatively impacted by approximately $80 million in the back half of the year. Our earnings for the full year are largely protected from currency movements but revenue will continue to be partially exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen. In addition, as it relates to our earnings for the full year we expect the iZettle acquisition to close late in the third quarter and the Hyperwallet acquisition to close in the fourth quarter. We expect non-GAAP EPS dilution for 2018 to be approximately $0.02 from the combined impact of our acquisitions this year. For the year, we are raising revenue by $100 million. This raise includes approximately $100 million of incremental revenue from momentum approximately $50 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions and our out-performance in Q2 partially offset by approximately $80 million of FX headwinds. On EPS for the year we have raised our outlook by $0.01. Again this raise is meaningful given our expectation of $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions. Offsetting the dilutive effect from our acquisitions is our out-performance in the second quarter in addition to a $0.01 raise on momentum. For the third quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion. We expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. In Q3 at the midpoint of our ranges we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 500 basis points ahead of revenue growth and more than 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. In summary we continue to make progress against our key strategic initiatives and we have good momentum across our business heading into the back half of the year. I would like to thank our customers and partners as well as our global team for delivering a strong quarter. With that I'll hand it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. James Fossett : Thanks very much. I wanted to just ask quickly about the engagement and certainly impressive statistics there. But wondering if you're doing anything specifically to drive that engagement or how you can continue to move that forward. And I guess is a follow up one place where we noticed that things were varied versus our model is that the year-over-year decline in tax rate seems to -- or take rate excuse me seems to have picked up pace again in the first half of the year. Can you breakout kind of what the key drivers are in take rate right now, and what our expectations should be going forward? Thank you. Dan Schulman : So John will take that take rate James and I'll take the engagement question. I'll start off with that given the order of your questions. So first of all our net new actives and engagement we're obviously pleased with both the growth of engagement. Q2 is a seasonally low quarter for us and we did 7.7 million net new actives 16 million in H1. And we're on track to do over 30 million in 2018 which is above our 2017 full year results. And as you know, that was by far in a way our best year by a long shot. So to your point, specifically though engagement actually accelerated to 9%. It had been growing by about 8% for the previous two or three quarters and it went up to 9% and to almost now three times a month. And our view on that is we expect that to continue. We've got a number of tailwinds around engagement. First of all, I think our customer experiences are better than they've ever been before. You look at One Touch, its conversion rate at -- as you saw from some of those ComScore studies and the surveys that have been done, people want to use the service more. As a result of that, we've done a tremendous amount of enhancements around P2P. Choice is leading to more engagement. We've got a new app, and we have a whole new suite of services. The Venmo card is going to lead to more engagement. We have the PayPal Cash Card, that's going to lead to more engagement. And so I think - and then of course, we've got rewards coming on in the later part of this year with some of our key financial institution partners. And so I think we're going to continue to see engagement grow at a nice clip going forward. And I think it bodes well obviously to have both more customers coming on than ever before, using this service more than they ever have. And if you look at new cohorts versus older cohorts, our new cohorts are more engaged than our older cohorts. Most of the time, you'd expect as you grow your net new actives, you get more and more that maybe the quality of those net new actives aren't the same as what they were before. It's actually the opposite here. The new net new actives are more engaged than our previous cohorts, which by the way means, we have a potential opportunity to educate our older customers on all the new services that we have as well. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about both net new actives and engagement. I'll turn it over to John to talk about take rate. John Rainey : Sure. It's good to speak with you James. If you look at the composition of the decline in our take rate, just take our total take rate of 2.77% for the quarter, the 14 basis points decline, approximately 70% of that was due to two things. First is P2P. The growth in P2P, which has been a familiar story for several quarters right now. But maybe more pronounced this quarter the second thing was the year-over-year swing in hedges. That's a $42 million delta year-over-year. So that accounts for that. So I believe those were about 10 basis points of the 14 basis point decline. Beyond that, it's just the normal changes related to mix in our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Great. Thanks guys and congrats on another strong quarter. Dan, just again as you think about the competitive environment now with some newer participants going public and the like, can you maybe talk a little bit about differentiating the PayPal value proposition? And just maybe more specifically is the big differentiator really the conversion rate of the PayPal Wallet and your ability to sort of deliver that seamlessly with Venmo sort of, one integration if you will into the merchant base? Dan Schulman : Yes. First off thanks for the question, George. So I think a couple of things on competition. First of all, obviously, we respect all of our competitors. We learn from them but we are really focused on our customers and what their needs are. And that's what we pay a tremendous amount of attention to and we feel that we can solve their pain points better than anybody else. We'll continue to win and be a leading platform in the digital payment space. Secondly I'd say it's obviously not a zero sum game. Yes, we're operating in what we think is $100 trillion total addressable market which is rapidly digitizing as online and off line is blurring. And we have a very small share of that total TAM. So it's very early innings. And that's why we said at our Investor Day that we think our greatest potential lies ahead. In terms of differentiation from the competitive set I think we have quite a number of different things that we've done. First of all with the advent of choice and becoming an open platform it did redefine the competitive landscape. We are now working with financial institutions networks and technology companies as partners. I mean, before it was much more characterized as frenemies [ph] people were - many people question whether these allies of us now we're going to move into the payment space. And really they're taking the best of our digital platform the best of their assets and we're working together to create unique value propositions that neither of us could do alone. So in many ways a lot of the competitive intensity is more benign than it was several years ago. But again there is much more it than that because this is all we do. This is - we are a digital payments platform. We control the full end to end value proposition which is unlike many of our competitors. We actually are trying to redefine the game. Many of the players in the space when they come to customers come with point solutions or point products. And we are coming with an overall solution set that goes beyond just either checkout or helping customers now to grow their sales and we're really trying to provide a differentiated not a commoditized service for our customers. When you look at a scale that we have and the network effect and the loyalty to this sort of two sided platform it's very, very different than a lot of our competitors. A lot of our competitors offer one side of that network or try to offer the other side. Only we can offer this two sided platform. And if you remember from that ComScore study having a consumer base that one-third of the mobile customers that were surveyed would abandon a purchase if it didn't have PayPal. That's an incredibly compelling thing for our merchant partners to want to always have a branded PayPal presence on their platform. And honestly our products and our services they just perform better. I mean you mentioned conversion rate and I think that is one of the biggest things advantages that we have. Almost two times that of a general marketplace in terms of conversion at 89% and so I think there are a host of differentiated features that we have. But I don't if you want to add to any of this. But we feel pretty good about our competitive position. And honestly with all the acquisitions that we've just done the new products we're putting into the market that actually - our differentiation is expanding as we look forward. Anything you'd want to add to that? John Rainey : No. You covered it well. The point Dan was making about the breadth of the platform. I think that is most enhanced by the two sided nature of what we do and our ability to control the experience end to end. So that conversion rate that Dan was alluding to at the end of the day when customers are being payment today they're looking more toward how do you help acquire a customer versus how you give better access to sort of legacy dial tone or point of sale solutions. That two sided platform is what allows us to deliver that conversion rate. It's nearly double what you see from everything else out there and that that is extraordinarily difficult to replicate. Many have tried it is very difficult to do and I think we are quite distinct in that regard that stands out as one of our biggest differentiators as a key part of all those elements of our platform as we compare those up against others. And it\u2019s a big part why we're just taking market share tremendously. Dan Schulman : I mean, I think the whole thing we're trying to do is to be the sort of operating system for digital commerce. If you think about merchants that are creating now apps to add value add to their customers one of the biggest issues they run into is friction in terms of getting people to sign up for those apps. One of the things I talk about in my remarks is the ability for us when a customer opts in to seamlessly populate a merchant app and then not just populate with customer experience information but with the funding instrument so immediately that customer can shop. Those little types of things are incredibly valuable for merchant partners in general. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you. Dan, I guess one thing on the decision to allocate as much as you have to share buybacks. Given the track record that you've got generally with your acquisitions is that reflective of the opportunity set that you see out there in potential acquisitions in the - post the four that you've done? What's the right way to read the tradeoff there particularly given the kind of growth acceleration you have been able to get out of some of the acquisitions that you made in the past? And then I guess just one area I want to make sure that we understand the right way the deceleration in growth in - particularly on the TPV side that we saw in the international business on an FX neutral basis any real distinction that you'd want to call out for the gap between that and the acceleration that you saw in the U.S? Dan Schulman : Yeah. I'll start with the first one and then John will talk about the second one. So we're just trying to be consistent with the medium term guidance that we gave in -- at our Investor Day. We said we were going to return somewhere around 40% to 50% of our free cash flow over the next three to five years which was our medium-term guidance. In order to assure shareholders that that would be the case the board authorized a $10 billion share buyback and so that's just consistent with that. We firmly believe that there are a lot of opportunities for us to continue to acquire best in class capabilities to acquire positions in different geographies around the world through either investments or acquisitions. And as we said at the Investor Day, we are targeting $1 billion to $3 billion a year to go and do that. Now we look at hundreds of different opportunities every single quarter. And also remember that obviously our internal innovation is accelerating. I think Bill and his team have done an incredible job over the last several years in just transforming, how much product we can put out into the marketplace. Our partnerships are allowing us to do things that we might have had to acquire before or develop internally like a rewards program. Now that will happen in partnership with the financial institutions who are now our partners. But there are always capabilities out there like a Hyperwallet or an iZettle where it would take us either a lot of time or a lot of resource to develop. They are solely focused on that capability as a best in class and a good customer list and a modern platform to go and do that. And where we see that we're going to obviously be disciplined and I would think about it financially, but we will continue to be quiet acquisitive going forward. We do think we have a chance both on the merchant side from a platform perspective, but also from the consumer side as we look to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move their money that there are opportunities for us to continue to be acquisitive. And we're not ruling out the ability for us to do a larger acquisition if that comes around. But we're going to be much more - have a lot more scrutiny around that kind of thing. Larger acquisitions are inherently more risky and they prevent us from doing other things. So we're not ruling that out. But in our guidance that we've done in our medium-term outlook, there's that cash return to shareholders that $1 billion to $3 billion a year on average that we'll do an acquisition, so no change really from Investor Day. John Rainey : Heath, this is John. As it pertains to what we're seeing internationally as it relates to TPV and revenue, there's two things maybe to call out. But the first is that anytime that - and this is what I'm about to say is very consistent with what we've seen historically. But when there are sharp changes in currencies not only is there going to be an effect on the translation of those revenues into our financial statements, but we see the effect on consumer behavior as well. And so there is \u2013 you are seeing a little bit of that with the movements in currency. There's also -- we see a little bit of weakness on the eBay part of the business. But I'll tell you that the fact that we are raising our guidance for the year despite that is I think a strong indication of the diversification of our portfolio the fact that we are much less reliant on them than we have been historically and we expect that trend to continue. So pretty excited about the trends in the business notwithstanding those couple of issues. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Dan Schulman : Hi, Darrin. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Hey, guys. Thanks. Listen, you're trending at around 22% currently at constant currency on revenues. But if we were to add that to seven points of annualized from Synchrony in the second half it still implies a bit of a decel [ph] a couple of hundred bps for the second half of the year. And I guess a just wanted to hear if there's anything specific on that or it's just conservatism. And then just a quick follow up for I guess either Dan or Bill, and it really has to do with monetization of Venmo which looks like you guys are calling out just so many more opportunities than just Pay with Venmo now with instant deposit and with a card. Can you give us more idea what inning are we on each of those. Because it seems like a bigger opportunity than we initially thought it could be. Dan Schulman : I'll start with revenue and then turn it over to the others. The trends in our business are strong. I want to very clearly call that out as we talked about with a guide about $100 million of our increase is related to momentum. We certainly do see an impact being a multinational company from FX headwinds and that's pretty significant in the back half of the year so that has an impact. And then Darrin there are always things that can affect one quarter to the next. One example is that we're lapping Tio from last year. That was $20 million of revenue for us in the third quarter so not an insignificant amount. And then there are other things that we put in place last year, product changes that we monetized that we're lapping. So there are a couple of comps from one period to the next. But the trends in our business are still very strong and we're actually quite excited as we get ready to step up into 2019. Bill Ready : Yes. And on the Venmo monetization side, we're certainly still in the early innings there for sure. We put out a great set of products that we see users really engaging with strongly. As you called out you have Pay with Venmo that is seeing really nice demand from merchants the best merchants and apps out there putting dedicated Venmo. Like Uber and Uber Eats and Grubhub, Eat24, Seamless and many others and we think we'll see a steady drumbeat of those coming on. There is a great pipeline of those adding in dedicated Venmo buttons. In addition to the two million plus merchants that are already accepting Pay with Venmo via PayPal, Instant Cash Out has seen really great pick up. The Venmo card as Dan remarked earlier on has seen really, really strong interest from our customer base. And so we see a real composite of those things like smart buttons that will allow more people easily have a dedicated Venmo buy button. We think there's a lot left in front of us there. It will be a multiyear journey. We're relieved following the path PayPal, PayPal started it out as P2P only. It was a multiyear journey as PayPal then became a broad merchant services platform with a broad set of commerce. But we see Venmo trending along nicely, really positive response of 17% of users engaging in a monetized experience so far this year. And that's what's getting these products out to market. And so we think we're very much in the early innings. There's a lot left ahead of us. And to be clear, it's a multiyear journey. We think these things will play over multiple years, but were off to a great start. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thanks for taking my question. With the announcement by the U.K. payment system regulator this week that they're reviewing merchant acquiring practices in the UK, could you comment on whether you expect to be included or exempt from that? And clearly you have a unique two sided payment platform, but I'd be curious on your thoughts. Dan Schulman : Bill you want to take that? Bill Ready : Yes. I think I would just say it's evolving we're watching it closely, too early to comment on that. But we work closely with regulators. And generally, we have been a great partner to the ecosystem delivering a lot of value to our customers. And so any of these kinds of regulatory movements we're hand in hand with the regulators on those things, still playing out too early to comment. But we think that there's not a particular exposure that we will call out at this time. David Togut : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we do have time from one last question and that is coming from Tien-tsin with JPMorgan. Tien-tsin: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask maybe for Bill just the new PayPal checkout smartbuttons I mean it feels like a pretty big enhancement especially overseas. I know you had a question on international earlier. How would you rank the importance of this upgrade in relation to enhancements like say One Touch? I mean, how can we gauge success? And just as my follow-up I'll ask it together on Venmo monetization. Could we see a step up in your marketing budget or a spend going to the holidays on both the cards and the commoners opportunity around Venmo? Thanks. Bill Ready : So I'll start with Venmo and come back with smart buttons. The really interesting thing on Venmo is that there's always been such great rally and just inherent interest from consumers on it that we historically have seen very little marketing cult dollars to get to the growth that we have. We just had our biggest quarter over ever of new users on Venmo and great growth of $14 billion and volume up 78% year-on-year. And we're basically spending next to nothing on marketing because our users to our marketing for us. Really Venmo users tell other users about the product and platform. And so that has allowed us to really not have to spend a lot on marketing. Certainly though as we see good traction with these things we will absolutely think about how we can augment that. But it's a great win. You don't have to artificially complete demand. There's a really strong demand for customers organically and then we can augment that as we need to, but we really has fantastic organic demand without us having to go do much of marketing. Dan Schulman : Some of our partners will go marketing around it because they're excited about it. Bill Ready : That's exactly right. And then on smart payment buttons as we've talked about before our ability to go distribute new experiences to merchants without merchants having to do work is a key structural advantage that we have versus legacy payment platforms. And it's why we're able to deliver a greater conversion and rollout products like One Touch to 9.5 million plus merchants in 200 markets without them doing work. Smart payment buttons is an advanced to that. So we see that this really quite important at the fact that it's got a handle not only our own payment method like PayPal, PayPal Credit, Venmo dynamically presenting those when they are most relevant so that merchants don't have to worry about the confusion of too many buttons at checkout. We are also adding an alternative payment method. And we think it's quite meaningful in that it democratize is access to this long-tail of alternative payments as you go country by country. There\u2019s been some other providers out there that have done that but those have been big heavy enterprise type solution, so it's really only a handful of merchants that can get access to those things. We think we can get that to many millions of merchants which is a game changer in terms of merchants having access to the most relevant payment methods to offer to the consumer at any moment in time. And I think this further distances us from competition in terms of how we deliver better conversion and better customer acquisition, which is really the game that we play quite differently than others where we think of ourselves as in the business of driving conversion of customer acquisition versus much of the legacy payments industry or traditional players are providing access to dial tone access to peace of the payment ecosystem versus we\u2019re driving customer acquisition and smart paying button as a great examples of that. Dan Schulman : Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thanks very much. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Sheri. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings' earnings call for the third quarter 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations; and Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer. We are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2018, our initial outlook for 2019, our medium-term guidance and the impact and timing of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, October 18, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. PayPal had another excellent quarter with $3.68 billion of revenue growing at 14% on both, the spot and currency neutral basis. Normalizing through the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony revenues grew at 21%. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 21.4% grew 142 basis points from last year, and we delivered $0.58 of non-GAAP EPS, up 26% year-over-year. In short, we continue to drive strong financial performance. As pleased as I am with our financials, the highlight of the quarter was our growth in net new actives and engagement. We drove a record 9.1 million net new active accounts surpassing 254 million customer accounts by the end of the quarter. We added 34 million net new actives to our platform in the past 12 months, averaging almost 3 million net new customers per month. During the quarter we drove 2.5 billion transactions growing 27%. Our engagement per active user increased 9.5% to 36.5x per year. A major driver of engagement is the use of mobile devices across our platform. Predominantly driven by our market leading checkout conversion rates with One Touch. One Touch continues to expand with 112 million consumers and 10.4 million merchants using One Touch. In Q3, we saw mobile growth of 45% with approximately 57 billion of mobile volume processed in the quarter. Mobile checkout now represents 40% of our total payment volume. Customer choice also continues to yield a meaningful lift in our engagement metrics. Today, nearly all of our customers have choice available to them, and more than 55 million PayPal customers have actively used choice in some 200 markets. Another very important outcome of choice was that it enabled PayPal to develop deep partnerships throughout our ecosystem. In just over two years we've signed over 35 partnerships with some of the world's largest and most influential brands in finance, in technology and commerce. Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we've signed a multi-faceted partnership agreement with American Express. As one of the leading brands in the world it always made sense that PayPal and American Express would become strategic partners. Steve Squeri and his team have been great to work with, and I'm very pleased with the comprehensive nature of our partnership going forward. Over the next several quarters PayPal will have enhanced access to American Express as a payment option in our wallet. The agreement will allow PayPal to access American Express tokens and enables a deep integration of our Venmo and PayPal P2P capabilities within the Amex platform. Additionally, PayPal and American Express consumers will be able to use their American Express reward points to pay for their purchases at millions of PayPal merchants around the world. Over the next year we will rollout these capabilities to our mutual customers and we are pleased to begin what will be an important relationship for both companies. With this agreement we now have strategic relationships in place with all of the major card networks, not only have these partnerships redefined our competitive landscape, they have also created new and unique commerce experiences for our mutual customers around the world. Most of you on the call know that we also recently announced a significant and growing partnership with Walmart. Working together, Walmart and PayPal have developed innovative new product experiences to create a more affordable and convenient way for the unbanked segment of customers to more efficiently manage and move their money; and as a result, empowering more people to gain access to the digital economy. As part of this deep collaboration, PayPal money services will be available at all Walmart locations in the U.S. beginning in November. Using the PayPal mobile app customers can easily load cash into their PayPal balance, and for the first time customers can withdraw money from their PayPal balance at Walmart retail stores and Walmart money centers across the country. Additionally, customers can use the PayPal cash master card to shop in store on mobile and online at Walmart, as well as withdraw cash at the register or from Walmart's ATM locations nationwide. And this is just the beginning, we are currently working hand-in-hand with the Walmart team to introduce even more capabilities in the future. Walmart and PayPal share the belief that managing and moving money should be affordable, accessible, efficient and secure for all segments of our population. And while digital and mobile commerce continues to grow at remarkable rates, there are tens of millions of people that still do not have access to the benefits of the digital economy. This partnership which leverages and combines the unique strengths of both our companies is aimed at addressing that issue. We also continue to grow our partnerships around the globe. For instance, we are pleased to announce that we have finalized a strategic partnership with Ita\u00fa Unibanco, one of the largest banks in Brazil. With this agreement we add another major issuing partner in Latin America to help drive digital spend and improve convenience for our joint customers. We continue to work closely with our large merchant partners. We recently struck a comprehensive strategic agreement with Chevron to improve the payment experience at it's gas stations in the U.S. Together we plan to launch a new mobile payment app in early 2019 that will reduce the amount of time that a customer spends at the pump. This is yet another example of how we are using PayPal's extensive platform capabilities to help our partners create differentiated customer experiences. Chevron joins the list of our existing partnerships in this industry including Shell, B.P. and Exxon Mobil. In addition to all the progress we've made in forging new partnerships, this was an extremely busy period for our product development teams as we brought several new products to market and we saw significant advances across a wide array of Venmo monetization efforts. I'm especially pleased with the strong overall momentum surrounding Venmo. For the third quarter in a row Venmo posted yet again another record for net new actives. This is driving accelerating network effects as volume groups 78% to $16.7 billion with an annualized run rate now approaching $70 billion. And while it is still early, our monetization efforts appear to be reaching a tipping point. 24% of Venmo users have now participated in a monetizable action; this is up from 17% one quarter ago and 13% in May of this year. Pay with Venmo monthly active users increased approximately 185% month-over-month in September versus August. And across the Uber and Uber Eats apps, we saw more than 300% month-over-month volume growth in September versus August. Our Venmo cart is also off to a strong start with approximately 320% month-over-month growth in monthly active users from August to September. Notably, the two top purchase category since launch for our card are supermarkets and restaurants. These daily used cases demonstrate that we are rapidly gaining omnichannel ubiquity and becoming a part of our Venmo customers every day spend. Finally, last month alone we processed over $1 billion in instant transfer volume on the Venmo platform alone. In summary, I couldn't be more pleased with the customer adoption across our Venmo initiatives. This quarter we addressed one of the biggest issues facing small businesses; the amount of time it takes for them to access cash from their sales. The launch of Funds Now gives PayPal merchants, who are in good standing, access to their sales within minutes at no extra cost by eliminating holds, delays and reserves; we are providing our merchants immediate access to the funds they need to invest back into their business, pay their bills, and service their customers. We aspire to set a new standard in payments that immediate access to fund should be the norm rather than the exception for small businesses in good standing. We are pleased to say that over 1 million merchants across the globe are already taking advantage of Funds Now. Another way we are helping merchants to expand their sales opportunities is through the rollout of PayPal checkout with smart payment buttons. The new PayPal checkout improves the purchase experience by dynamically presenting the most relevant payment methods to each shopper, including PayPal, PayPal credit, Venmo in a wide range of alternative payment methods around the world. This means businesses don't need to clutter their checkout pages, and shoppers see the options they would be most likely to use which is proven to increase conversion for our merchant customers; and we're currently deploying this innovative checkout experience globally. A little more than a year ago we acquired Swift Financial to bolster the financing options for small and mid-sized businesses. Our PayPal business financing solutions which includes PayPal working capital and PayPal business loans provided our customers more than $1 billion in funding last quarter. This more than doubles the $480 million in funding in the same period last year. We believe we are now one of the Top 5 providers of working capital to small businesses in the U.S. We will continue to leverage acquisitions to strengthen our two-sided platform and maintain our position as the leading global open platform for digital payments. Last month we closed our acquisition of iZettle, strengthening our global platform capabilities and in-store presence. We believe this acquisition provides significant value for our small business merchants as we expand our point-of-sale capabilities globally. We expect to close the acquisition of Hyperwallet this quarter and we're excited to extend it's enhanced global payout capabilities to our marketplace customers. Before I turn the call over to John for more details on our financial results, I want to say how proud I am of the PayPal team and their efforts to provide ever increasing value for our customers. As proof of that, Interbrand recently announced that PayPal had increased it's brand value by 22% in the last year, making us one of the Top 6 fastest growing brands in the world. These kinds of results are what create sustainable and long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. PayPal had another solid quarter in Q3, both, financially and operationally. Our targeted growth strategies and investments to strengthen both, the merchant and consumer sides of our platform continue to drive strong financial results. Our consistent growth in active accounts, payment volume, engagement in revenue demonstrates the power and resiliency of our business. In addition, our growth in operating income while at the same time delivering operating margin expansion highlights the scalability of our model. In the third quarter, we not only expanded our operating margin but also reinvested to grow users, volume and revenue. Before I go into our financial results, I'd like to provide a few highlights from the quarter. As a reminder, the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony closed in early July. Where relevant, I will provide normalized results for comparability. In addition, our acquisition of iZettle closed in late September. Our Q3 operating metrics and financial results include no impact from this transaction. Revenue grew approximately 21% in Q3 adjusting for the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Operating income grew 22% with 142 basis points of operating margin expansion. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 26%. And on a normalized basis, we generated $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Turning to our financial performance for the quarter; total payment volume was $143 billion, an increase of 24% at spot, and 25% on a currency neutral basis. In comparison to the third quarter of 2017, on a spot basis we experienced more than five points of pressure from the lapping of TIO Networks and as a result of a stronger dollar. U.S. payment volume growth was 27% and international payment volume growth was 22% on a currency neutral basis. Merchant services volume was $127 billion, growing 28% on a currency neutral basis, and volume associated with eBay grew 3%. For the quarter, eBay related volume represented 11% of volume on our platform, down from 20% three years ago. This is a continuation of a multi-year trend and this quarter our merchant services volume grew more than 8x faster than our eBay marketplaces volume. P2P volume which is part of merchant services grew 50% to $36 billion and represented approximately 25% of total payment volume versus 21% last year. We ended the quarter with 254 million active customer accounts adding 9.1 million net new customer accounts. Q3 represents the fourth consecutive quarter with 15% growth in total active accounts demonstrating the success of our customer-centric model and the continued demand for our industry-leading payment solutions. Account growth in the third quarter was driven by core PayPal followed by Venmo. In the third quarter we continue to see strong momentum in engagement on our platform. Payment transactions per active account increased 9.5% to 36.5% versus 33.3% in the third quarter last year. And transactions grew 27% to 2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months we have processed more than 9.2 billion transactions. Revenue in the third quarter increased 14% on both the spot and currency neutral basis to $3.7 billion. However this growth was affected by the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony which had about a 7-point impact. Adjusting for the sale, revenue growth would have been approximately 21% inline with the third quarter last year. On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 17% in the quarter and revenue from other value-added services declined 11%. I'd like to give additional color on the trends in transaction revenue growth. In comparison to Q3 '17 the stronger U.S. dollar, softness in our eBay business, and the lapping of TIO Networks affected our year-over-year revenue comparisons. While the stronger dollar and ongoing pressure on our eBay marketplaces business had an impact on our quarterly results, our diversified portfolio, both from a geographic and a product perspective allowed us to continue to deliver solid revenue growth. The 11% year-over-year decline in revenue from other value-added services was a result of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony. This overall decline was partially offset by solid growth in both our merchant working capital and international consumer credit businesses. For the third quarter, our transaction take rate was 2.34%, a decline of 14 basis points from last year. Approximately two-thirds of the change in transaction take rate was related to growth in P2P, the remainder was related to slower growth in eBay and lower cross-border volume. In Q3 total take rate was 2.58% versus 2.81% in Q3 '17. The sale of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio resulted in a 16 basis point reduction in total take rate; this was the largest single driver of the overall decline and reduces comparability to prior periods. We expect this impact to continue for the next three quarters. Volume based expenses increased 13% in Q3 to $1.7 billion. Transaction expense was $1.4 billion and represented 96 basis points as a rate of TPV which was flat to last year and a 2 basis point improvement sequentially. Transaction loss was $259 million or 18 basis points as a rate of TPV versus 19 basis points in Q3 '17 and Q2 '18. Improvements from both core and Venmo helped to drive these results. Loan loss was $36 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV, down 75% year-over-year, again due to the sale of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Transaction margin dollars grew 14% to $2 billion with a transaction margin rate of 55%. Non-transaction related expenses grew 9% in the third quarter to $1.2 billion. As a percentage of total revenue, these expenses leveraged 130 basis points versus the third quarter last year. Normalizing for acquisitions and cost directly related to the sell for Synchrony, non-transaction related expenses grew approximately 6% year-over-year. Again, this demonstrates our sustainability to scale our platform at a low marginal cost. This performance drove 22% growth in operating income and 142 basis points of operating margin expansion. We continue to balance delivering operating margin expansion with reinvesting back into the business to further strengthen our platform and competitive positioning. Solid topline growth in conjunction with OpEx discipline resulted in 26% growth in non-GAAP EPS to $0.58. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $10.5 billion in short-term borrowings of $2 billion. On a reported basis, our free cash flow was $4.4 billion, adjusting for the Synchrony proceeds our free cash flow in the third quarter was $772 million; this equates to $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Our business delivered strong growth, robust profitability and consistent free cash flow; this enables us to make significant organic and inorganic investments for our future growth while at the same time returning cash to our shareholders. In May, we announced our plans to return approximately 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the next five years. In Q3 we returned $600 million, and year-to-date we have returned nearly $3 billion. I would now like to discuss or updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year, as well as our initial thoughts of 2019. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.195 billion to $4.275 billion or 13% to 15% growth on a currency neutral basis. Normalizing for the U.S. credit receivable sale, the implied revenue growth rate would be 20% to 22% for the fourth quarter. This guidance incorporates approximately $30 million of impact from changes in foreign currency and a later close in Q4 than we previously expected for the Hyperwallet acquisition, as well as anticipated softness in our eBay marketplaces business. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. Our EPS expectations include a higher than normal below the line benefit. We are electing to opportunistically reinvest some of this benefit back into the business which will offset some of the natural leverage we realized from efficiencies of scale. We believe this is the right decision to drive long-term value for PayPal. For full year revenue guidance, we are raising the low-end and maintaining the high-end of our previous range which absorbs the $30 million headwind from U.S. dollar strength and the Hyperwallet timing. We now expect 2018 revenue to be in the range of $15.42 billion to $15.5 billion or 17% to 18% growth on a currency neutral basis. Normalizing for the sale to Synchrony, the implied revenue growth rate would be approximately 21% for the full year. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $2.38 to $2.40. In addition, given the strong free cash flow we have generated all year, as well as the Synchrony proceeds; we now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $4.5 billion. We are still in our planning process for 2019 but I'd like to provide you with an initial framework for how we're thinking about our business next year. We expect revenue to grow approximately 17% on a currency neutral basis. This growth rate reflects the reduction in other value-added services revenue in the first half of 2019 as a result of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Normalizing for this, our expectation is that revenue would be growing in the range of 20% to 21%. In addition, we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 20%. This outlook incorporates our integration plans for the four acquisitions we have announced this year. Normalizing for this, we would expect our EPS to grow approximately 23%. Next year we expect our 2018 acquisitions to contribute approximately 1.5 points of growth to revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 of dilution to earnings per share. And in 2020, we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings. As we reflect on the first three quarters of 2018, we're very encouraged by our performance and the opportunities ahead. Already this year we have announced approximately $2.7 billion in acquisitions, returned approximately $3 billion in cash to shareholders, delivered operating margin expansion and significantly improve the overall growth profile of our business. We are innovating this scale and introducing great payment experiences for our consumers and merchants. The sustained momentum we see in the business gives us confidence to invest in high potential areas such as Venmo, global expansion, in-store strategies, and PayPal business loans. We're extremely pleased with our progress. I want to close by thanking all of PayPal's customers and our colleagues worldwide for making this another strong quarter. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I wanted to ask about eBay; I know they announced the managed payments initiatives and it doesn't look like PayPal is featured as a payment option. So trying to figure out what's the impact to PayPal's model? I mean, I guess what we're trying to get at is figure out how much the weakness in eBay is due to the run rate of core eBay volumes? Were those volumes coming off of PayPal in payments to other providers? Dan Schulman : Thanks Brian, it's Dan. I'll take a crack at that and then turn it over to John and Bill, if they've got anything else to add to it. So first of all, eBay's performance on our platform had nothing to do with intermediated payments. They announced publicly -- I think they had 20 million of TPV that moved to intermediated payments, we don't even see that as a rounding [ph] on our results. So intermediate payments has just started off for them, no impact on their performance on our platform. So let me take a step back and talk to you a little bit about what I see going forward. So I think that PayPal and eBay are going to continue to be close strategic partners for the foreseeable future. And, so why do I say that? I say that because it's not just that we have signed a 5-year term with them to display PayPal branded services on their intermediated payments or that we just signed a while ago a comprehensive 7-year deal to provide eBay shopper's with PayPal credit offers. Those things are just deals that we've done with eBay. The most important thing is that our mutual sellers and merchants demanded the consumers that we have, the sellers that eBay and PayPal share demand to have PayPal; their sales actually depend on it. And we just put out -- Bill, I think just published a market research that was done with IPSOs [ph] that was a comprehensive study, and that study showed what we've been talking about for quite some time. And in the study it said that consumers on average are 54% more willing to buy when a merchant accepts PayPal; and by the way, that's at the low-end of that. If that goes up when it's a cross-border transaction, when it's mobile, when it's unfamiliar brands and if you think about the long tail of eBay merchants; so that 54% is a low number for those. And so you also have 59% of PayPal users who have abandoned [ph] a transaction because PayPal wasn't the checkout option. And so we've got 254 million customers on our platform right now, imagine it's almost 60% of them would abandon a sale because PayPal checkout wasn't available. And so -- and by the way, we've been talking about this for quite some time and if you look at the seller feedback on the eBay seller form and look at what those sellers are saying, those that have moved over to intermediated payments; you'll see comments from them that their sales have dropped 40% to 60% and they're clamoring to come back to PayPal. So both eBay and PayPal want to serve our mutual customers extremely well, it's a major integration for eBay to put PayPal on, we're committed to both of us to having PayPal on intermediated payments beginning next year but we feel really great about the growing value proposition that we have, and we feel great about the partnership that we'll have with eBay going forward as well. Anything you would add, Bill? Bill Ready : I would just add to that that eBay has responded to those comments saying that sellers have issues with the drop in sale, they can revert back to PayPal in the near-term and in the long-term they are working hard to make PayPal available as a payment option, and we're working hand-in-hand with eBay to try and make sure that's available to those customers given the strong demand from customers as Dan was describing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul [ph] with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : I just wanted to follow-up on Venmo, could [ph] you give us some good updates there. Just could you help us think through the contribution -- you mentioned $1 billion instant transfer volume in September; should we think of that as $1 billion monthly run rate? And then, would you say there are any other monetization activities that are starting to scale, just -- just, kind of -- I want to make sure I'm thinking about the contribution correctly. Bill Ready : Sure. The $1 billion in instant transfer volume was for the month of September, and that's been growing nicely, we don't see anything to disturb that trend. And instant transfer is one of the monetization initiatives that we see scaling well, as Dan mentioned in his remarks, pay with Venmo is growing very nicely. Uber, Uber Eats, Grubhub, Eat24, Seamless have all integrated pay with Venmo, that's been growing quite remarkably. I mentioned 185% month-over-month growth on pay with Venmo, and the card is seeing 320% month-over-month growth, those are early but those are the kinds of rapid growth results that we're seeing with other initiatives on Venmo, and so across all three of our major monetization initiatives instant transfer, pay with Venmo and other apps like Uber and Grubhub, and the card, we see all of those starting to really scale in a meaningful way. Dan Schulman : And you also saw the number of Venmo customers who have now been in a monetizable act go to 24% up from 17% just one quarter ago. So as I mentioned in my remarks, it's still or late [ph] obviously but it looks like we've achieved some kind of tipping point right now, and I think both Bill and I are extremely pleased with the results of Venmo. One other thing that I would just point out is, as I mentioned, it seems repetitive but we don't take it for granted; for three quarters in a row right now we've each quarter seen record net new active signing up to Venmo. So not only are you seeing Venmo expand quite rapidly but the percent of people using the monetizable event is going up quite rapidly as well. So you combine all of those things together, you can see why we're quite pleased with the momentum as of now. Operator : Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Just wanted to ask John, as we look at the initial guide for '19, how are you thinking about pricing broadly across the company from '18 and '19? I know you're anniversarying [ph] some pricing on the cross-border side, and then maybe related to that, you know, the shift in Venmo going from operating in the red to going into the black; how should we think about or ballparking that kind of contribution in the guide? Thank you. John Rainey : Starting with pricing; pricing is something that -- as we've said before George, it's not a one-time thing for us where I've described it in the past as a sugar-high [ph] where you're trying to monetize something for the next quarter. We take a very long-term perspective to that and there are opportunities every year to look at pricing, and pricing sometimes can mean going out and taking advantage of where you provide significant value in the market and pricing higher. In other cases given the enormous addressable market that we have, it can be about capturing market share and be more aggressive on pricing; so that goes both ways. And certainly we have assumptions built into our plans about optimizing pricing in various areas going into 2019. One example of that is the recent announcement that we made about increasing our pricing to be more inline with where the market is on instant transfer, and so that's just one example that we're -- that we have there related to pricing. On Venmo, as we've said, this is -- it's hard not to be excited about some of the growth numbers that we're talking about today and the fact that each of the last three quarters we've seen a record number of net new customers come to the platform; but this is a long game and we're not going to -- we're going to be measured in terms of our approach to this, make sure that we optimize for the experience and profitability will certainly come, we've got a good history here in terms of what happened with PayPal as that moved from P2P to being able to monetize that in ways where one can shop at a merchant. And so that is a transition that will take place in a couple years not a couple of quarters, and so we expect to see improvement in our Venmo economics next year and each year, thereafter. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you, and thanks for the 2019 framework, it's encouraging. Just maybe on that, just a fairly -- a steady EPS growth for '19 adjusting for the acquisitions despite some eBay degradation that you talked about and perhaps in cross border too; I'm not sure if maybe you want to comment on your outlook for cross-border specifically but I'm curious just in the aggregate; what may be getting better? What are some of the key offsets [ph] that have given you the confidence to achieve that; that steady EPS growth in '19? John Rainey : Sure, I'll start and Dan and Bill can jump in as well. 2019, there is a lot of things in store as we sort of enter this next chapter post our previous relationship with eBay. And so excited about the partnership opportunities that are out there, we're excited about integrating some of the acquisitions that we've had and potential ones in the future and what that can mean to make our platform even better than it is today. As we look at parts of the P&L and the effect on sort of achieving that guidance into next year, we certainly expect to continue to realize operating leverage in our business. Tien-tsin, I didn't talk about this in my prepared remarks but you know, we often talk about the marginal economics of our business. In this most recent quarter, for every dollar -- incremental dollar of revenue that we brought in our non-volume related cost only went up $0.10; that is a model for scaling a platform. And as we've said before, we think that we can continue to do that. With respect to cross-border, that's an area that -- if you look at it in terms of the percentage of total volume for PayPal, it's down slightly from where it was in the previous quarter, that's in part because of mix in our business as we see things like Venmo growing more, Braintree growing more. But I think that the takeaway from this is that, if you were to go back three or four years ago when we were more of just a button on a marketplace, we were very dependent or I should our profitability was very concentrated in certain areas, and what you're seeing us evolve into as a platform is we have a much more diversified portfolio, both regionally, as well as product-wise, we're monetizing a lot of other aspects of our business that we haven't before. And so despite the fact that cross-border which is a lucrative part of our business, is a smaller overall piece of our portfolio; and eBay you can say the same thing about, you're seeing us expand our operating margin and continuing to grow earnings at a mid-20% growth rate. So we're very excited about that and it gives us confidence going into 2019. Dan Schulman : Just one or two things on top of that. You saw this quarter us adding for the first time ever over 9 million net new active accounts. And interesting at the same time, engagement growing by 9.5%; for those of you who look carefully at our engagement numbers which I know many of you do, that's the highest percentage game we've had in probably two years or so. And three years ago, we guided like 3 million to 5 million net new actives per quarter, we took that up last year to 6 million to 8 million, we're clearly at the very high-end of that; and we see that continuing as we look forward as well. And when you have your net new actives growing by 30 million to 35 million a year and your engagement growing by 8% to 10%; that bodes well as we look forward. And I would say some of the new products and services that Bill and the team are introducing or have introduced into the market, some of the new partnerships that are just coming underway right now; we feel pretty good about our position in the digital payments ecosystem right now. Operator : Our next question comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. James Fossett : I wanted to circle back to the Venmo commentary, particularly Dan, your comments that you're feeling like you're at a tipping point there. I'm just wondering if you can give us a little color on how we should think about efforts to drive increased acceptance of Venmo and where we may see some evidence of that? And I guess, dovetailing with that is that -- with kind of the new instant transfer fee structure; how should we -- like what should we be anticipating in terms of contribution to moving the monetization of Venmo forward from that particular initiative? Thank you. Dan Schulman : I'd just say first of all, again, it's early but substantial progress and the numbers we gave are month-over-month numbers, not year-over-year but month-over-month growth numbers. So you can see the acceleration that's happening. We have a very strong pipeline of large merchants, the merchants you might expect who are lining up to integrate pay with Venmo buttons. We also obviously are rolling out these smart payment button capabilities into a PayPal checkout where if it is a Venmo customer we will dynamically present they pay with Venmo button and so you'll start to see that also accelerating quite a bit. And then if you look across the monetizable services that we're offering, all of those services are benefits to the Venmo consumer and I think that's a really important point. A Venmo consumer doesn't think about engaging in a monetizable act, they think about how can I use my Venmo card to spend offline, have that come right back into my Venmo feed, share/split those purchases, and it's a value-add for them being able to take your Venmo balance and be able to spend on online merchants or on Uber; that's a value-add for them just as it is to be able to instantly gain access to their balances is a value-add to them as well. And so the more services we've put out there, and we've been careful to be sure that the services we've put out are real value-added services but the more we put out the more Venmo customers use and start to engage with that. I mentioned that you're seeing the Venmo customers engage in groceries and restaurants, these are everyday types of activities and we're really just becoming an embedded part of our Venmo customer's digital financial services life. There are other things that we're looking at going forward but we're really pleased with the efforts we have so far, and very pleased with the momentum. Bill, anything you would add on that? Bill Ready : I would just add to that that in addition to Dan's points there around how simple we're making it for merchants to add a dedicated pay with the most recent things like smart payment buttons, the integrations we've done like with Uber for example, we're seeing tremendous growth that we're quite pleased with but they're quite pleased with it as well, they're seeing this really driving engagement on the platform and the usage of Venmo is outpacing their own expectations which are certainly quite high given how rapidly they grow. And so as we continue to make merchants happy with the engagement we're driving to them; as Dan said, we're seeing a lot of merchants really line-up for that but we're providing multiple ways for users to get great new experiences and to make money by providing them great new experience whether those pay with Venmo, the card or things like instant cash out; so all of those together are really bringing great value to the user and great growth of the monetization for us. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Dan, this one is for you on the topic of partnerships which is one of the topics of the day. You have a history of converting would be enemies into friends or at least frenemies; and I'm wondering if you can comment on two groups out there that are sort of in that category, the large global merchant acquirers, and then also the Chinese digital wallets. As you think about partnerships, is there a path to converting those players? Do you see a partnership path with PayPal? Dan Schulman : Lisa, I also consider you to be one of those partners that also turns into a friend as well. So obviously, as we've moved towards customer choice and as we've moved to being an open platform our ability to now partner, it's just night and day difference from where we were two years ago. I talked about 35 -- I think we've done 37 major partnerships in the last two years, and as you know, we've started to work with and partner with some of the leading Chinese players today whether that be [indiscernible] with their international merchants, I think where PayPal is now on over 50,000 of their merchants being accepted allowing PayPal consumers outside of China to purchase from Chinese merchants. We support some 300,000 Chinese merchants who have the PayPal mark on them today, enabling consumers outside of China to purchase from those merchants. And we're looking at doing the opposite with people like Baidu and others where Chinese consumers can seamlessly pay and buy at PayPal merchants outside of China. So we think that we can facilitate cross-border for all of those players in China and in other countries. In terms of merchant acquirers, we've had a long history actually of partnering with merchant acquirers, we're very close partners with First Data. Again, a number of years ago, there is First Data against PayPal, that is not the case anymore, we work hand-in-hand together. And so, you know -- Bill, do you want to add to that? Bill Ready : Wells Fargo, Chase, I mean there is a number of major merchant acquirers that we work with, we bring in tremendous amounts of volume. And it's another example as Dan was describing of how we're able to partner with others in the ecosystem as we've made our platform more open and have really gotten focused on how we can provide value to customers in partnership with others, and acquirers are certainly one of those constituents that we were closer with. Operator : Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Let me just start off; I mean first, you have 9.1 million active accounts net new this quarter annualizing 36 million I guess per year. First of all, is there any reason why this quarter was unusual in terms of seasonality or is that now obviously better than 30 million run rate you had, call it a year ago? And then, there is the follow-up was just on the OVAS line, it was much higher than I know we in the street were -- if you can give us a little more color if that's either -- whether it's Synchrony revenue share or it's all the great stuff in Venmo we're seeing? That would be great. Dan Schulman : So first on the net new actives, nothing unusual in the quarter. As John mentioned in his remarks, nothing from the iZettle acquisition that came in there, that was 9.1 million accounts that came in naturally. We also have over 20 million merchants now on the platform too and that's growing quite nicely. So, we projected being about 30 million, we thought this year it will clearly be over that, and we see no reason for these types of numbers to be our new run rate going forward. Bill Ready : And I would just add to that, we started seeing increased consumer adoption going back a couple of years when we started getting these reductions; is that sustainable. And for the last two years you've seen us continue to drive significant improvements in net new actives, and part of that is that there has not been anyone silver bullet to -- what's bringing those new users to the platform, it's a combination of great checkout experience with things like PayPal One Touch, P2P, Choice; all these things together are bringing more and more users onto the platform, deepening engagement with them through being a great digital engagement channel with card issuers and others, it's the composite effect of all these things together. And so as Dan said, there is nothing that we see slowing that down, it's something that we think is a new normal for us in terms of the way that we're driving increased engagement and increased new users to the platform. John Rainey : And Darrin on other value-added services; there is three things probably that are influencing that and rough order of significance -- first, would be we're seeing great growth in our merchant working capital business. Recall, we've got the acquisition of Swift and we're just really pleased with how that's performing, really good growth there. Second thing that I would call out is while we sold the U.S. consumer credit portfolio we still have an international consumer credit portfolio, and that is performing very well in the entities where we've launched that. And then lastly, I would say that the profit sharing arrangement we have with Synchrony -- we still receive economic benefit depending upon the performance of that U.S. consumer credit portfolio. And we're very pleased with that, and I would venture to say Synchrony is very pleased with how it's performing as well. Dan Schulman : Thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Final question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Dan, as it has been pointed out earlier, you guys have had a lot of success over the last couple of years in signing partnerships and bringing a lot of partners onto the platform. I guess it's probably too much to ask to try and kind of quantify the impact that those -- of those partnerships or how much of an impact we've seen on TPV or revenue as it relates to those? But curious if just qualitatively you can try and give us a sense of the impact that you've seen there? And then, as it relates to the Walmart and Amex deals that have been signed, how you would sort of scale those deals relative to what we've seen from partnerships thus far? What kind of potential do you think those two deals have? Dan Schulman : So I would say just in general, we've announced quite a number of partnerships over the past couple of years. These partnerships take multiple quarters before they start to come up to speed, some of them a year plus; and so I would say we are still quite early in the impact that we are seeing from all of those partnerships. And so just from a qualitative perspective, we're beginning to see some nice momentum but I would say it's very, very early days. One example of that would be rewards points, we've got maybe four or so issuers now, major issuers who are going to be putting their reward points onto the PayPal platform. We're going to be a platform that aggregates all of those that users of our mutual customers can take those reward points, turn them into fiat currency, use the rewards points and a combination of any other financial instrument they have on board to make purchases at basically 20 million merchants across the world; it's the first time that we're giving that kind of utility, and the American Express announcement -- they are one of the -- if not the leader in rewards points and having their rewards points come onto the platform and their customers being able to use them at PayPal merchants, and the only place where they can use them at all of those different merchants, right. Amex is only integrated into a couple of merchants right now to be able to use reward points. Those are all things that are coming in the future. And I would say Walmart has a tremendous amount of potential for us, it's the largest retailer, one of the largest marketplaces, and with a lot of aspirations, and we have quite good relationship with them and a growing relationship with them. And as you see, almost every quarter we announce new partnerships and some of them can be quite large, and -- my anticipation as we look out over the next several quarters that you'll see more of those come onto play as well. This is an ongoing -- part of our strategy is to be a great partner and to be the underlying platform and the largest digital distribution channel for a lot of our partners. So we're seeing a good deal of success right now but still I would say very early innings for us in terms of the -- of what they could be and will become for us. Operator, thank you. Everybody thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you over the hours and months ahead. So thank you very much everyone for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program, you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great afternoon.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our Company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for first quarter and full year 2019, our medium-term guidance and the impact and timing of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, January 30, 2019. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information presented today. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had another strong quarter ending 2018 with a record breaking growth across a number of key customer and financial metrics. Our transformation into an open digital payments platform is clearly resonating with our customers. PayPal continues to benefit from increasing tailwinds as cash continues to digitize and more and more aspects of our lives move to mobile. Our ability to leverage these trends is reflected in both our current results and our forward-looking guidance for 2019. In 2018, we set new benchmarks in terms of spot revenue growth, net new active accounts and engagement across our platform. We developed industry defining products, acquired leading edge capabilities, strengthened existing partnerships and entered into new strategic relationships with some of the biggest, most influential global brands in technology, retail and finance. We aspire to be the de facto operating system for mobile and digital commerce around the world. Creating value for all of our partners and customers across the entire payments ecosystem, in each year we make substantial progress towards that goal. Let\u2019s start with our numbers. In 2018, we delivered $15.45 billion in revenue, up 18% on a spot basis and FX-neutral basis or 21% normalizing for the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables. That represents our highest annual spot revenue growth rate since separation. Revenues in 2018 associated with eBay grew 4%, while merchant services grew 22% more than five times that of eBay. In the fourth quarter, we generated $4.23 billion of revenue growing 14% or 21% normalized. This is the first time in our history that we surpassed $4 billion of revenue in a single quarter. And we achieved this milestone despite strong headwinds from slower than expected eBay volume growth and greater than forecasted FX pressures. For 2018, our overall payment volume grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis to $578 billion. We processed just shy of 10 billion transactions in the year. For the quarter, our TPV excluding eBay grew 29% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly outpacing the market as we continue to gain share. In the quarter, eBay had zero growth in its volume and it exit 2018 representing just 10% of our overall TPV down 300 basis points year-over-year. Our strong revenue growth and disciplined OpEx spend combined to drive a 28% year-over-year increase in 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42. In Q4, we delivered $0.69 of non-GAAP EPS up 26%. As we mentioned last quarter, we invested some of our below the line EPS benefits to drive customer acquisition and that clearly paid off. One of the clear highlights of Q4 is our net new active number. We added a record 13.8 million net new active accounts to our platform up 58% year-over-year. Approximately $2.9 million of these net new actives came from our acquisitions with almost 11 million net new actives driven organically, the best quarterly organic net new active number in PayPal\u2019s history. We added 39 million net new actives for the year. Another all time record for us. We now have 267 million active accounts on our platform with approximately 246 million consumers shopping at more than 21 million merchants. We are targeting more than 300 million active accounts on our platform by the end of 2019. Even with this acceleration in net new actives, we continue to grow our customer engagement. Engagement grew by 9%, almost 37 transactions per active account. Its drove $164 billion in TPV in the quarter, up 25% on an FX neutral basis and is our first quarter to ever exceed $150 billion of TPV. Mobile continues to drive our growth was $67 billion of mobile TPV in Q4 alone representing 41% of our total TPV. One Touch with its market leading checkout conversion rates continues to grow with over 123 million consumers and 11 million merchants opted in. Venmo continued its strong momentum this holiday season. We\u2019re witnessing significant increases and monetize the volume growth and monthly active users. This quarter we drove $19 billion in payment volume through Venmo an increase of 80% year-over-year. For the full year Venmo\u2019s volume increased 79% with $62 billion in payment volume process. And we are on pace for Venmo to drive almost the $100 billion in TPV in 2019. For the last two consecutive quarters, Venmo\u2019s TPV surpassed the volume of TPV we process from eBay. Pay with Venmo continues to attract new partners including Shopify, who BigCommerce and Jay-Z\u2019s Tidal music service. The total number of Venmo users who have made a monetizable transaction is now 29% reflecting a steady month-over-month increase. Venmo card continues to gain significant traction, instant transfer revenues continue to increase, and as a result, our Venmo initiatives have produced a revenue run rate going into 2019 that now exceeds $200 million, with the revenues being equally split between instant cash out and other monetizable services. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our revenue trends and the numerous incremental growth opportunities we see for Venmo. Braintree continued to grow impressively demonstrating its market leadership since our acquisition five years ago. Last month, we announced the Braintree platform had processed over $500 billion, an authorized payment volume since 2014 with more than 6 billion transactions last year alone. We added KFC Australia, Krispy Kreme, Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Post, Live Nation Ticketmaster, Acer Computers and Tripadvisor Experiences to its platform, joining a powerful list of leading mobile apps using Braintree, such as Uber, Wish, Boxed, Facebook and Airbnb. PayPal\u2019s opportunities to expand internationally continue to grow, with our global FI, tech and merchant partnerships continuing to multiply. Two countries I\u2019d like to highlight our India and Japan. In India, we have benefited from strong consumer demand since we went live in late 2017. In 2019, we will continue to invest in frictionless experiences for everyday payments by Indian consumers. We\u2019re expanding our merchant and financial institution partnerships throughout the countries ecosystem, bringing a truly global platform experience to India\u2019s consumers and merchants. I\u2019m also pleased with our progress in Japan. We\u2019ve launched a suite of services that unlocks the network effects of the PayPal platform for merchants and consumers there. For the consumer, this includes One Touch payment, buyer protection and instant bank funding. Japanese merchants also benefit from instant settlement as well as the increase in customer acquisition and conversion, we see in other countries around the world from One Touch. We have also added ANA Airlines, the largest airline in Japan to our growing merchant base. We\u2019ve now secured partnerships with over 20 top tier global financial institutions, including eight of the top 10 banks in the U.S. In 2018, we saw nearly 40 bank led marketing campaigns that encourage their customers to pay with PayPal. One of the most exciting features to come out of our financial institution relationships is enabling our mutual consumers to use their credit card reward points as a tender type in the PayPal wallet. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we launched this capability was sitting and discover at the end of Q4 and plan to roll this out to multiple partners in 2019 including Chase, Amex, and Barclaycard. It\u2019s been estimated that nearly 10 billion of reward points go unused every year in the U.S. alone, helping to address that issue as a huge opportunity for consumers and is yet another way that our two-sided platform is connecting consumers and merchants in unique and powerful ways. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Bill, who will provide additional color on some of our other recent partnerships. Bill Ready : Thanks, Dan. It was clear that PayPal is becoming the payment platform of choice for marketplaces and multi-seller e-commerce platforms. Our top 20 partners and marketplaces, total payment volume excluding eBay grew by over 40% in 2018, reaching nearly $85 billion. This segment of our business is now much larger and faster growing than our legacy eBay marketplace business. And we expect this growth to continue in 2019 as we expand our current partnerships and welcome new partners onto our platform. We\u2019re working with some of the leading companies and their respective industries, including Etsy, Uber, Airbnb, Grubhub and Pinterest. In Q4, we began piloting One Touch seller signup with noteworthy partners, including Walmart. One Touch seller signup significantly reduces the friction of signing up to sell in a new marketplace for merchants and helps marketplaces connect with sellers that have a proven history with PayPal. One of the most pronounced trends in e-commerce over the past several years has been the many new and rapidly growing forums for small businesses to sell to customers around the world. PayPal is helping merchants to manage and grow their business across those new forums, and now with One Touch seller signup, we\u2019re making it easier than ever for merchants to begin selling in a new marketplace or digital channel. In fact, those merchants that are using PayPal to sell across multiple channels already grow at nearly three times the rate of those that sell on only one marketplace. Through PayPal for partners in marketplaces and One Touch seller signup, we\u2019re connecting small businesses and merchants of all sizes to all the best places to sell, giving them the opportunity to reach more buyers and drive greater sales. Connecting our 21 million plus merchants to customers, wherever they shop is a core element of our efforts to democratize access to the digital economy. We believe these partnerships and increasing use of our PayPal for partners and marketplaces product will help to seamlessly connect buyers and sellers and the world\u2019s highest growth market places and digital sales channels, ultimately making the digital economy more accessible for consumers and merchants around the world. Additionally, we\u2019re announcing today that we have entered into a strategic partnership with Paymentus, an electronic billing service company that provides e-bill presentment, management and payment capabilities to large scale merchants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. PayPal will enable payment processing for Paymentus transactions including debit card, credit card and ACH through our Braintree platform, as well as PayPal, Venmo and PayPal credit payment options for existing in new merchants. Additionally, we will leverage the Paymentus platform to enable a consumer bill payment experience within the PayPal app. Not only will billers on the Paymentus platform be able to present bills to PayPal consumers directly, but this feature will also allow other billers and billing platforms to present bills to PayPal consumers enable payment with PayPal. This opens up bill payment as a vertical for us. And overall, bill payment has the potential to generate tens of billions of dollars of payment volume. Dan, I\u2019ll hand it back to you now. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Bill. It\u2019s great to see deep relationships like those we have with Walmart and now Paymentus that utilize the full scope of PayPal's platform to drive mutual value for our joint customers. We expect to welcome additional partnerships throughout 2019. I like to end my remarks by recognizing the extraordinary generosity of our customers. We shattered our previous giving Tuesday record this holiday season with nearly $98 million donated to charitable causes in just one day. And for the full year, more than $9.5 billion was donated to non-profit organizations across the world through the PayPal platform. It means a lot to all of us at PayPal that our platform can be used to make such a large difference to non-profits and charities across the globe. 2018 was a strong year for us with record revenue and net new actives and we are well positioned to continue that growth. The network effects of our scale continue to accelerate. Our breadth of services and products go well beyond checkout and we are increasingly seen as a must have platform for retailers, who are battling for relevance in the era of digital commerce. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we are demonstrating in monetizing Venmo and I\u2019m confident it will generate significant revenues and profits in the years ahead. Our various international efforts are ramping and 2019 is shaping up to be another strong year. We\u2019ll need to execute against the backdrop of an unpredictable world economy, but we have the tools and capabilities to continue our growth and progress in the years to come. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John. John? John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I\u2019d also like to thank all of our customers, partners and employees for making 2018 a great year. We achieved notable milestones and are pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished. In 2018, we delivered significant innovation across our platform, introducing new features and services for our consumers and merchants globally. We also made four acquisitions that have expanded our offerings in addressable markets, completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio, which resulted in approximately $6.5 billion of cash proceeds and announced key issuer technology and merchant partnerships. Entering in 2019, we are well positioned to build on our momentum and continue delivering strong revenue growth with margin expansion. We remain focused on creating long-term sustainable shareholder value. I\u2019d now like to discuss our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume was $164 billion, an increase of 23% at spot and 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Our 2018 acquisitions contributed approximately two points of growth. Merchant services volume on a currency-neutral basis grew 29% to $147 billion. P2P volume, which is part of merchant services, grew 46% to $39 billion and represented approximately 24% of total payment volume versus 20% in Q4 last year. In comparison on a foreign currency-neutral basis, we saw no growth in volume associated with eBay and on a spot basis, this volume declined approximately $300 million from Q4, 2017. eBay marketplaces represented 10% of volume on our platform down from 13% in the fourth quarter last year. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 14% on both a spot and a currency-neutral basis to $4.23 billion. Adjusting for the sale of receivables to Synchrony, revenue growth would have been approximately 21%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5 points to revenue growth in the quarter. The translation effect from the stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue by $63 million. This impact was offset by $39 million in revenue from our hedge program. As a result, the net effect of the stronger dollar was a headwind of $24 million in the quarter. Exiting 2018, at current rates, we estimate that our hedge positions would result in the recognition of $171 million in international transaction revenue in 2019. U.S. revenue grew 9% versus Q4 2017 and approximately 20% adjusting for the credit receivable sell. International revenue grew 19% on a currency neutral basis. On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 19% in the quarter. Revenue from other value-added services declined 19%. Normalizing for the receivable sell revenue from other value-added services would have grown approximately 35%. In the quarter, we recognized approximately $55 million of revenue from Synchrony related to transitioning loan, servicing and collections. Revenue from our eBay marketplaces was lower than expected in the quarter. On average for the eight quarters preceding Q4 2018 volume related to eBay grew 6% currency neutral. On the same basis, this growth rate dropped to zero in the fourth quarter. For the first time in two years, revenue declined versus the prior year's quarter. This decline was unrelated to the transition to manage payments, which had no material impact on our results. Despite this, geographic and product diversification, including from our acquisitions, Venmo monetization, and our growing APAC business allowed us to continue to deliver solid revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.35%. This is the first sequential increase in transaction take rate since separation versus Q4 2017, transaction take rate declined 9 basis points, which is the lowest level of decline we've experienced on a year-over-year basis. Growth in our P2P business, continued deceleration of eBay and lower cross-border volumes contributed to the reduction in transaction take rate. Total take rate in Q4 was flat sequentially and down 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of the receivable sell. Both transaction take rate and total take rate benefited from revenue related to our hedge gains. Volume based expenses increased 21% in Q4 to $1.9 billion. Transaction expense represented 96 basis points as a rate of TPV, flat sequentially and versus last year. We saw an increase in card-based funding, which was offset by P2P growth. Transaction loss was 18 basis points as a rate of TPV, flat sequentially and an improvement of 1 basis point versus Q4 2017. And improvement in our Venmo loss rate contributed to the stronger performance versus last year. Loan loss was 3 points as a rate of TPV. Transaction margin dollars grew 9% from the fourth quarter last year to $2.3 billion. Transaction margin as a rate was 55%, flat sequentially and the decline of approximately 250 basis points from 2017. The reduction in revenue from the receivable sale, which began to affect other value-added services in Q3 2018 in conjunction with the related held for sale accounting treatment, which started in Q4 2017 affected both the growth and transaction margin dollars as well as the rate. Non-transaction related expenses grew 7% versus last year. Growth in these expenses was affected by both the lapping of the held for sale accounting changes, which resulted in a lower rate of growth year-over-year, as well as an increase in non-transaction related expenses related to our acquisitions. Normalizing for both of these non-transaction related expenses grew 9%. When we reported Q3 results in October, we indicated that we expected to see higher than usual below the line benefits in the fourth quarter and discussed our plans to opportunistically reinvest this upside. Accordingly, in the quarter, we ramped our spend in several key strategic investment areas including sales and marketing, which increased 21%. General and administrative expenses grew 27% in the fourth quarter, predominantly driven by acquisition related costs. In the aggregate, our 2018 acquisitions added approximately 5.5 points of growth to the increase in non-transaction related expenses in the fourth quarter. Operating income grew 13% to $913 million, and operating margin declined 20 basis points year-over-year in Q4. Adjusting for acquisitions, operating margin was expanded to 80 basis points. Other income in the quarter increased by $67 million, primarily due to net unrealized gains and minority investments. Strong revenue growth and operating efficiencies resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 26% to $0.69. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $10 billion and short-term borrowings of $2 billion. Free cash flow in the quarter was $910 million, which equates to $0.22 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue generated. I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter of 2019. The guidance we are providing today is in line with the preliminary outlook we provided in October when we reported our third quarter results. For the full year 2019, we expect TPV to grow in the mid-20's percentage range. We expect to generate revenue between $17.85 billion and $18.1 billion representing currency neutral growth of 16% to 17% or 21% to 21% adjusting for the sale to Synchrony. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.84 to $2.91, representing growth of 17% to 20%. Our guidance includes the expectation that our 2018 acquisitions will contribute approximately 1.5 points of growth to revenue in 2019 and $0.08 to $0.10 of dilution to earnings per share. In 2019, we plan to deliver operating margin expansion with continued operating leverage and efficiencies more than offsetting this dilutive effect. In 2020, we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings. The diversity of our business is allowing us to maintain our guidance ranges, while absorbing a number of headwinds as we enter 2019. While the lack of eBay growth remains a challenge and geopolitical uncertainty is affecting growth in places like China and Europe, we are confident in our ability to offset these headwinds through new sources of growth, including our expanding marketplace relationships, Venmo monetization, domestic India, as well as the strong secular growth driving digital payments and mobile commerce. We anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be between 17% and 19%. For 2019, we anticipate free cash flow will exceed $3 billion. With approximately $10 billion in cash and an investment grade debt rating, we are in a strong position to continue to invest with discipline in PayPal's growth. In 2018, we returned more than $3.5 billion to cash in cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and spent approximately $2.7 billion on acquisitions. In 2019, we will continue to balance investment with return of capital, while maintaining an efficient capital structure. Our acquisition pipeline is healthy and our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to move quickly and be opportunistic. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to be a consolidator. At the same time, we plan to continue to return cash to shareholders consistent with our stated commitment for capital return. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.08 billion to $4.13 million or 11% to 13% growth on a currency neutral basis. Adjusted for the sale to Synchrony, we expect that this growth rate would be 19% to 20%. In the first quarter, we are currently forecasting the continuation of several of the trends that emerged in the back half of 2018. These include weak eBay performance as well as the more challenging macro in China and the UK. Our plans also anticipate a stronger dollar relative to the euro, pound and Canadian dollar to continue to be a headwind in Q1. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. In summary, we are pleased with our performance and the progress we've made growing our business and advancing our competitive positioning. In 2018, we had many operational and financial accomplishments. A few notable milestones include surpassing 250 million active accounts, Venmo surpassing eBay and total payment volume on our platform, processing more than $50 billion of payment volume in a single month and generating both $4 billion in revenue and more than $1 billion in profit before taxes for the first time in a quarter. We delivered a great year and our 2018 results leave us on strong footing to pursue our strategic objectives in 2019 and beyond. Our team is focused on disciplined execution against our priorities and moving our business forward. As 2019 begins, we find ourselves operating in a macro environment characterized by more variability. From what we see, economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate. We have a well diversified portfolio of products and markets in which we operate and are prepared to react should economic conditions change. We remain committed to our long-term financial targets and are confident that the strength of our business, flexibility of our balance sheet and operational discipline will allow us to continue delivering value to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Hey, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate all the detail. I wanted to ask for the first time looking at the fourth quarter, you didn\u2019t exceed your revenue outlook. I think for the first time in awhile so. But maybe you can comment on maybe what surprised you or can you read maybe what was a little bit softer than expected? John Rainey : Sure, Tien-tsin. This is John. It\u2019s good to speak with you. Our revenue fell within the range that we provided a little bit lower than the midpoint, but as we look at what transpired during the quarter, there are two things that stand out that I think are most notable. The first, as we discussed in our prepared remarks is eBay. And I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll give you some context to that had eBay performed for us in the fourth quarter like it did in the third quarter that would have been an incremental $32-ish million for the quarter. The other headwind was a currency FX and we talked about that was an impact of $24 million to our quarter. So if you just took those two, we would have been well above the guidance range that we provided. Other than that, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter, but I think it also demonstrates the diversity of our portfolio given that we\u2019ve got so many different geographies in which we operate as well so many different product offerings that we have. But those are the two things that stand out. Tien- tsin Huang : All right. That\u2019s helpful and make a lot of sense. Maybe quick follow-up if you don\u2019t mind. Just I wanted to ask last year, active user growth was a really nice surprise that validated the growth and momentum in the business. I\u2019m curious if looking at 2019, what metric might emerge this year for us to watch kind of like what we saw with the active user growth last year? Could it be engagement, Venmo monetization, choice adoption? Just trying to think what we should hone in on. Thanks. Dan Schulman : Hi Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Dan. So yes, clearly net new actives this year were big highlight for us. We drove $39 million in the year, $11 million organic in the fourth quarter alone. Those are big records for us. And at the same time that we were driving that surgeon net new actives engagement was going up to \u2013 went up 9%, now at 37%. So you\u2019ve got a whole host of new net new actives coming on, engagement going up. And for us, those are the two key metrics that we look at. I mean those, everyone looks at financial metrics, but what drives our financial metrics are, how many net new customers are we bringing on and what kind of engagement are we driving with them. And I think by the way, 2019 is going to be another strong quarter. We ended with 267 million net new actives. We said we\u2019re going to have \u2013 we\u2019re targeting more than 300 million actives on the platform by the end of 2019. So obviously 2019 is going to we think going to be another strong quarter for that. I would say though, the one thing that we\u2019re looking at and we\u2019re quite pleased with is really the rapid adoption of monetizable services on Venmo. We exit 2018 north of a $200 million revenue run rate on Venmo. That\u2019s from literally almost nothing. Months and months ago from when we first started on that or beginning of the year, so you\u2019re seeing a lot of people have questioned can we monetize I mean Venmo. And what we\u2019ve always said about monetizing Venmo is it\u2019s not monetizing so much. Its adding value-added services that actually increase the value that a Venmo user gets by being part of that Venmo platform. And so we\u2019re seeing accelerating growth on that. And we don\u2019t want to get again too far ourselves on that. But I would say we\u2019re pretty pleased with what we\u2019re seeing on Venmo. It\u2019s really gone from strength to strength. Tien- tsin Huang : All right, I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Dan Schulman : Hi, Darrin. Darrin Peller : Hey guys. Hey Dan, thanks. I do want to hone in on that net new user growth. It was much bigger than we saw in the past couple of quarters. I mean again, if you back, I mean I just had a 11 million new users was, I think a record, as you said on a quarterly basis. So just give us a little more color if you don\u2019t mind, on the breakdown of that, how much of that has Venmo. And then I mean you talked about I think $30 million you exceeded that as you mentioned quite a bit for the year, almost $39 million, I think it was. So is there a number we can look to 2019 on that front. And then just what kinds of engagement plans do you have to really enhance that, but we thought that was a standout number. Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yes, thanks. So just do quick math for this year. Yes, we wound up at 267 million actives on the platform. We\u2019re targeting more than 300 million at the end of this year. You do the math there, we\u2019re saying at least another $33 million coming onto in the year. And so I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable number to be thinking about. So what\u2019s happening with that? Now how is that driving, what some color around that, that really the majority is core PayPal. And then you\u2019ve got Venmo continuing quarter after quarter after quarter to have incredibly strong net new actives. I mean the virality of Venmo and the network effects on core PayPal are clearly coming into play. I know you\u2019ve got 21 million plus merchants accepting PayPal. Consumers see that want to be a part of it. You\u2019ve got 246 million plus consumers using PayPal. Every merchant now wants to be a part of that. So you\u2019ve got a good network effect both on core PayPal and on Venmo. And then I think what\u2019s really important a lot of people think about the top of the funnel, but really net new actives is a combination of top of the funnel and bottom. So our churn rate is improving as well. Why is the churn rate improving? It\u2019s improving because the customer experiences and the breadth of services that consumers are utilizing with us and their engagement is increasing. I give a ton of credit to Bill and his team for creating those experiences, because I really think we\u2019re moving towards best-in-class, whether that\u2019s checkout with that be p-to-p experiences, whether that be our mobile app, whether it be choice as well. These are all driving increased engagement and helping at the bottom part of the funnel. One other thing that I mentioned in my remarks that should be emphasized is we\u2019re finally beginning to see as we said we would the impact of all these partnerships beginning to drive a noticeable amount of net new actives onto the platform. We saw over 40 bank led marketing campaigns that encourage their customers to come onto the platform. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing that because we have a great partnership together. It drives ton of incremental value and volume to our FI partners. And it\u2019s clearly a win-win for both of us. And then I talked a little bit about it. Our architecture now and our software stack is now more able to be deployed in a more wholesome manner across the world. And so we\u2019re able to deliver more and more experiences and products to multiple countries. I pointed out India and Japan, but that would be true in countries like France and others as well where we\u2019re beginning to see an uptick in net new actives globally as well. And so I think we\u2019ve got still a lot of a runway when it comes to net new actives and I believe you\u2019ll see another good number posted from us this year. Darrin Peller : That\u2019s great. Thanks, guys. Dan Schulman : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Dan Schulman : Hey, James. James Faucette : Thank you very much. Hey, good afternoon everybody. I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up question on eBay and whether the \u2013 I guess, a little bit slower transaction volume now was the result of their experimentation with other payment methods or if you just think that it was overall slower than what you had thought transaction volumes on the platform overall. Hopefully that question makes sense. And then the second, I guess, part of my question is related to Venmo monetization. You gave a target for 2019. How should we think about the contribution of that from merchants versus things like Instant Transfer, et cetera? Thank you very much. Dan Schulman : You bet, James. Thanks for those two good questions. I\u2019ll take the first one around eBay, and Bill will take the second part around Venmo. So on the eBay side, we saw this on their conference call as well. Clearly, Marketplaces is slowing down for them. As John mentioned in his remarks, we saw zero growth in TPV on that. And if you look at what they announced on their call for intermediated payments, it\u2019s well less than 1% of the GMV that we see presented to us. So it really was not the impact. They clearly are slowing in their marketplace growth. And as John said, part of this is \u2013 for us, is we\u2019re able to absorb that because of the breadth of our portfolio and our capabilities. I think that\u2019s a really important thing to highlight. Because volume was going to be leaving eBay. It\u2019s leaving now in a much more straight line, unfortunately, because they\u2019re not having the growth that I\u2019m sure they hope to drive as well in Marketplace. And so at the end of our operating agreement, which is 18 months from now when they finally move into intermediated payments which could be 24, 36 months from now, eBay is going to be a much smaller part of our business than even any of us initially thought when we were talking about this originally. And so the fact that we\u2019re affirming our annual guidance that we gave three months ago, we feel very comfortable with that both on the top and the bottom line, I think really just highlights just how diversified our platform is. We\u2019re welcoming new partners like Paymentus. I mean, Paymentus could be one of our top 10 customers with the volumes that they\u2019re driving. You\u2019ve got Venmo monetization really accelerating. And I\u2019ll let Bill talk about that right now. But I think we\u2019re just seeing slower eBay growth. And I think we\u2019re seeing strength to our platform to offset that, which all in, as we look over the medium and long-term, actually is probably a positive. Bill Ready : Yes. And on Venmo monetization, your question there asking about the composition, if you\u2019ve asked us a few months ago, I think the perception was that most of the monetization happening there was around Instant Cash Out. And one of the things that we feel really great about that $200 million-plus annual revenue run rate that we exited the year out is that it actually split about evenly between Instant Cash Out and the commerce-related items and other items where we monetize, be they Venmo card, Pay with Venmo and the related services around that. So we see each of those, Instant Cash Out, Venmo card and Pay with Venmo, all growing really, really nicely. Dan talked about in his comments some of the fantastic brands have come on to Venmo. We launched with Uber in August and September of 2018. We\u2019ve really seen that ramp nicely as well as other great services like Hulu and others that have come on to Venmo. So we\u2019re really seeing the commerce side of Venmo gain traction, food ordering services like Grubhub and seamless Uber Eats. These are \u2013 many of these are daily, high-frequency type transactions. We see the same with the card \u2013 really getting into everyday spend. So we really feel great about the broad base set of monetization initiatives across Venmo. It is far more than just Instant Cash Out. Dan Schulman : Yes. And you\u2019re seeing more and more of the user base of Venmo understand that we have these new value-added services. I think the number of users went from 24% to 29%, so a nice increase quarter-over-quarter. One of the things I forgot to say is on the eBay side. One thing Bill mentioned in his remarks, and I think it\u2019s very important, is that we are now working with marketplaces. Around the world, that last year alone did $85 billion in TPV. Significantly larger than eBay growing at 41% overall. We expect more partnerships like that to come onto those marketplace solutions. And what we\u2019re doing there is helping sellers sell in multiple marketplaces using PayPal. This One Touch seller activation allows a seller, say an eBay seller, to sign up for a marketplace, literally take all of their information, sign up and start making transactions with almost one touch, one click. And so \u2013 and when sellers do that, their sales increase, at least with PayPal, an average of about three times. So we think we can help small businesses through these new capabilities and certainly drive a ton of marketplace growth overall, both with eBay and outside of eBay, especially with these kinds of capabilities. James Faucette : Great, thanks very much. Dan Schulman : Yes. You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heath Terry : Great, thank you. So there\u2019s obviously been a lot of discussion around the net new actives added in the quarter and over the course of the year, but just wanted to dig into that a little bit deeper. Assuming, and feel free to correct me if this is the wrong assumption, but assuming that these net new actives start off at a lower level of activity, is there any way to quantify the increase in activity among the existing base of users, kind of like a same-store sales number or something? Or alternatively, what TPV will look like when these users reach the level of activity that you see among your average user? Bill Ready : Hi, this is Bill. A related element, which I think will mitigate some of what you\u2019re asking is as we look at each of those cohorts that comes on and how those cohorts mature, a related question we often get is that as we have accelerated the number of net new actives, do we see any deterioration in the quality of those cohorts? Do they mature more slowly? Are they less active? And one of the great things is that even we have significantly increased the number of net new actives coming onto the platform each quarter, each new cohort, we see stronger than the last in terms of how they engage and how they mature over time. So while we don\u2019t break out the maturation to the level of detail you\u2019re asking about, even as we\u2019ve gotten to larger and larger cohorts, we see each new cohort being stronger than the cohorts from years past, which is part of why you also see engagement. Oftentimes, a large influx of net new actives will have a dilutive effect on engagement, you still see us having really strong engagement growth even as we bring those on largely because of the quality of the cohorts, rather than diminishing it as you get to larger cohorts, is actually improving because we\u2019re getting those larger cohorts through an expanded set of products and user engagement with more and more products over time. Dan Schulman : But your question is a good one. We won't do the math for you, but obviously when you bring on almost 14 million net new actives in the quarter, the number of transactions that they've done is very small, right, because you brought them on throughout the quarter. So it's a dilutive effect to the growth of your overall base engagement scores. So it's obviously higher than the numbers that we report because of that \u2013 just because of that math around that. And so that's why we're so pleased to show kind of a steady increase in engagement. So at 9% last quarter, I believe, 9% this quarter. And so even as you're seeing that substantial increase, you're seeing a steadying amount. As that normalizes, you'll start to see that creep up that percent engagement. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Bill. Dan Schulman : Yes. You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Dan Schulman : Hello, Lisa. Lisa Ellis : Hi. I'll direct this one to Bill. Because you commented in your prepared remarks around the role that PayPal is playing with these other marketplaces. I wanted to ask specifically about some of the e-comm enablement players, players like Shopify and Wix that are starting to make some noise around creeping into payments. How do you think about the role of PayPal views to be those players? I mean, would those be potential acquisition candidates or are they more like, it would make more sense to partner? Or are they actually more like frenemies? How do you think about that group? Bill Ready : We partner with a wide range of these ecommerce enablement players. And even as they're bundling payments into their offerings, oftentimes we are working closely with them to help make that happen in PayPal branded payments would be a very meaningful part of that for many of those players. Given to the cater to small businesses and small businesses really rely upon the trust that PayPal brings for the buyer where our conversion differences that already out shine competitors across the industry and a small business context particularly these types of platforms. The relative conversion rate of PayPal versus something else can even further apart. So we tend to have really strong partnerships there. And I think that really ties into what we were talking about with our efforts to get small businesses to all the best forums to sell. I think, we've been talking a lot about the deceleration of eBay. One of the things that has happened is that over the last decade, small businesses that would have had only one or a couple of places to sell a decade ago, now have many, many places to sell. And PayPal is connecting those small businesses to the many places they sell. Some of those might be ecommerce enablement platforms like some of the ones you mentioned, some of that maybe other marketplaces, some of that may be more vertical specific offerings. But across each of those we're helping to connect those small businesses to all the very best places to sell, which is why when we talk about our marketplace and partners business outside of eBay that's already $85 billion-plus in volume much larger than eBay overall and growing at 40%-plus year-on-year. So these small businesses are finding lots of other great places to sell like ecommerce enablement platforms or rapid growth marketplaces, we tend to be a preferred provider to connect those small businesses to those platforms. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. And do they leverage like PayPal services, like your \u2013 like working capital services or the invoicing capabilities. Do those actually get \u2013 do you sort of like deliver those directly to the merchants or does that actually also work through those platforms? Would look to enable those capabilities on their platforms? Bill Ready : It really can be both. One of the things you see oftentimes those merchants are coming to us directly for those because the trend that you see is that merchants are not choosing one platform to sell in, they are choosing many to sell in. And then PayPal becomes the aggregation point for them to connect to each of those platforms. And so like with one touch seller sign up, as they're discovering more and more new platforms out there. One of the most difficult things for that small business is the sign up and vetting process. The marketplace has to figure out, is that business trustworthy or not, are they fraudulent and we're able to alleviate those pain points, not only for the seller to sign up, but also for the marketplace to know that they're bringing on a trustworthy seller to their platform. So we become an aggregation point for that small business. And some of those services were able to partner with other marketplaces or ecommerce enablement platforms. Some of those we provide directly to the merchant, since we are an aggregation point for them across many of those marketplaces and digital channels. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Bill Ready : Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open. George Mihalos : Hey guys, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask as a point of clarification. John, if we look at the guide for next year, on the surface, you're sort of reiterating it. But it appears you're absorbing, say another point or so hit from lower eBay growth and then added to that the FX. I'm just curious, is that the right way to think about it that the core business outside of that is accelerating and if there's anything else in there? And then just secondly, as we think of Venmo at this sort of $200 million plus run rate, is there anything you can say about the profitability of the business of the segment here? Is that in the black right now with this run rate? Thank you. John Rainey : Sure. George, it's good to speak with you. I'm going to take your second question first and then go back to the question before that. No, Venmo is not in the black yet. And I don't want to be specific with profitability of any one part of our business. This is not something we do, but I can give you some color in terms of how we think about this internally. Prior to some of the great progress that we've made in monetizing Venmo this year. And we effectively we're providing a service that we weren't monetizing in any way. And so the losses were growing as volume grew. And the first priority for us was to stop that rate of loss from growing. And we've done that. The next phase for us is to get Venmo to breakeven and that's not something that's going to happen in the next quarter or two, but there's a line of sight to that with what we're doing. And then the third phase is to really put our foot on the pedal and see the same type of profitability in this platform or more perhaps that we do with PayPal and some of our other services. So that's where we are with that right now. But no, it's not, in the black today. With respect to 2019 and the guide, you're right, we are seeing really strong performance, with the core business. We also have a \u2013 we've launched new products that are pretty early on yes, and partnerships. And we're pretty excited about the promise that those hold. And so just from a revenue side and a volume growth side, there's a lot of opportunity there. Also, because I'm the CFO, I'd be remiss not to mention what's being done on the expense side. The teams across the board, our commercial teams, Bill's teams, even the more staff group functions are doing a really good job of growing but not having our costs grow in line with that volume. And again, that goes back to an effort that the broad team did began 18 to 24 months ago where we talked about rewiring our business to allow us to grow at a very low marginal cost. And this is a complete team effort. There's not necessarily one area that I can point to. This is across every aspect of our company. And so, with that, we hope to have another year like we did in 2018 where you're seeing a significant earnings per share growth and revenue growth and continuing to create a lot of shareholder value for our investors. Dan Schulman : Great. Well, thanks again everybody for joining us. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great afternoon.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the first quarter 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our Company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, please note that beginning with the first quarter of 2019, we reclassified certain operating expenses within our consolidated statements of income. These changes have no impact on the Company\u2019s previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods. On April 9, 2019, we\u2019ve furnished an 8-K to the SEC that details these reclassifications. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full-year 2019, and the impact and timing of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, April 24, 2019. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we generated $4.13 billion in revenue, in line with our expectations. This represents year-over-year growth of 12% on an FX neutral basis or approximately 19% revenue growth, normalized for the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables. For the first quarter, we delivered $0.78 of non-GAAP EPS, $0.08 of which came as a result of our recent MercadoLibre investment. Excluding that gain, we delivered $0.70 in Q1, up 23% year-over-year, outperforming our expectation. Once again, a highlight of the quarter was our growth in both net new active and engagement. We added 9.3 million net new actives in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. We now have 277 million active accounts on our platform, with approximately 255 million consumers shopping at 22 million merchants. We are on pace to exceed 300 million active accounts by year end. We added 40 million net new actives in the past 12 months, an all-time record. That is over 2 times our trajectory from just two years ago. And even as we add record net new actives, our customer engagement continues to grow. Engagement grew by 9% to 38 transactions per active account. This increasing use of our platform helped to drive $161 billion of TPV in the quarter, up 25% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with the past two quarters. Total payment volume excluding eBay grew 29% on an FX-neutral basis, outpacing the overall payments market as we continue to gain share. eBay had negative TPV growth of 4% this quarter, and now represents just 9.7% of our overall TPV. Our Merchant Services TPV growth rate has accelerated over the past two quarters, offsetting a 700 basis-point decline in eBay\u2019s TPV the growth rate during that same period. Mobile continues to fuel our growth with over 66 billion of mobile TPV in Q1. And One Touch with 136 million consumers and 12.1 million merchants remains the clear market leader in mobile checkout with almost 2 times the conversion of competing wallets. Venmo continues its significant momentum. At the end of Q1, over 40 million active Venmo customers drove significant increases in volume growth and monetizable transactions. Venmo total payment volume increased 73% year-over-year to $21 billion and we remain on pace to drive nearly $100 billion in TVP through Venmo in 2019. As user growth continues to accelerate, merchants are increasingly turning to Venmo as a way to attract a valuable and engaged consumer base. For example, in the first quarter, we launched a customer engagement partnership with [indiscernible], engaging customers through Venmo payouts to drive awareness for their new rewards program. In less than one week, they surpassed their launch campaign objective with 1 million signups. And this is just the beginning of brands leveraging Venmo to drive engagement and conversation within the social feeds. In January, we reported that Venmo had an annualized revenue run rate going into 2019 that exceeded $200 million. I'm very pleased to report that our annual revenue run rate coming out of Q1 is now over $300 million. And with over 40 million active users growing substantially each and every quarter, we fully expect to see that annualized revenue number continue to grow. In addition to Venmo, core peer to peer continues to experience strong growth. P2P is the large source of net new active users on our platform, as well as a significant driver of lifetime value. Total P2P volume was $42 billion, growing 41% year-over-year. Over the past several years, we've announced more than 40 partnerships with leaders across the tech and financial services industries. These partnerships have enabled new experiences for customers and have helped to connect business and consumers across new platforms and marketplaces. Last month, we extended our partnership with Facebook to support the payments infrastructure for Instagram shopping, starting in the U.S. which will allow users on the platform to pay in context using their PayPal account or with other financial instruments. We are building deep platform integrations with Facebook, which also include product experiences within Facebook messenger and donations. Instagram shopping is an important expansion of our strategic relationship as we work to create new experiences for our joint customers. We continue to help consumers and businesses get faster access to their money. We are rolling out the ability to complete instant transfer to bank accounts for consumers and businesses in the U.S. with international expansion expected in the near future. For too long, digital payments offered a faster and better technology, but in many cases it actually made getting access to money slower. We\u2019ve launched multiple initiatives over the last few years to get people and businesses more ways to instantly move money using their PayPal account. Through our partnership with JPMorgan Chase, PayPal is one of the first companies to introduce real-time payments for both consumers and merchants as part of our ongoing effort to offer our customers faster and flexible access to their funds. Our $750 million investment in MercadoLibre was a meaningful development in our drive to increase our international scope and scale. We expect to significantly expand our footprint with a strong global partnership. Our aspiration is to be the global digital payments platform of choice for merchants and consumers around the world. Our full suite of services and products are intended to bring everyone into the digital economy. MercadoLibre is one of the largest online commerce and payments ecosystems in Latin America. Our two companies share a common vision. We both want to help small businesses compete globally and offer innovative, financial solutions to help people that may be underserved by the traditional financial system. By working closely together, we can jointly leverage our scale and platform capabilities to help drive inclusion and access to the global digital economy. As part of our investment, our teams are working hard to develop a robust commercial agreement that brings together our respective payments capabilities to unleash incremental value to our combined 500 million plus customers around the world. We look forward to sharing more about our plans to work together as we finalize our agreement. I would like to end my remarks by reiterating our commitment to our values and to being a role model corporate citizen. I strongly believe that company is in stand [ph] up and take responsibility to adjust the issues that face every global citizen. In a few days, we will release our Annual Global Impact report, highlighting the progress we've made in driving social impact, managing our environmental footprint and supporting our employees and their communities. We had a strong start to 2019 and we remain confident in the annual targets we outlined during our last earnings call. We will continue operating in a disciplined manner, leveraging our wide range of unique assets, strategically investing, both organically and inorganically with the goal of strengthening our two-sided platform. We look forward to delivering another strong set of results this coming year. And with that I'll turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. We started the year with the great first quarter. Our financial and operational performance was a continuation of our trends exiting 2018. Our results demonstrate the increasing relevance, functionality and utility of our payments platform. We delivered solid volume and revenue growth with strong expense discipline and earnings growth. Importantly, similar to the fourth quarter of last year, we achieved these results in the face of declining eBay volumes, ongoing year-over-year pressure from a stronger dollar and a continued mixed macro environment. Overall, our first quarter performance is consistent with the recent results that our business has been delivering in terms of growth, volume based expense dynamics as well as operating leverage in our non-transaction related expenses. I will discuss our financial results and then I will spend some time on our investment in MercadoLibre, our restructuring charge and our updated guidance. Revenue in the first quarter increased 12% on both the spot and currency neutral basis, to $4.13 billion. Adjusting for the sale of receivables to synchrony, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5 points to revenue growth in the quarter. The translation effect from the stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue by $116 million. This impact was offset by $52 million in revenue from hedge gains. As a result, the net effect of the stronger dollar was a revenue headwind of $64 million in the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 8% versus Q1 2018, and approximately 22% adjusting for the credit receivable sale. International revenue grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis. On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 17% in the quarter. Revenue from other value-added services declined 19%. Normalizing for the receivable sales this revenue would have grown approximately 35%. In the quarter, we recognized $55 million of revenue from Synchrony related to transitional loan servicing and collections. In the first quarter, transaction take rate was 2.31%. Compared to Q1 2018 transaction take rate declined 11 basis points. Strong P2P growth contributed to two thirds of the decline. Weakness in eBay\u2019s marketplaces business as well as pressure on some of our key cross-border corridors from stronger dollar were also drivers of the reduction in transaction take rate. Total take rate in Q1 declined 22 basis points from the prior year. Approximately two thirds of this decline was attributable to the credit receivables sale. The same factors that affect the transaction take rate also contributed to the decline in our total take rate. Both, transaction take rate and total take rate, benefited from revenue related to our hedge gains. Volume-based expenses increased 20% in the first quarter to $1.9 billion. Transaction expense represented 96 basis points as a rate of TPV, flat sequentially and versus last year. Transaction loss was 18 basis points as a rate of TPV, also flat sequentially and versus last year. Loan losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. Transaction margin dollars grew 6% to $2.2 billion in the first quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 54%, a decline of approximately 290 basis points versus Q1 \u201818. The credit receivable sale was a meaningful driver of this decline. We expect to see transaction margin dollar growth reaccelerate in Q3. Non-transaction related expenses grew 2% versus last year, growth in these expenses was affected by both the lapping of the held for sale accounting changes, which resulted in a lower rate of growth year-over-year as well as an increase in expenses related to our 2018 acquisitions. Normalizing for both of these, non-transaction related expenses grew 7%. On this adjusted basis, we delivered 280 basis points of operating leverage. Operating income in the first quarter grew 13% to $934 million and our operating margin modestly improved versus last year. Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income would have grown 16% and our operating margin would have expanded 110 basis points in the quarter. Other income in the quarter increased by $185 million, primarily from net unrealized gains on strategic investments. On a per share basis, unrealized gains contributed approximately $0.12 after-tax, $0.04 of the benefit was included in the EPS guidance we provided in January. The incremental $0.08 was not in our guidance and resulted from our investment in MercadoLibre, which closed on March 15th. Going forward, our other income line item will be affected each quarter by movements in MercadoLibre\u2019s stock price. I will discuss this more in moment. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter grew 37% to $0.78. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $9.5 billion. In addition, we generated $809 million of free cash flow and repurchased $750 million of stock. Before discussing guidance for the second quarter and updated guidance for the full year, I would like to provide more color on how we plan to disclose the effect of unrealized gains and losses from strategic investments on our income statement as well as context for the restructuring charge that we recorded in Q1. Our strategic investments create earnings volatility, given that unrealized gains and losses are recognized from observable price movements. As a reminder, as of January 2018, equity investments are required to be mark-to-market when reportable event occurs. Given the difficulty and predicting public market valuation changes when we provide quarterly guidance, we will not be able to estimate the overall EPS impact from our strategic investment portfolio. For the remainder of the year, as soon as practicable following quarter end, we will issue an 8-K providing the net gains or losses and related earnings impact on the entire strategic investment portfolio for the prior quarter. In addition, going forward, to the extent that our guidance includes an expectation of gains or losses related to these investments, we will quantify this estimated impact when we provide that guidance. In the first quarter, we also recorded a $78 million GAAP-only restructuring charge. This charge relates to workforce actions that are intended to better align our teams in support of our key business priorities as well as actions related to the transitioning of our credit and collection operations to Synchrony. As we grow and evolve, we will continue to evaluate our structure, processes and resource allocation for improvement opportunities. We expect to reinvest the majority of the related savings back into our business to drive growth. This charge was previously contemplated by the GAAP guidance we provided in January for the first quarter and the full-year 2019. Now, I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2019 and our guidance for the second quarter. For the full-year 2019, we are raising our earnings outlook and affirming the revenue guidance we previously provided in January. We now expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range -- sorry, non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.94 to $3.01, representing 22% to 24% growth. Our raised earnings guidance incorporates both our core earnings outperformance in the first quarter as well as the unrealized gain we recognized from our investment in MercadoLibre. As a reminder, we expect this investment to create earnings volatility as we move through the year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.34 billion or 12% to 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted for the credit receivable sale, we expect our revenue growth rate to be 19% to 20%. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 to $0.70, representing 16% to 20% growth. Our second quarter EPS guidance includes an estimated benefit from unrealized gains we expect to recognize in the quarter of slightly less than $0.01. To wrap up, our first quarter results set us up well for another year of strong financial performance. I would like to thank all of our employees, our customers and our partners for a great quarter. And with that I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks for the updated Venmo revenue disclosure, pretty impressive growth there in a very short period of time, but I actually want to ask you about eBay. I know you were down 4% on the volume side there in Q1. So, how does that affect your thought process on the full year outlook for eBay volume? And maybe if you can talk a little bit about the impact -- quantifying the impact that eBay had on the first quarter number. And then, we also need to get some more questions about the potential shape of 2020, just given obviously the operating agreement expiring in the middle of next year. And I know it\u2019s clearly too early for actual guidance. But just directionally, should people be thinking about a noticeable declaration in the P&L in the second half of next, or is that not foregone conclusion because of certain offset that you guys still have found to continue development? Dan Schulman : Thanks Jason for the question, we will spend the next 45 minutes answering it. There is a lot in that. So, let me start off and then maybe I will turn it over to John to talk a little bit about some of your -- some parts of your question. The first, I would just say is, look, I expect eBay and PayPal to be close strategic partners for a long time to come. eBay just added PayPal into their intermediated payments. Our mutual customers, whether they be consumers or merchants, basically demand that we work together and that PayPal be there. We\u2019ve got 277 million people now on the platform. And consumers are 54% more likely to buy when a merchants accepts PayPal. So, the eBay sellers know that, they know people abandon if they don\u2019t use PayPal. And so, I think we're going to be close partners on an ongoing basis. And eBay adding PayPal into their intermediated payments I think is net incremental benefit for us as we look forward. On the OA, the operating agreement, goes through July of 2020. And so, today, our eBay TPV is at 9.7%. now under 10%. It's likely to be, if you just extrapolate out, by the end of the operating agreement, somewhere between like 5% to 6% of our overall TPV. And by the end of 2020, as you probably heard Devin talk about, this ends at the end of July 2020, with very rapidly right after that you\u2019re going into a holiday selling season. And so, there aren\u2019t a lot of changes that merchants will do in that interim period to make any major changes. So, by the end of that 2020, you're going to see our TPV well under 5% at that point. And I feel like what we're seeing right now is not really an impact from intermediated payments but really more of an impact from the decline in GMV in the marketplaces of eBay. And so, even with that decline -- they declined from a TPV prospective 700 basis points in the last couple of quarters. Even with that, you're seeing on adjusted basis, our margins would have been up a 110 basis points this quarter. You\u2019re seeing us reaffirm our guidance for revenues. And by the way, our revenue guidance for the year is between 19.5% revenue growth and 20.5% revenue growth, and we just upped our EPS guidance for the year. So, I would say, they are just becoming a much smaller part of PayPal at a more rapid pace, which by the way is great because it\u2019s just a more even decline than we might have expected. And I think we can easily contain that within our guidance. I would also just say, there is nothing we see in eBay\u2019s intermediated payments that gives us any cause for concern, right now. I might even say the opposite of that. I think we feel very well positioned as we go forward. Bill talked about this on the previous call but I\u2019d just reiterate because the trends are still valid. Merchants who use PayPal to list in multiple markets, see a 3 times lift in sales and often pay less in total expenses than they would on eBay when you look at commissions and payments in total. And we're helping small businesses to list in multiple marketplaces with our One Touch activation. And so, that's helping small businesses. And we feel like that's a big part of our responsibility. The other thing I\u2019d point out is our top 20 marketplaces, excluding eBay, drove $90 billion of TPV in the last 12 months, growing at 39%. So, you can see, we are really integrated into these marketplaces. They are growing substantially. We have a big opportunity once the OA expires to work much more closely with couple of major marketplaces around the world that we have prohibited from working with for. And so, we're feeling pretty good about where we sit right now and nothing in the eBay results would change that perspective. John Rainey : I\u2019d just add a couple of things, Jason, to address your question on cross-border as well as the outlook for the back half of the year. First on cross-border. Like a lot of companies that have the global breadth that we do, we are affected by the stronger dollar. And eBay is part of that cross-border activity. I wouldn\u2019t say that they are an outsized portion of that cross-border activity though. So, that does affect our numbers. Secondly, with respect to the outlook for the year, certainly to a certain extent we have to rely on the guidance that eBay provides, and that influences our expectations around our business. And we\u2019ve certainly seen slowing growth there and they are becoming a declining percentage of our business. But at the same point in time we\u2019re demonstrating that we can expand operating margins and grow our revenue on an adjusted basis 20% while observing this decline and in fact observing the dilutive effect from some of the acquisitions that we had in 2018. And we\u2019re able to do that through all of the other portfolio of products that we have, like we talked about the new experience with Instagram, what we're doing with Venmo, and we\u2019re excited about the relationship with MercadoLibre. All of these things and others that we\u2019re working on, enable us to achieve those kind of financial results, while we absorb the declining percentage of eBay business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : I wanted to ask about Venmo. The 40 million Venmo users, that\u2019s an impressive number. I think that\u2019s ahead of the most people\u2019s estimates. But, even the Q1 exit revenue run rate now, $300 million is above our expectations. So, just trying to get a feel where the excess growth is coming from or just give us a sense of the magnitude of the growth. Is it pay with Venmo, debit, instant transfer? And then, secondly, hearing plans to come out with a Venmo credit, maybe you could talk about that as well. Thanks. Bill Ready : This is Bill. Yes, we\u2019re certainly pleased with the monetization of Venmo and the rate at which that\u2019s progressing. And as we talked about before, it\u2019s not really concentrated on any one thing. We\u2019ve got multiple initiatives that are monetizing for Venmo. We got the Venmo debit card, we got pay with Venmo, we got instant transfer. And instant transfer is what we're getting a lot of the discussions. If you go back sort of six months ago, and talked about on the last call that approximately half of monetization is coming from our initiatives in commence outside of instant transfer. So, we feel like there is a really good balance between the multiple initiatives we have there going from the $200 million annual run rate a quarter ago to -- or over $20 million a quarter ago to over $300 million. Now, we feel like it\u2019s great progress but, it\u2019s not really concentrated in any one of those things. And what we're really seeing across the user base is those Venmo users while still growing in number quite rapidly are also deepening their engagement with us and are looking for more and more products from us. So, to your second question on a Venmo credit card, there is nothing we\u2019ve announced cards beyond the Venmo debit card. But, we certainly see great demand for that. And we see great demand across our user base from more and more products from Venmo. And we are engaging with the banking ecosystem in a very broad way across PayPal and Venmo. And so, we're always looking for new ways that we can go deepen engagement with our users as well as work with our bank partners to deliver great services to our users. But to be very clear, there is nothing beyond the Venmo debit card that we're announcing at this moment in time. Dan Schulman : Bryan, if I can add a little bit to what Bill said. One of the reasons why we announced 40 million is really a lot of numbers that we saw flying out there that were inaccurate. And we thought it was important to set the record straight and lot of people talk about downloads and different things. To us, what\u2019s really important is, how many customers do you have, how many engaged customers do you have. And we've seen a tremendous number of new customers coming on board. But, we actually have an increasing engagement curve. In other words, the engagement of Venmo users increased over time, not churn over time. And so, to us, that really demonstrates some of what Bill was just saying that our base truly does want to engage in the service, is looking for more and more functionality from us. And brands are also increasingly seeing the value of that. I think, the Chipotle [ph] example is a really powerful one. Within a week, they hit their campaign objective with over 1 million sign ups. These are pretty impressive numbers. And we see a lot more opportunities to work with brands to engage with their consumers inside the structural fees. John Rainey : I\u2019ll also add that one of the reasons that we\u2019re providing as much information as we are right now on Venmo is because of some of the questions that are out there about our ability to monetize that, which we've never questioned. But, giving you these nuggets of information around revenue growth and active accounts, it's not something we're going to do every quarter. We don't report different aspects of our business that way. But given the importance of the Venmo and the focus of that, we thought that early on, we would give a couple data points to markers out there to better understand the trajectory of Venmo. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : I wanted to build actually on both Jason and Bryan's question with the margin clarification. You beat our forecast in this quarter but with eBay slowing again and across border slowing a little bit. And then just describe Venmo and the opportunities there to invest and monetize et cetera. I'm curious how often are you in delivering on the margin expansion this year, what kind of levers do you have to grow that confidence. And may be just a bigger picture question, does it make sense to expand margins when there is lot of potential, sounds like really shape consumer behavior on here, consumer platforms like Venom et cetera by helping marketing or promotions or what have you, so a big picture question on margins if that makes sense? Dan Schulman : Sure. Tein-tsin, I'll start and others can jump in. Certainly, as we look at this quarter that we're reporting today, we're able to modestly expand operating margins even with absorbing some of the headwinds that were discussed as well as the acquisitions that we brought on last year. But, we're constantly looking at our ability to invest in the business as well as expand margins and we believe that we can do both. We\u2019ve got significant growth opportunities but we're beginning to really demonstrate the scalability of our platform at a low marginal cost. And we demonstrated that by 280 basis points of operating leverage this quarter, but at the same point in time, investing in things like Venmo, investing in other things that we\u2019re doing or organically and still using our free cash flow to go out and augment that with inorganic investments. So, I guess to summarize my answer to your question is, yes, we do believe that we can do both. But at the same time, we are not going to be a prisoner to trying to show operating margin expansion each individual quarter. We're managing this business for the long term. And we will periodically make investments that might cause us to in one quarter, see a decline in operating margin but maybe there is a better growth opportunity. Other quarters that may be the opposite of that. But, we believe over the long term, we can invest in our business to grow it at the rates that we talked about with mid 20% TPV and revenue growth that\u2019s in the high teens and also expand our operating margins. John Rainey : Also remember, I think it's important to point out that operating margin expansion doesn't just come with for instance, expense reduction. As we grow revenues on Venmo, you see that improvement in our margin structure there, and that will continue going forward. And that's really -- that's a great way to grow your margins because you\u2019re growing your revenues. And we see that in other parts of the business as well. And so we think there is a lot of areas where we can still be more efficient, we\u2019re continuing to see that as a company but there are also a lot of areas where we will grow margins, by growing our top line in certain parts of the business as well and filling holes that we had in the income statement. Dan Schulman : One more thing I would add too Tien-tsin is that when we look at some of these below the line benefits that we had and not MercadoLibre but the $0.04 that was contemplated as we gave our guidance and went into the quarter as well as some of the benefit that we had in our fourth quarter results. We very deliberately talked about it, reinvesting in the business. These are -- this is earnings growth. And while one could argue that it's a lesser quality because its below the line, it gives us an opportunity to grow earnings and pour some of that reinvestment back into the business, so that we can grow our core platform in some of the better parts of our business like Venmo. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks so much and congrats on the strong customer metrics, especially. Looking at the 15% growth in net adds in the quarter and the 9% increase in customer engagement, can you talk about what you're seeing in some of these newer cohorts overall in terms of engagement? You touched on that with respect to Venmo, but I\u2019d be curious in terms of what you're seeing for PayPal overall in terms of the new cohorts. Dan Schulman : Thanks David for the question. I'll start off, and I'm sure Bill will add in. So, I\u2019ll just start off by reiterating a little bit what I said on call. This was a very strong quarter for us in net new actives, it was our -- I think our second best quarter ever in net new activities. The majority is driven by core PayPal but a good amount through Venmo as well. And both PayPal and Venmo increased year-over-year as we look at net new actives. And the reason I think both our engagement is up and our net new actives are up are couple of reasons. One, obviously, we\u2019ve got a network effect going on right now that is clearly helpful. Clearly up on the Venmo side of 40 million with a social fee that connects people together, but also when you look at 22 million merchants and 255 million consumers is a little bit of a must-have for both sides of the two-sided platform. I think the product teams have done a great job on improving customer experiences. Whether it be One Touch, P2P enhancements, choice that we put in place, new things that we\u2019re just beginning to see some nice impact from like rewards being on the platform, not only are we seeing increasing engagement as a result of that but we're seeing best churn as a result too. So, net new actives are a combination of top of the funnel and bottom of the funnel, and we're seeing improvements on both sides. Obviously, partnerships are helping us. We've got a lot of partnerships. They're driving a lot of marketing dollars towards us. We think we're at the very beginning. We've met with senior leaders of a ton of the FIs, financial institutions recently they are all looking at driving incremental volume to us because we drive so much incremental transaction volume to them. Obviously, Venmo, as we talked about that, that's going from strength-to-strength. And I am pretty pleased with our global expansion right now, whether it be in India, Japan. We\u2019ve just done some things with EKYC; Brazil, our partnership with Ita\u00fa is really starting to take off. And so, I am feeling pretty good about a wide range of activities here that that are helping to drive both the engagement and the net new actives. Bill Ready : And I would just say, with regard to how the cohorts are performing, we\u2019ve talked about this on prior calls. For the last three years or so, you're seeing a kind of a steady trend line up on increasing the number of net new actives each quarter. And we closely watched the quality of those cohorts, and we\u2019ve seen that each cohorts has gotten better and better and better over time. And that really just speaks to everything Dan was describing in terms of how well-rounded our offerings are. We\u2019ve expanded the range of services we can provide to consumers, the different places that a consumer can engage with us. And so, engagement is up overall and the quality of our cohorts even as we really widened the top of the funnel, so to speak, in terms of getting new users onto the platform, the quality of the cohorts does not only remain strong but we see each successive cohort, being stronger and stronger than the prior cohorts. There is nothing we\u2019ve seen has really changed in that overall trend. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heath Terry : Just to dig into the acceleration in merchant services growth a little bit, now that we\u2019ve seen it for a few quarters. Dan, you've talked us in the past about the leverage that you're seeing, processing payments for companies like Uber and Airbnb and Apple Pay and now you're adding Instagram shopping. How much of these named partners impacting the acceleration and merchant services growth? And particularly something that's relatively early stage, like Instagram shopping. How do you think about the impact that it or may be other partners that we haven't talked about yet are meaningfully contributing to future growth. Dan Schulman : Yes. I think, some of those, as you mentioned, are just starting. So, we're going to see quite a bit of future growth, Instagram shopping would be a good example of that. Another good example Heath that you didn\u2019t mentioned but we think is a really meaningful vertical that we\u2019re just moving into, would be built, like our partnership with Paymentus. We think that there are at a minimum, tens and tens of billions of dollars of incremental TPV to just that vertical, maybe significantly more. So, these partnerships are obviously growing rapidly. We talked about the top 20 generating 90 billion of TPV growing at 39%. And also remember, there are other big marketplaces out there that we\u2019re prohibited from working with because of the operating agreement. And we are honor that operating agreement completely to letter of it in and spirit of it. And so -- but those marketplaces are ready to start partnering with us and we\u2019re ready to start partnering with them on a much deeper basis. I think, you look at partners like Uber and Airbnb and others. We think they\u2019ve got tremendous growth opportunities yet. We\u2019ve been partnering with them for quite some time going forward. And we think being deep strategic partners with some of them is a really important element for both -- for our mutual customers. Bill Ready : I would just say, Dan described, these partnerships are varying stages of maturity, like Uber and Airbnb that we work with from almost inception to newer things like Instagram. But across each of these are seeing PayPal, both the payment market as well as our broader platform to connect to number of commerce experiences, will be coming the preferred platform for the best commerce experiences out there. As Dan cited earlier that our top 20 marketplace and partners outside eBay were $90 billion plus volume over the last 12 months, growing at 39% plus year-on-year. I think this is one of the most important trends in e-commerce right now is that if you are a small to midsize seller or a small seller, a decade ago there was sort of one place you could go to sell. And there has been an explosion of those places. And some of those are newer and more nascent, others of those are more mature. But across those, PayPal is a partner of choice both for those marketplace and partner providers as well as the small, midsize businesses that selling those places that are using PayPal to connect into those many forums. And so that's been a great area of growth for us. And it's -- there is partners of varying phases of maturity. And I think it's great that there is no one of those partners that dominates for us. At the same time, it's -- this trend is well along its path. And we have become a primary partner to the eco system, both in terms of those marketplaces as well that people want to sell within those marketplaces. Dan Schulman : Yes. Just adding 22 million merchants, we talk about our overall 277 million, but 22 million merchants that are growing quite nicely every single quarter as well, being able to take those predominantly small merchants and be able with One Touch authentication, get them into all these marketplaces that Bill just talked about, helps to marketplaces and helps us to deliver incremental sales to those small business partners. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Darrin Peller : Hey, guys. Thanks again. Look, I mean, net new active numbers continues to clearly outperform the 300 million year end expectations, and I know it\u2019s just on this last quarter. But, I kind of want to hone in again on just to make sure these kinds of trends can be sustainable around. If I could Venmo and core, the international side still seems to be something -- an area we think is a big opportunity. And I'd love to hear more about how India is going and then may be the MELI deal. I mean, the commercial agreement to us seems like it could be a big opportunity for something kind of like when you went after as I do is enabling cross border transactions from maybe all of those tons of millions of Latin American users to use international or PayPal accept it. Are we thinking about that right and other international opportunities? And then just maybe also update us on the pipeline of incremental marketplaces, beyond like we saw and Instagram would be great. Thanks so much, guys. Dan Schulman : Let me start off a little bit maybe with how we thought about MercadoLibre, and Bill can talk about maybe the sustainability of the net new actives going forward. So, Darrin, you are exactly right, I mean, we see international as tremendous opportunity space for us. And if I take a step back, we're willing to invest in companies or acquire companies that we believe advance our strategic agenda. I said this in my remarks, we do want to be the leading global digital payments platform. And that means, looking across the world who are the leading players there, and how might we partner together in some way to take our respective platforms, the respective number of customers we each have. MercadoLibre, between their marketplace and part [ph] of their payments infrastructure, 200 million plus customers themselves. And so, you\u2019ve put that together with ours, you have almost 500 million customers. And there to your point, you can see that combination being quite powerful for driving growth for both companies. And so, there are companies like MercadoLibre where a strategic partnership may make a sense for us, and they allow us to expand our presence into geographies or set of capabilities. And by the way there may be other companies around the world that offer similar strategic options for us. And we\u2019d be willing to explore partnerships, very akin to what we did with MercadoLibre. None of our investments, whether it\u2019d be MercadoLibre or others, prevent us from working with anybody else. We are an open platform, we intend to work with everyone in driving this agenda helping consumers and businesses have access to the digital economy. And so, we're very pretty pleased with the overall partnership and relationship we\u2019re developing with MercadoLibre. We do have a Board observer seat, I think it\u2019s going to allow for deep collaboration and maybe our platforms into a commercial relationship, I think will drive a lot of value for us. But again, there are others like this that we see around the world as well. Bill Ready : And on the sustainability of the net new actives, it's really about three years now if you mid-2016 when started to bend the curve on accelerating net new assets. And we\u2019ve gotten this question on sustainability consistently since I think three years in and I think we\u2019re demonstrating that sustainability. And the thing that we\u2019ve talked about throughout that has been that it\u2019s not about any one particular product experience, it\u2019s not about any one particular geography, it\u2019s that we revamped all of our product experience and broaden the set of services that customers engage in across many geographies. And so, the fact that that acceleration and that new actives is not tied to any one particular product experience, not tied to any one particular geography and is well diversified across product experience and across geographies, I think this speaks to the ongoing sustainability that we demonstrated over the last three years. I think further on the marketplaces, you asked about pipeline there but Dan alluded to this earlier, but what we can deliver for those marketplaces, we talk a lot about what we drive in terms of much better conversion for consumers on a front end. If you are a marketplace, the fuel that sees the marketplace oftentimes attracting sellers on the other side of the marketplace. And those $22 million sellers that we have that can be One Touch activation, as Dan was describing earlier, that\u2019s quite significant for those marketplaces because it\u2019s not just that you're taking friction out of the sign-up in terms of having to provide information, those marketplaces are looking for vetted sellers with proven selling history, wanting to understand what vertical those sellers engage in. And all those things that we can do to really bring sellers into this exclusion of new marketplaces out there, really makes us a partner of choice, not only on the consumer buying side but in terms of fueling those marketplaces with proven sellers, it is a tremendous benefit. So, we see really rich pipeline of marketplaces there, both for the infrastructure that we provide with our PayPal for Partners platform as well as what we're able to do to go bring customers and enter those marketplaces both on the consumer side as well as on the merchant side. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks, guys. I appreciate the insight so far. My question is on Synchrony, on the Synchrony relationship. And I was hoping you could update us on how to think of the ongoing growth of the revenue share for the year, consumer lending business. And also if you can clarify maybe the magnitude and timing of the servicing part of that agreement. Is that sort of -- does that end inter quarter in 2Q or does it end at the end of the quarter, how should we think about that? John Rainey : Sure, Ashwin. I will take that. With respect to the agreement, the transition of that, it\u2019s at the end of the June of this quarter. And we will, as we noted in the prepared remarks, we received a payment from Synchrony related to some of the servicing of that. But, we will also, as part of the charge that we announced -- we will have a reduction in workforce related to employees that currently serves that business today. So there will be sort of an offsetting benefit there going forward. In terms of the growth, I think that it\u2019s more in line with the overall business that we\u2019re doing. Credit in general, including merchant credit here as well, as well as the international credit, they tend to be growing little bit faster than the rest of our business because of some of the opportunities that we have there. But all of those numbers are built into our full-year guidance. I think, fortunately for us -- we\u2019ll be happy to get passed past this next quarter where we have to quit making -- where we can quit making adjustments for things like held for sale accounting and then the revenue impact to other value-added services and so forth. But, the second half of the year will be more of an ongoing -- more representative of what the ongoing business will look like. Dan Schulman : Yes. And let me may be add to that. We just had our credit operations review yesterday. And I'm really pleased with what I'm seeing from that team right now. They are really embracing partnership. Synchrony is unleashing our ability to look at all forms of growth on the credit side. There is a ton of new innovative incremental things that they're looking at. Our merchant lending business is right now over $10 billion, since we started. We think we're one of the top lenders of working capital small businesses. So, on every front, I'd say I\u2019m quite pleased with what I'm seeing and what the future falls as a result of what we've done in our partnership with Synchrony. So, I think we'll continue to see good growth on that side. And as John said, we will be glad to get through second quarter, so we don't have to keep adjusting results and you will be able to see that clearly in our revenues. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open. George Mihalos : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick one, maybe going back to Jason\u2019s question around cross-border. I mean, obviously, the volume there of TPV has been under some pressure for the myriad of reasons that you talked about. But now going into 2Q and through the rest of the year, the comparisons ease, FX should be less of a headwind than what we had before. And obviously sort of international opportunities are sort of front and center. Do you think that the volume growth or the TPV growth has slowed there, has bottomed, and is there a reason why that shouldn't really start to accelerate over the back half of the year? Thank you. John Rainey : Hey, George. It\u2019s John. I\u2019ll take this. So, the back half of the year, we do expect an acceleration in cross-border. Q2 will look probably pretty similar to Q1. But, there are two things going on there. One is that we simply have sort of a translation effect, and that corrects itself as we as we lap the previous periods where we saw changes in the relative value of the currencies. But, the second thing is there is a behavioral aspect to cross-border activity that if you live in a country where the currency there has depreciated appreciably versus say the U.S. dollar, it doesn\u2019t -- when you lap that four quarters later, it doesn't all of a sudden make it less expensive to buy something. So, that\u2019s sort of an ongoing pressure. But I'll remind you, that certainly works both ways. We\u2019re in 200 markets across the world and these things ebb and flow. There will be periods where we have headwinds related to this and there will be periods where there are tailwinds. I think, very fortunately for us, given the diversity of our portfolio in the various regions that we operate in around the world, there is sort of a natural hedge that goes on. And relative to I believe Darrin's question earlier around some of the other opportunities, when we think about our growth opportunities and investment opportunities around the globe, this is something that we certainly keep in mind. And if you think about the MercadoLibre investment, Latin America is an area where we\u2019re less strong than we are in other institution. And we will continue to focus our investments around building up our presence in some of these areas where there's more opportunity to grow where we don't have the footprint that we do today. And that enables us to have sort of this natural hedge, if you will, to currency pressures that are going to happen from one period to the next. Dan Schulman : Thanks so much for that. And thanks everybody for joining us today, really appreciate your time. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great afternoon.",

Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Cheri. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the second quarter 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full year 2019, our medium-term outlook and the impact of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, July 24, 2019. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had a solid quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $4.31 billion in revenue, growing 12% year-over-year on an FX-neutral and spot basis, or 19% adjusted for the sale of our consumer credit receivables to Synchrony. For the second quarter, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS, which included a $0.14 gain from our strategic investments, including MercadoLibre, Uber, and others. Non-GAAP EPS grew 47%, and excluding strategic investments grew by 27%. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 200 basis points year-over-year to 23.2%. This represents the largest year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP OI margin since becoming an independent public company four years ago. Another highlight of the quarter was our growth in both net new actives and engagement. We added 9 million net new actives in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. We now have 286 million active accounts on our platform, including 23 million merchants, and we remain on pace to exceed 300 million active accounts by the end of the year. Over the past 12 months, we've added 41 million net new actives, a new record for us. Engagement also continues to consistently improve growing by 9.3% to 39 transactions per active account. Increasing use of our platform helped to drive 172 billion of TPV in the quarter, up 26% on an FX-neutral basis, an increase of approximately 100 basis points from last quarter. Total payment volume, excluding eBay grew 30% on an FX-neutral basis, up 70 basis points from last quarter and outpaced the overall payments market as we continue to gain share. eBay Marketplaces TPV once again declined approximately 4% in the quarter, and now represents just 9% of our overall TPV, down nearly 300 basis points from Q2 last year. We processed approximately 1 billion transactions per month in Q2, up 28% year-over-year. Mobile TPV grew by 37% to more than 73 billion in Q2. One Touch with 149 million consumers and 13 million merchants remains a clear leader in mobile checkout, with nearly two times the conversion of competing wallets, helping merchants of all sizes increase sales in the competitive omni-channel retail environment. One Touch now enables over 80% of the Internet Retailer 100 in the U.S. Venmo continues its significant momentum and is well on its way to becoming a daily part of our consumers' financial lives. Venmo total payment volume increased 70% year-over-year to 24 billion in Q2, and we continue to expect to drive nearly 100 billion in TPV by year-end. Venmo continues to significantly grow its revenues with approximately 15 million Venmo users having engaged in a monetizable transaction. With another quarter of outstanding net new active growth, Venmo continues to offer significant opportunity for merchants to attract a valuable, engaged consumer base. In addition, to adding Fandango, Stitch Fix, 1-800-Flowers, TodayTix and TicketNetwork to our growing list of merchant partners offering Venmo as a way to pay, we continue to enrich the Venmo experience by making it even more engaging and personalized. In the second quarter, we added Bitmojis to the Venmo app allowing users to include a personalized Bitmoji along with the payment notes of their Venmo transactions. As we work to improve the financial health of hundreds of millions of people across the globe, I'm thrilled that we recently expanded Xoom into 32 new send markets throughout Europe. Customers across Europe can now use Xoom to send money, pay bills, or reload phones to more than 130 markets internationally. Launching Xoom's full capabilities globally is an important development for us as our upgraded tech platform increasingly allows us to deploy capabilities across multiple countries as opposed to the country-by-country rollouts we've previously deployed. This quarter, we announced the PayPal commerce platform, a new solution that will help our merchants drive their sales volumes in the digital commerce era. The PayPal commerce platform is designed to meet the specific needs of marketplaces, e-commerce platforms, and crowd-funding sites by bringing together a comprehensive set of technologies, tools, services, and financing solutions for businesses of all sizes. Powered by PayPal's unique two-sided network, the PayPal commerce platform is nearly any business access to a flexible, customizable suite of services that enables global growth, simplifies compliance, provides risk protection, and empowers their end-to-end payment capabilities. Our business financing solutions are another way that we're helping businesses grow and achieve their ambitions. This quarter, we began offering our PayPal business loan product to PayPal merchants in Canada, allowing them to access financing to build and sustain their businesses. This follows the expansion of our business financing solutions to Germany in Q4 2018, in Mexico earlier this year in partnership with Mexican lending platform Konfio. Since launching our business lending solutions, we provided access to more than 10 billion in funding through 650,000 loans and cash advances to more than 0.25 million small businesses around the world. In June, the UK Competition and Markets Authority provided final approval of our acquisition of iZettle. We are now beginning to integrate iZettle's products and themes around the globe, which we expect will significantly strengthen PayPal's in-store presence. Finally, we continue to partner with leading technology platforms and financial institutions to reimagine financial services. We believe that the full potential of FinTech can only be realized through partnerships that leverage the best of our collective assets. In the quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Google to allow businesses to accept PayPal with Google Pay through their apps and websites. This feature is now available in all 24 countries where Google Pay supports PayPal as a payment method. We both solidified and extended our global partnership with Uber, and also announced that we intend to explore future commercial payment collaborations including the development of Uber's digital wallet. As part of this agreement, we invested $500 million in a private placement and we couldn't be more excited about deepening our relationship with this innovative partner, and we are almost complete with our MercadoLibre commercial agreement. This will significantly deepen our strategic relationship and expand our international scope and scale. We expect this will include integration of PayPal into the MercadoLibre marketplace, open our merchant network through our smart payment's button platform to MercadoPago customers and link our respective consumers together for P2P and international remittances. These developments represent significant milestones on our journey to be the worldwide payments platform of choice, helping to enable global commerce by connecting the world's leading marketplaces and payment networks. These are complex multifaceted partnerships and they take multiple quarters to come to fruition. As we've deepened these relationships, we are frequently seeing the opportunity to deploy capabilities well beyond our initial scoping. While the scope expansion has delayed some of our initially planned deployment dates, it bodes well for the ultimate scale of these initiatives. And while these delays have slightly affected our revenue guidance for the year, we remain quite confident that the majority of these will be implemented by year-end. We are also raising our EPS guidance for the year and expanding our operating margin and we are confident in the medium-term targets outlined at our Investor Day last May. We certainly have no shortage of opportunities in front of us and we look forward to shaping an exciting future with our partners, customers and employees. And with that I'll turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us deliver another solid quarter. We had strong performance both financially and operationally. We grew non-GAAP operating income 22% to $998 million and our reporting records for both operating margin and operating margin expansion. We also generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter which grew 40% on a normalized basis. Operationally, trends in our net new active accounts, engagement and TPV remain strong. Our performance demonstrates the consistent strength of our platform and the scalability of our model. Revenue in the second quarter increased 12% on both the spot and currency-neutral basis to $4.31 billion. Adjusting for the sale of U.S. receivables to Synchrony revenue growth was approximately 19%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1.8 points to revenue growth in the quarter. In addition the effect of the stronger dollar net of hedging was a revenue headwind of $35 million. U.S. revenue grew 7% versus Q2, 2018 and approximately 20% adjusting for the credit receivable sell. International revenue grew 18%. On a spot basis transaction revenue grew 17% in the quarter. Revenue from other value-added services decline 21% as a result of the receivable sell. On a normalized basis, it grew approximately 30%. In addition, we recognized $58 million in revenue from Synchrony related to loan servicing and collections. As planned, Synchrony took over these services at the end of June. Going forward, we will no longer benefit from the revenue related to these services. In the second quarter, transaction take rate was 2.25%, compared to Q2 2018, this was a decline of 13 basis points. Strong growth in P2P contributed to approximately half of the decline. Ongoing weakness in eBay's Marketplaces business and pressure from the stronger dollar on a few key cross-border corridors were also responsible for the reduction. Total take rate in Q2 declined 27 basis points from the prior year. Approximately 60% of this decline was attributable to the credit receivable sell. The same factors that affected transaction take rate also contributed to the decline in our total take rate. Both transaction take rate and total take rate benefited by approximately five basis points from revenue related to our hedge gains. Volume-based expenses increased 15% in the second quarter to $1.9 billion. Transaction expense was 94 basis points as a rate of TPV improving four basis points from Q2 2018 and two basis points sequentially. The reduction in transaction expense as a rate was primarily due to the timing of the realization of benefits from volume incentives, which were recognized in the third quarter last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our transaction expense as a rate of TPV to be in the range of 95 basis points to 98 basis points. Transaction loss was 14 basis points as a rate of TPV, a decline of five basis points from Q2 2018 and four basis points sequentially. This reduction in transaction loss was driven by improvements in our risk management capabilities. Loan losses were four basis points as a rate of TPV in line with recent performance. Transaction margin dollars grew 9% to $2.4 billion in the second quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 55%, a decline of approximately 120 basis points versus Q2 2018. Over the past four quarters, the credit receivable sell has been a meaningful driver of the decline in transaction margin dollar growth. We expect growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2019 and be in the range we reported prior to the Synchrony announcement. Non-transaction-related expenses grew 2% versus last year. Growth in these expenses was affected by both the lapping of held-for-sale accounting changes, which resulted in a lower rate of growth year-over-year, as well as an increase in expenses related to our 2018 acquisitions. Normalizing for both non-transaction related expenses grew 6%. On this adjusted basis, we delivered 300 basis points of operating leverage with these expenses increasing only $0.11 for every dollar increase in revenue. This is indicative of our sustained ability to grow at a low marginal costs. Across our business, we're pleased with our operating discipline and cost performance. Our scale continues to afford us leveraged opportunities. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the second quarter grew 22% to $998 million and our operating margin expanded approximately 200 basis points from Q2, 2018. Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income grew 24% and our operating margin expanded 280 basis points in the quarter. Other income in the quarter increased by $201 million, primarily due to a $187 million increase in net unrealized gains on strategic investments. On a per share basis, unrealized gains contributed approximately $0.14 after tax. $0.01 of this benefit was included in the EPS guidance we provided in April. The incremental $0.13 was not in our guidance and resulted predominantly from our investments in MercadoLibre and Uber. Consistent with the plans we discussed on our last earnings call, we disclosed the expected effect of these unrealized gains on our second quarter earnings in our 8-K released on July 9th. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter grew 47% to $0.86. Adjusting for unrealized gains of $0.14 this year and $0.02 last year, non-GAAP EPS grew 27% in the quarter. Our strong EPS results reflect the operational outperformance with solid revenue growth, efficiencies and cost discipline, all contributing in a meaningful way. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $10.7 billion. In addition, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow or approximately $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2019 and our guidance for the third quarter. For the full year 2019, we are raising our earnings outlook and lowering our revenue guidance, which I will speak to in a moment. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 29% to 31% and be in the range of $3.12 to $3.17. Our raised earnings guidance reflects the outperformance of our business in the first half of 2019. It also incorporates the unrealized gains we have recognized from our strategic investment portfolio. As a reminder, these investments may create earnings volatility as we move through the year. Subsequent to quarter end and prior to the release of our earnings, we plan to continue disclosing the effect of these investments on our results. We also expect to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 100 basis points this year, demonstrating our sustained ability to scale our business -- incremental costs. For the full year, we are lowering our revenue outlook to a range of $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion from our prior range of $17.85 billion to $18.1 billion. This new range reflects growth of 14% to 15% for the year, and adjusting for the sale of receivables 18% to 19% growth. Since we last provided guidance in April, a few key factors have contributed to revisions to our forecast. First, as Dan mentioned, we have a few big product integrations with partners that are experiencing delays in part because of their expanded scope. Second, our previous guidance contemplated the implementation of certain price changes that we are now delaying. While the timing has shifted out a few quarters, we still expect to realize the full benefits of our partnership and pricing initiatives. And finally, approximately 20% of our volume is cross-border and affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. We now anticipate that continued strength in the U.S. dollar will have a greater impact on our revenue in the second half of the year than we've previously expected. These changes to our 2019 revenue expectations are primarily related to the timing of initiatives. Our medium-term outlook for revenue and earnings, as provided in May 2018, has not changed. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.38 billion, or 18% to 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.71, representing 20% to 23% growth. Our third quarter EPS guidance includes an estimated $0.03 benefit from unrealized gains we expect to recognize in the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making across many fronts. We are advancing our strategic priorities and at the same time sustainably improving our cost structure. The cash flow generating power of our business continues to give us great flexibility, as we allocate capital with discipline. We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and return to the queue for any follow ups. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. Dan Schulman : Hey, how are you? How's it going? Jason Kupferberg : Good. So just wanted to start with a question on the revised revenue outlook. So we're taking, I guess, about $300 million out and, John, you walk us through three factors driving that. Any way you can kind of give us the relative sizing on those factors. And then, if you could also just elaborate on some of the comments you alluded to about these revenues absolutely being delayed, not lost. Are we interpreting that properly and should we assume that the lion's share of this essentially ends up getting recognized in 2020 or does some of it bleed into 2021? We'd love some more color on that. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Sure, Jason. So without being specific on any one of the three items I've mentioned, I would say that the magnitude of them are in the order that I laid them out; product integration first; pricing second; and then macro FX being third. I think, to address your last point, we expect to realize the full 100% of the benefit from all of these. This is simply a delay in the realization of those benefits until 2020. I'll emphasize that when you're a company our size that is growing at the rate that we are, oftentimes we have to make educated guesses about the time frame of a lot of these launches taking place. Sometimes, we do better than what we expected. Sometimes you get into something and you see scope expansion because of good opportunities or more complexity, and that results in a delay such as the case that we're seeing right now, but we still have a lot of excitement about what these opportunities present for us and do expect to realize the full benefit on a run rate basis. John Rainey : Let me just jump in on this, Jason. Appreciate the question. Yes, this is a matter of when, not if. And when we talk about when, we're talking about the next several quarters. And so for us, we feel like we had strong operational performance in the quarter. If you look at our net new actives, those were up by 17%. If you look at our engagement, again up by 9% plus. You look at just little things that actually matter a lot like our risk improvements that we've put into place, part of that is the result of acquisitions that we've done with Simility that's lowering our risks and helping our losses. These are all very sustainable types of things, and that, while the revenue is delayed, it's certainly not lost. In fact we're confident all of that revenue will come in. The margin improvements are more permanent. And because we're just seeing those, this isn't taking away expenses from one thing to improve margins. These are sustainable margin improvements based on either better experiences that we're putting out or just better capabilities that we now have in the business. So I would say, we feel really good as we look forward on this. It's unfortunate that some of these are slightly delayed, but I'll give you an example. One of these that were delayed was Paymentus. Paymentus is an extremely large strategic partner of ours. It is a brand-new vertical and we're putting into our stack. It involves integrating all of their multiple pillars into our platform, involves integrating them into our app, and is a massive partnership for us. It's going to take a little bit longer than we thought, but everything we hoped for is there and actually more. So it's just a good example. We probably underestimated the amount of work it would take to go and do that, and there is also as John mentioned, a lot of scope expansion that occurred. But it's a great partnership and we'll have other bill payment players that will join as well. And so, this is a matter of revenues being delayed not lost, and we're trying to do this in a way that assures that when we do implement whether its partnerships or pricing changes, they're done in a world-class manner. And so, I don't want to jam something in, in the quarter. I want to make sure that we're building the right sustainable long-term things for this business. And if we've got to delay something a quarter or two, so be it to make sure that we do this the right way. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask on margin again. It looks like you be able to take the bottom line hereby showing a little more operating leverage against the lower revenue outlook. So what levers exactly are you pulling to make this happen? Are you sacrificing growth investments to do it? And I guess very importantly here for a lot of us, do you have more margin levers available to you in the event revenue continues to face delays? Thanks. John Rainey : Hey Tien-Tsin, thanks for the questions. I'll start and Dan may want to add a couple of things, but let me start with the headline that we are not turning away growth opportunities to achieve the leverage and the operating margin expansion that we have in business. We believe that, we've got significant opportunities. And we've talked a lot about these in the past, things like what we're doing around customer service for example, how we're driving the contact rate down, how we're actually lowering the cost of that service. Even the very way that we develop product, we're becoming more efficient at. And then, you have to also remember over the last four years, we were propping up an independent public company, and that requires investment in things like compliance and a lot of the back-office functions. And so those are largely behind us. And so what you're beginning to see right now is the realization of those economies of scale. And that said, I think fundamentally the main point here, but there's also an added point that I would point to this quarter, which is slightly different than what you've seen in some of the more recent quarters, and that's what we've done in our volume-based expenses. So if you look at both transaction expense and transaction losses, they appreciably declined as a rate of TPV from the prior quarters. Now, I called out the reasoning for the transaction expense decline, and that's certainly more of a transitory nature and sort of a timing impact on that, but transaction losses is one that has the potential to become more permanent. Now one quarter does not make a trend, so I don't want to call this out as what we should expect going forward, but this was truly based upon improved modeling and capabilities that we have in our fraud detection and risk management. And so, we're very encouraged about that. And as we begin to \u2013 or we continue to refine those models over time, hopefully that type of decrease in the rate of losses for TPV is something that can become more sustainable for us. Dan Schulman : Yeah. I'd just add on top of that. When I look at like for instance our Q2 revenues. We're right in the range that we predicted. And we would have been at the high-end of the range were it not for some of these FX headwinds. And as everyone on the call knows, FX headwinds can be against you one quarter and with you another quarter and that's why we give a range on that. Even with that, we still grew our revenues by 19%, on a normalized basis, EPS was up 27%, and we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow. But most important to me the operational metrics that we really look at whether it be net new actives, whether it be engagement, whether it be TPV were all close to records for us. Like MS, TPV excluding Marketplaces or eBay was up 30.2%. I think that's like in the last six quarters is like at a high before that or type for high in the last six quarters. So when I think about our revenues, and I think about our operating metrics what the drivers of those are, they're all really quite strong. Yes, there are delays in some of these key partnerships and these key partnerships will drive a lot of revenue, but those key partnerships will happen. We're well underway. We understand exactly what the critical path is going forward on that, and the pricing as well. We have pricing. It's both up and down, but when we put pricing out there, I want to make sure that it's transparent, it's easy to be understood and we have all of our processes in place to support any pricing changes that we might make and just be sure we execute in a world-class manner. So I think not only do I think the margin improvements are sustainable, and as John mentioned, potentially there are quite a bit more to be found, but there are drivers of our revenue are quite strong and I anticipate those to stay that way. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yeah. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Hey thanks guys. Look when considering the medium-term outlook, it obviously looks like from at least the revenue side does sound like it's short-term in nature from what you're saying. But the drivers as you just mentioned, Dan are very strong. In fact I think they're better than what your medium-term typical guide suggests around, whether it's TPV or net active growth or even engagement levels. I guess first of all, just -- can you just reiterate if you can still see the same sustainability to that that those drivers you've been seeing? What gives you the confidence you can see that in the next year or two? And then I guess just to follow-up on the partnerships, I mean it sounds like some of these are pretty material in terms of opportunities. So not only net new active growth and the drivers exactly in terms of the revenue flow-through, could that cause a pretty big reacceleration in 2020? Dan Schulman : Yeah. So I do believe that the drivers of the business are not just sustainable, but we've got the potential to do better. I mean, we've got continued strong growth in our net new actives, 41 million over the last 12 months, nine million this quarter, up 17%. The 286 million active we have, that's up 17% year-over-year, and 23 million merchants on the platform, adding almost one million merchants a quarter right now. So -- and you're seeing both PayPal and Venmo accelerate versus last year. And I talk a little bit about them on a second to your -- like your revenue review point. But look you've got, obviously, a network effect that's really kicking in right now. If you're a merchant, we have so many consumers that want to use PayPal or Venmo now as a way to pay. They almost have to be a part of the network and the same thing from a consumer perspective. We've got merchants everywhere that are accepting us. And so that network effect is continuing to kick in. Very importantly though most people think about net new actives as the top of the funnel, but when you have a base as large as ours, the churn rate is just as important and all the improved customer experiences that we've done from choice to additional Venmo monetization efforts to P2P flows, to our new revised app those are all reducing our churns and making a big difference in the number of net new actives. We've got global expansion that's happening. We're at the tip of that iceberg in global expansion for us. Obviously, we're getting more net new actives from Brazil, from India, from Japan but we're just beginning in those markets. And a partnerships like the ones we're going to do with MercadoLibre, ones that we're going to do with Uber are yet to kick in. We're still -- we just rolled out Xoom expansion to 32 new send markets. We've got other international markets that we're planning to enter into. And so, I see net new actives as sustainable and maybe even being better than where we are. And engagement, the same thing is happening. It's just improving. I'll give you an example of that. And this is a really -- it's quite a positive thing in numerous ways. The new net actives that are coming in on Venmo have more engagement than previous net new actives and that new engagement is around the monetizable services. Because that's what they're coming into. They're coming into a value proposition that has all of that, so they're aware of it and they're using it more and more. And so, you've got increased engagement, increased monetization efforts and increased revenue. I mean, on the Venmo side, we're seeing really nice quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are well exceeding, not just our budget on Venmo, but our most recent forecast on Venmo revenues. And I really couldn't be more pleased with the efforts that that team is doing, with incremental monetization efforts still to come later this year. John Rainey : Darrin, I would just add a couple of points, I think, to emphasize some of the items that Dan spoke to, but when you ask, like, what gives us confidence in our medium-term outlook, I put it in three categories. The first is that, our business is performing very well. If you take our quarterly results, growing revenue 19%, another quarter of 9 million net new actives, expanding operating margin to 200 basis points, the type of cost performance that our core business is performing well. The second, as Dan mentioned, is that one of the best indicators about the future of our businesses is the new cohorts of customers that we're bringing on. And we are seeing those cohorts be more engaged in the previous cohorts. And the third category, I would put broadly into just the opportunity set that we have. So when you look at things like the partnership with Paymentus or Facebook, or what we're doing in Venmo, what we're doing from a product development standpoint around reward points and card recovery, all these opportunities and more that we haven't listed, give us a lot of conviction about our ability to continue to deliver on that medium-term guidance. Dan Schulman : Yeah. And to your point, Darrin, when you think about something like Paymentus and what the revenue opportunity is there, it is quite significant, because we're entering into a brand-new vertical. And when we're entering into a brand-new vertical, it's a lot of work to get it done, but the reward is quite large and commensurate with that work as well. Darrin Peller : All right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys. Dan Schulman : Yeah. Thank you, Darrin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Just want to follow up on the pricing changes that are now delayed. I guess, where were the pricing changes delayed and why? And then, when does it get implemented now? John Rainey : Hi, Bryan, I'll start with that. This is John. We made some changes to our user agreement that allowed us the ability to make certain pricing changes. And I would emphasize that, I think, sometimes the knee-jerk reaction is to assume that all price changes are up. Sometimes we can decrease prices to go after more volume. So we haven't been real specific about what those are, but when we implement a price change, we always want to have that associated with a value proposition to the customer. And when we took a step back and we looked at the effort to improve some of those customer experiences around those price changes, it was more complex than what we imagined, and we want to be measured as we roll this out. We \u2013 I think a theme that you'll continue to hear from us is like we are trying to build a great company over the long-term and we're not going to be so rigid and pushing products out to market, or otherwise that we do something that is not to the standard that, we hold ourselves to. And so generally that's \u2013 that's how we're thinking about some of these pricing changes. We would expect though to go forward with these price changes and perhaps others, either at the tail end of this year, or early 2020 and realize the benefit from them. Dan Schulman : Yeah. I'd just add on to John's comments, because I think we're right on. Look, pricing is like an ongoing journey for us. We're always assessing better maybe more transparent ways to serve our customers. We are always looking at the market dynamics out there, evolving practices of our competitors, and then we look at the value we provide and we try to price appropriately based on those factors. And as John said, we're absolutely determined to be sure that anything we put out into the market that the experience is a great one. So understand both transparent. We've got all the support necessary for it, and we'll make sure that happens. But as John said, we do anticipate all of these go into effect over the next several quarters. Bryan Keane : Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Dan Schulman : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thanks so much. You highlighted that Venmo was exceeding your revenue growth forecast. Can you give us some color on where you stand with the biggest drivers in terms of monetizable experiences whether it be instant withdrawal Venmo debit card or a Pay with Venmo with merchants? John Rainey : Sure, David. I'll take that. There's a \u2013 if you look at the composition of the various ways that we can monetize Venmo. It hasn't changed that much from previous quarters, to date still instant withdrawal is the largest contributor of monetization for us, and then the other half roughly is split between Venmo card and Pay with Venmo. We do expect those to change over time as we've said previously to where ultimately pay with Venmo will be the largest contributor of how we monetize Venmo. So in terms of the progress there, I would say that, when we look at all of the initiatives that we've implemented this year, or have made progress on this year. This is one probably that stands out as performing better than what we initially expected going into the year. I don't want you to misread my comments. I don't think it's appreciably different from what we talked about, but certainly better than what our initial expectations are. So we're still very pleased about the progress that we're making there and it's well on track with our expectations. David Togut : Thank you. John Rainey : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you. As we think about the string of deals that you announced back in the spring with Uber, MercadoLibre, Facebook, even iZettle's clearance, is there a benefit to the 2019 revenue expectations or guidance from those deals? Or maybe just more broadly when and to what degree do you expect to begin to see an impact from that spring of deals? Dan Schulman : Yes. So I'll start off and then maybe John will talk. I think we'll talk a little bit more about next year on our next call. But overall, those are two relationships that we would do time and time again. MercadoLibre is going to significantly enhance our international scale and scope. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity as we integrate our two networks together. If you think about it just in big generic terms, we'll have some 500 million people on our combined network together. MercadoPago customers will now be able to access PayPal merchants around the world. PayPal consumers will be able to buy from MercadoLibre marketplaces merchants. And we're very excited about the potential of linking wallet to wallet on international remittances, as well. And so we see a tremendous amount of learning we'll get from each other and a tremendous amount of incremental opportunity as a result of that. Uber, we already had a very strong relationship, but this not only solidifies that relationship, but we're in deep conversations with them on how to expand the extent of our partnership and to help them drive growth and experiences that they want for their customers and our mutual subscribers. And so that is really quite a bit of an everyday use case for us. We think that will help on both engagement metrics for us both on the Venmo and the PayPal site. These other partnerships that we have certainly going to add to our volumes and our capabilities, we have a lot of high hopes for what bill pay can do. It's obviously a huge vertical. We\u2019ve had numerous people talk to us about it. Our customers are clamoring for it. We'll do full-step processing around that as well. So it will drive quite a bit of incremental volume and revenues for us. As John has mentioned numerous times, partnerships like Facebook take time to develop and to move forward. Facebook like us wants to assure that they have the right experience, but when you look at the volumes that can be driven there, we'll be measured and how we think about it as we look at next year, but we're excited about that potential. John Rainey : If I may add just one thing, as it relates to capital allocation some of the acquisitions that we've already made. And so, I think sometimes what is overlooked is the opportunity for a compounding effect with multiple of these acquisitions. And so I'll give you two examples. The first are the acquisitions of Hyperwallet and Simility which provide capabilities like payouts and risk-as-a-service. That enables us to provide a more comprehensive suite of services and a new product rollout like PayPal Commerce Platform, very important to that. Second example would be something like iZettle. So, I think, it's generally acknowledged that Latin America is an area that we are less strong. Certainly, that influenced our strategic investment in MELI, but iZettle has a presence in Latin America. And so, we can build upon these complementary capabilities from, either the partnerships or acquisitions that we've taken to strengthen our presence in some of these geographies where we are less strong today. Heath Terry : Great, Dan and John, really appreciate that. Dan Schulman : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good evening, guys. Maybe bridging from that last question actually, can you give an update on your M&A plans, given it has now been over a year since Simility and Hyperwallet? Should we be thinking that additional acquisitions are imminent? Or is that part of your strategy, sort of, a back burner given the number of -- and the scope of these partnerships that you're working on? Also, I guess, I'll tuck-in there, given the three mega mergers elsewhere in the ecosystem, are you still exclusively focused on tuck-ins? Or are you sort of rethinking the possibility of potentially larger-scale deals? Thank you. Dan Schulman : Any other questions you want to ask? Those are all good questions. So, look, I'll just say that, from an M&A perspective, I think, in general we're pretty well positioned. We've got a ton of internal innovation rate that is going on. Our toolsets for our engineers, the productivity improvements are dramatic there. And so, we're seeing more and more releases, more and more experiences that we can put out. We obviously have a lot of strong partnerships and a lot of capabilities that we can digest from those partnerships as well. John mentioned it, but obviously our balance sheet is only getting stronger with $10.7 billion of cash-like assets on that. We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow. We still are consistent in that, we're looking to do anywhere between $1 billion and $3 billion of a tuck-in type of acquisitions that help us either from a time-to-market perspective or geographic expansion, or things that get scale and scope through things like partnerships. So, we look at hundreds of potential acquisitions every single quarter. I think you can expect us to be acquisitive going forward. That will be a part of who we are on an ongoing basis. I don't -- as I think about these consolidation in the merchant acquiring space, we're partners with all of those combined entities. I think there is a rational why they needed to do that as online and off-line started to blur, as some needed feet on the streets, others needed online acquiring capabilities. I would say those mergers in and of themselves don't make me feel like there's a need to do a larger acquisition, but we've never ruled out larger acquisitions. They just need a clear a very high strategic fit and hurdle for us, but we look at the potential for acquisitions from smaller to larger and we'll continue to do so. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yep. You bet. Lisa Ellis : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one final question from George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Hey, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Maybe just building on that capital allocation theme, I think John you guys didn't buyback any stock this quarter. How are you thinking about the buyback going forward relative to some of the other capital allocation priorities M&A and like? John Rainey : Sure, George. It's good to speak with you. So, if you go back to May of last year, where we laid out our capital allocation priorities they still remain the same. And that's over that medium-term time frame of the next call it three to five years. We expect that approximately 40% to 50% of our free cash flow will be used to return to shareholders and that we will spend on average about $1 billion to $3 billion, a year with acquisitions and strategic investments. Now, as I'm sure, you appreciate that \u2013 we're going to be optimistic from one quarter to the next. And sometimes, there are competing priorities in a quarter. And also times, it's worth noting that, because of things we maybe working on, we maybe subject to blackout dates as well, in terms of when we can go buy back stocks. So I would discourage you from reading too much into the fact that, we didn't buy back stock. We still intend to buy back the amount that we've talked about. But again, we \u2013 I think we have the sort of the fortunate position to be opportunistic given the opportunity set that's out there in the industry, and so we'll kind of bounce around from one quarter to the next with how we allocate capital, but over that medium term, we'll stick to those tenants that we've provided. Dan Schulman : Thanks very much George for that question. And thank you everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program. You may now all disconnect, and everyone have a great afternoon.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings conference call for third quarter 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, our preliminary outlook for 2020, our medium-term outlook and the impact of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, October 23, 2019. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle and thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong quarter across all of our key metrics. Revenues grew by 19% on an FX-neutral and spot basis to $4.38 billion. Our revenue growth was driven by strong transaction and TPV volumes. For the first time ever, we processed over 1 billion transactions per month in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year to 3.1 billion transactions. TPV growth accelerated 80 basis points from last quarter and was up 27% on an FX-neutral basis to $179 billion. TPV excluding eBay grew by 31%, up 240 basis points from Q3 2018. EBay TPV declined by 3% and now represents just 8% of our total TPV, down approximately 300 basis points from Q3 last year. As of now, our best estimate is that eBay will be approximately 6% of our total TPV at the end of the operating agreement in July 2020. Excluding unrealized losses associated discretely with our investments in MercadoLibre and Uber, we delivered a very strong $0.79 of non-GAAP EPS as compared to our guidance on a similar basis of $0.69 to $0.71. Excluding the mark-to-market changes in our strategic investment portfolio, our non-GAAP EPS grew 31% driven by a year-over-year expansion of more than 200 basis points in our non-GAAP operating margin to 23.4%. I\u2019m very pleased with the leverage of our operating model and the continued expansion of our operating margins. This leverage drove our largest ever quarterly EPS over performance versus our expectations and provides us with increased confidence in our medium-term guidance of 20% EPS growth compounded annually. I\u2019m also very pleased to report strong growth in both net new actives and engagement. We added 9.8 million net new actives in the quarter, a record number for any previous Q3. We now have 295 million active accounts on our platform, up 16% year-over-year including over 23 million merchants. We anticipate ending the year at approximately 304 million active accounts above our stated target of 300 million. Engagement continues to consistently increase, growing by 9% to almost 40 transactions per active account. Mobile is a major driver of our growth with One Touch at 172 million consumers and 13.8 million merchants. We are quite focused on growing our value proposition beyond checkout as our consumers look for more reasons to use PayPal as part of their everyday financial life. I\u2019m quite pleased by the efforts of the PayPal team this quarter and I\u2019m encouraged by the strength of our business fundamentals. We are focused on executing against our strategic priorities. We\u2019ve made significant progress in driving forward our pricing initiatives as well as our product integration with Paymentus and we now anticipate live full stack integration by year-end. Venmo continues to be an incredibly powerful platform for engaging consumers. We processed more than $27 billion in volume for the quarter, growing 64%. That\u2019s almost $300 million in payments per day and an annual run rate that now exceeds $100 billion. The Venmo team has made tremendous strides in enhancing the use cases of Venmo including a recently signed deal with Synchrony to provide a Venmo credit card. All of this is producing very strong monetization results. We ended Q3 with Venmo just shy of a $400 million annual revenue run rate. Last year, we acquired Hyperwallet knowing that payouts are a powerful tool for fueling engagement as retailers and marketplaces look for new ways to interact with their customers. One year later, I\u2019m pleased to report that our payouts capabilities are gaining strong traction among leading brands. In the quarter, Travelers Insurance announced customers can now receive insurance claim payments via PayPal. PepsiCo launched its first ever cash back loyalty program powered by Venmo and PayPal. Lime, the global scooter rental platform selected PayPal to facilitate payouts to its network of freelancers. And Epic Games is now using our capabilities for competitive Fortnite players to expedite their prize payout process. This month we added Venmo as a payout option providing merchants with another powerful way to reach Venmo\u2019s highly engaged user base. Credit continues to be another strong driver of engagement on our platform. This quarter, we launched new consumer installment plans in the United States and Germany, which allow PayPal customers to pay for their purchases with easy to understand monthly payments. This capability is already leading to incremental sales for our merchants. And we signed a long-term strategic partnership agreement with Citi Australia to develop consumer credit products for PayPal\u2019s customers in Australia. We continue to gain strong adoption among merchants around the world in daily spend categories. In the quarter, we further expanded our relationship with Walmart, launching PayPal Checkout as the sole payment solution for its online grocery business in Mexico. In Japan, PayPal is one of the official partners for the Japanese government\u2019s initiative to promote cashless payments throughout the country. We made significant strides this quarter with multiple strategic partners to create better experiences for our shared customers. With American Express, we\u2019ve launched a feature where Amex card members can split a purchase in the Amex app via PayPal or Venmo. We now offer account linking on mobile devices with Capital One and PNC Bank in the United States. We launched instant transfer to bank accounts for Venmo customers through our partnership with JPMorgan Chase and we\u2019ve launched cashback programs with both Chase and Discover. I\u2019m pleased that we are beginning to see increasing traction with the results of our pay with rewards initiative. To date, six million consumers are enabled to use eligible rewards points to pay for a purchase. And those customers who are using their rewards currency currently do so nearly 10% of the time and we are seeing increased engagement and spend as a result. In September, we announced that the People\u2019s Bank of China has approved our acquisition of a 70% equity interest in GoPay, a license provider of online payment services. We are honored to become the first non-Chinese payments company to be licensed to provide online payment services in China. This is a very significant development for us and it has the potential to dramatically expand our total addressable market and our long-term growth prospects. The license enables us to expand upon our relationships with existing partners like China Union Pay and AliExpress and forge new partnerships with China\u2019s financial institutions and technology platforms, allowing us to provide a comprehensive set of differentiated payment solutions to businesses and consumers in China and globally. Our initial focus will be on providing cross-border payment solutions to China\u2019s merchants and consumers, linking China\u2019s commerce ecosystem to PayPal\u2019s vast two-sided network. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. We will share much more about our plans early next year, but sufficed to say, we are very excited about our growth opportunities as a result of this landmark agreement. Q3 was an important quarter for us and our results demonstrate the strength of our expanding two-sided network. More importantly, I\u2019m optimistic about the opportunities in front of us and our ability to shape the financial services landscape. I\u2019ve been leading the PayPal team for the past five years and I\u2019ve never seen it more united, focused and excited about our future. We think the next five years will be as defining and value creating as the past five. And with that, let me turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us deliver a great quarter. The strong results we are reporting today demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our volume growth accelerated to 27%. Our revenue grew 19%. We delivered more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. And we realized operating leverage across each of our non-transaction related expenses. Excluding the effect of unrealized losses from our strategic investment portfolio, which I will discuss later, non-GAAP EPS grew 31%. Our Q3 performance shows the consistent strength of our platform and the scalability of our business. Revenue in the third quarter increased 19% on both the spot and currency-neutral basis to $4.38 billion. Hyperwallet and iZettle contributed approximately 1.9 points to revenue growth versus the third quarter of 2018, U.S. revenue grew 19% and international revenue grew 20% on a currency-neutral basis. On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 18%, accelerating a point from last year in the second quarter of this year. Revenue from other value-added services grew 24%. In the third quarter, transaction take rate was 2.21% and total take rate was 2.45% compared to Q3 2018. This was a decline of 12 basis points and 13 basis points respectively. Continued strength in P2P contributed to approximately half of the decline for both transaction and total take rate. The performance of eBay's Marketplaces business and the headwinds from the stronger dollar also contributed to the reduction in take rate. $70 million in revenue from hedge gains benefited both transaction take rate and total take rate by approximately 3 basis points. Volume-based expenses increased 23% in the third quarter to $2 billion. Transaction expense was 95 basis points as a rate of TPV, improving 1 basis point from Q3 2018. Transaction loss was 14 basis points as a rate of TPV, an improvement of 4 basis points from Q3 2018 and flat to last quarter. This level of transaction loss as a rate of TPV maxed the lowest we've ever achieved and we realized this result while accelerating TPV growth. This reduction in transaction loss was driven by continued improvements in our risk management capabilities. Loan losses were 5 basis points as a rate of TPV, which represents an increase of 2 basis points from Q3 last year. This increase was due primarily to growth in both our merchant and international consumer loan portfolios. Transaction margin dollars grew 16% to $2.3 billion in the third quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 53.4%, a decline of approximately 150 basis points versus Q3 2018. Non-transaction related expenses grew 6% versus last year. Normalizing for cost related to our 2018 acquisitions, these expenses grew 1.9% or $0.04 for every dollar increase in revenue. This performance highlights the scalability of our model, our operating discipline and our ability to grow at a low marginal cost. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the third quarter grew 30% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time. In addition, our operating margin expanded more than 200 basis points from Q3 2018. We delivered leverage across each of our non-transaction related expenses. Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income grew 31% and our operating margin expanded 250 basis points in the quarter. Other income in the quarter declined by $256 million relative to Q3 2018, primarily due to $228 million net unrealized loss on our strategic investment portfolio. On a per share basis, these unrealized losses negatively affected our results by approximately $0.15 after-tax. When we guided Q3 2019 EPS in July, we included an expected benefit of $0.03 related to a funding round for Toss, a privately held company in which we have an equity investment. A few weeks later this funding round closed and as expected, we recognized a $0.03 per share benefit to GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. In addition, in the quarter, our strategic equity investments in Uber and MercadoLibre resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately $0.18 per share. Consistent with the plans we discussed in April on our first quarter earnings call, we disclosed the expected effect of these net unrealized losses for the third quarter in our 8-K released on October 8. Since January 2018, certain equity investments are required to be revalued based on observable price movements. This new standard had a relatively minor impact on our results in 2018. This year, however, our strategic investments in MercadoLibre and Uber have created more earnings volatility. Starting in 2020, we will update our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of these gains and losses on our strategic investments as we believe this will provide a better understanding of our operating performance and a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods. In the third quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.1% versus 16.4% last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized losses from our strategic investment portfolio, our tax rate would have been 13.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate also benefited from a favorable geographic mix of pretax income. Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter grew 5% to $0.61. Adjusting for unrealized losses of $0.15 this year, non-GAAP EPS grew 31% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.2 billion. In addition, we generated $923 million of free cash flow or approximately $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Normalizing for the proceeds, we received from selling our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio last year, free cash flow grew 20%. During the quarter, we returned $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition in Q3, we also access the public debt markets for the first time, raising $5 billion in gross proceeds. The senior fixed rate notes are trenched in three, five, seven and 10 year terms. The average life of this debt is 6.6 years with a weighted average interest rate of 2.56%. We use a portion of the proceeds to repay our outstanding borrowings on our 364 day credit facility and plan to use the remainder of the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation priorities. I\u2019d now like to discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year, as well as our preliminary thoughts for 2020. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.89 billion to $4.95 billion or 17% to 18% growth on a currency neutral basis. In the fourth quarter for the first time, we\u2019re lapping the acquisitions of both iZettle and Hyperwallet. Last year, as we disclosed when we reported Q4 2018 results, these acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5 points of growth. Relative to when we provided guidance in July, the U.S. dollar strengthened. We estimate this headwind to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter. Both our integration with Paymentus and the pricing initiatives that we discussed last quarter are on track and we expect to be substantially complete by the early part of next year. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.83, representing 18% to 21% growth. Our guidance includes no expectation of any gains or losses on our strategic investment portfolio. As a result, for the full year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $17.7 billion to $17.76 billion or approximately 15% growth on a currency neutral basis. Normalizing for the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, the implied revenue growth rate would be approximately 18.5% for the full year. We now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.08, representing 26% to 27% growth, excluding the net unrealized gains year-to-date of $0.11 from our strategic investment portfolio. This guidance implies non-GAAP earnings growth of 25% to 26% for the year, which represents a raise in our EPS outlook. In addition, given the strong free cash flow we generated year-to-date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year to be approximately $3.5 billion. I\u2019d now like to provide an initial framework for how we\u2019re thinking about 2020. As a reminder, our medium-term outlook calls for 17% to 18% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis compounded annually, which includes approximately 1.5 points of revenue growth each year on average from acquisitions. We\u2019re very pleased with the strength of our business and expect our core trends to continue. Our current expectation is that revenue will grow 17% organically on a currency neutral basis next year, without the effect of any acquisitions. 2020 also has two dynamics, I\u2019d like to discuss. First, our operating agreement with eBay expires in July and we estimate that this transition will impact revenue growth by approximately 1 point next year. Second, we will be lapping the contributions to revenue in 2019 from our acquisitions of Hyperwallet and iZettle, which we expect to be an additional point of headwind. Together, these factors pressure revenue growth by approximately 2 points in 2020. Even with this, the strength of our core business provides us with the ability to grow revenue in the range contemplated in our medium-term guidance. Our initial 2020 framework also calls for at least 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. Next year, we\u2019re accelerating our investment in several key initiatives to drive long-term growth and strengthen our platform. At the same time, our ongoing focus on efficiency and natural leverage opportunities will allow us to sustainably deliver operating margin expansion. We expect a portion of this operating leverage to be offset by below the line items, including additional interest expense on a recent debt issuance and lower interest income earned on corporate cash. As a result, our initial outlook is for approximately 17% to 18% growth on non-GAAP EPS in 2020. It is important to note, we are confident that we will grow non-GAAP EPS by approximately 20% compounded annually over the medium-term, consistent with our previous guidance. The strength, diversification and durability of our business give us confidence in our medium-term outlook. In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth and generate significant free cash flow, while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities. We\u2019re focused on creating value for our customers and shareholders and strengthening our position as the world\u2019s leading digital payments platform. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much. A nice acceleration here, especially in the U.S. It looks like revenue up 19%, so just curious, I know that you have eBay drag, you have some pricing that\u2019s coming up here in the fourth quarter. So maybe can you help us unpack the drivers this quarter for the 19% or overall with the acceleration, just curious how sustainable this is given some of the puts and takes that we\u2019re all expecting here? Thanks. Dan Schulman : So maybe I\u2019ll start off with that and then turn it over to John. We\u2019re quite pleased with the revenue growth that we had in the third quarter and really what we expect in fourth quarter and going into 2020. So there are a couple of things, and you\u2019re right, these are before pricing initiatives really come to play as well as our full integration with Paymentus. Our net new actives and our engagement are really beginning to kick in and start to drive incremental growth in our revenues. We had records in net new actives for the quarter, almost 10 million. You\u2019ve got engagement going up again by another 9% to 40 times a year. Just those couple of things are really starting to put more and more acceleration in. And what we\u2019re beginning to see right now is that sales into our back book and a lot of sales into the front book are coming in much more strong than we\u2019ve ever had before. We\u2019re just winning more business right now. There is a bit of a network effect going on. We have most 300 million active accounts now. Merchants understand the scale we have. They want to be a part of that. We do start to see right now the beginnings of our capabilities of selling as a platform provider and not just a product. So as I mentioned with payouts in my earnings script, we\u2019re seeing that really start to take hold. We\u2019re really starting to see a lot more full stack processing start to take hold. And so we\u2019re having a lot more incremental product sales both in the back book as well as in the front book including just basic things like presentment of the PayPal button where it\u2019s presented. Given the scale we have now, merchants are putting us into more and more prime positions at presentment. Partnerships are beginning to kick in right now. We now have nine out of the top 10 U.S. banks working with us. The marketplaces outside of eBay, they have over $100 billion of TPV right now growing at 36% with us. And so we\u2019re really beginning to see a bend in the curve in our core organic PayPal growth and that is really encouraging for us. And then of course, yes, Venmo rapidly growing its monetization efforts right now. We\u2019re really pleased with that. And I think what we\u2019re equally as pleased with is we see a lot of good runway in front of Venmo as well. John Rainey : I would just add. As Dan suggested, we\u2019re seeing good trends across many aspects of our business. I think it\u2019s important to remember for the first part of this year, at least the first three quarters we\u2019ve had some more difficult comps with things like cross-border with some currency effects and things like that. And so we are sort of lapping some of the beginning impacts of that, not that I think the currency environment seems to be getting much improved from where it was. But with respect to the couple of things that you alluded to around Paymentus and pricing, we are live with both of those. There is a metered ramp on each of them. So we\u2019ve launched in three countries on the pricing initiative that we\u2019ve referred to previously. And not to overly fixate on that, because we make pricing changes all the time, but I know there were some questions about that given our last call. And Paymentus, we\u2019re excited about the progress that we\u2019re making there. We\u2019re ramping up in the fourth quarter. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect to be complete with each of those by the early part of next year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys. Solid results here. I wanted to ask about the purpose of the additional debt issuance back in September. Could we see more aggressive stock buybacks or more M&A? I see the GoPay acquisition and I\u2019m also wondering if we\u2019ll see more acquisitions in Asia or elsewhere? Thanks. John Rainey : Thanks, Brian. Good to speak with you. I\u2019d say the debt issuance was perhaps two-fold. One, it was opportunistic. And two, it gives us more flexibility. Opportunistic in the sense that it\u2019s just it was a good time to tap into the debt markets. I talked about the various tranches of our debt and we literally secure 10-year debt at less than 3%. And so that\u2019s a very attractive rate for us and we\u2019ve got ample opportunities to allocate that capital. And it does give us more flexibility given our strategic initiatives. But there is not \u2013 don\u2019t read into that and that there is a change and how we\u2019re thinking about capital allocation. So as a reminder, we said when we provided our medium-term guidance that we expect over that time frame of approximately five years that we would spend 40% to 45% of our free cash flow to buy back stock and that we would spend between $1 billion and $3 billion in M&A activity. Now that\u2019s not necessarily each year, but that\u2019s on average over that period of time. This allows us the flexibility to do that. And importantly, as you think about the cash generating ability of our business, we will generate $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year, but that comes sort of ratably throughout the year. Going and tapping into the debt markets at this point in time gives us the opportunity to access that cash on our timing versus when we\u2019re earning that cash throughout the year. So no change to our plans. We still believe that effective capital allocation supports and contributes to long-term value creation and this was really just an opportunity to tap into the debt markets to get to a more optimal capital structure as we\u2019ve suggested for some time that gives us more flexibility. Dan Schulman : Maybe, I can just a quick add on to John\u2019s great answer there. I think on the M&A front, we obviously have quite a strong balance sheet right now some $13 billion of cash and as John mentioned, generating about $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year. We have stated that we will be acquisitive. We look at some 200 to 300 companies every quarter. We will over time and on average, as John mentioned, spend somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion. We anticipate on acquisitions, last year was a light year, but you should expect us to be acquisitive. Those acquisitions would obviously any revenues that come from would be additive to our 2020 plans. We\u2019re at 17% organic. And I think we would do \u2013 we\u2019d be on top of that. And we\u2019re continuing to look at capabilities that would improve things like consumer engagement. We would look at geographic expansion opportunities. GoPay would be a good example of that scale and scope with different partners; MELI and Uber would be good examples of that. And so no change in our capital allocation, but you should expect us to use our balance sheet in areas that would complement our internal development efforts and allow us to continue to seize growth opportunities, where we see them. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, good afternoon guys. Good numbers here. I just had a question and a clarification on 2020. The question is on the eBay front. So, only a 1% revenue headwind for next year, certainly less than the investment community had feared. So, I\u2019m just wondering, is this largely a timing issue in terms of how much of the eBay take rate comes down in 2020 specifically as well as the pace at which you expect unbranded volume to roll off? And then just a quick clarification is on the EPS growth for next year at a 17% to 18%. Is that off the new 306 to 308 number in 2019 or is the base 295 to 297 excluding the $0.11 of year-to-date mark-to-market gains? John Rainey : Hey, Jason. So, on eBay, there\u2019s a couple of dynamics going on there. The \u2013 our expectation right now is that eBay is about fully ramped to the 10% that they\u2019re allowed in each of the two entities that where they\u2019re doing managed payments, which are Germany and the U.S. So, going into the back half of next year, we would expect that those would ramp much more appreciably as they\u2019re already live in those markets. There is a more or our expectation anyway is that there is a more metered ramp for when they launch in some of these other geographies, which is consistent with kind of what we\u2019ve seen in the first two geographies, where they\u2019ve launched. I think also related to that is our expectation about what share of checkout we retain. And based upon what we\u2019ve seen in both Germany and the U.S., it\u2019s consistent to what we said back in January of 2018 around our expectations there. So, each of those elements influences our expectation around eBay, but obviously, that\u2019s an estimate at this point in time and that can change, and we will certainly let you know if something does. Dan Schulman : John, just before you get to that part, let me maybe, expand a little bit on eBay. So Jason, I think obviously, there is going to be an important and strategic partner with us for a long time to come, but it\u2019s obviously shrinking in terms of its overall volumes and its impacts on our financials. It\u2019s been three quarters in a row, where they\u2019ve had negative TPV growth. Yes, they\u2019re negative 3%, outside of that. we\u2019re growing at 31% in our TPV. And we think at the end of the OA, they\u2019re going to be down to about 6% of our overall TPV volumes. And if you think about it, like when we initially split from eBay, TPV, their percentage of TPV was around 20%, now it\u2019s dropped down to about 8%. If you look at their revenues, the revenues have dropped in half as a percent overall. And so I think it\u2019s really worth noting that while all of that\u2019s been happening, our revenues have been growing on average, call it 18% to 20% during that timeframe. Our margins have been going up. And so they\u2019re obviously a much smaller part of PayPal than we expected when we were first thinking about the OA. And therefore the transition at the end of the OA is going to be much less of an impact, much more manageable and we think that 1% of revenue growth impact is probably a pretty reasonable expectation. I\u2019d say nothing in their intermediated payouts. Right now, it gives me any incremental cause for concern. I mean maybe, even the opposite. They need regulatory approvals in all of the countries that they\u2019re going to roll out into. There is going to be a long tail that that\u2019s going to be hard to get to. China is obviously going to be an interesting discussion item on that. Merchants are increasingly beginning to sell on multiple platforms right now and they\u2019re using PayPal One Touch activation to do that. And so they\u2019re quite tight into PayPal. And we are seeing the PayPal share of checkout on intermediated payments rising significantly. And so you put all of those into place along with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in other marketplaces and our ability to start to work with some marketplaces that we weren\u2019t able to our work with before. And we think this is going to be a very manageable transition and we hope to be close partners with eBay as we go through that. John Rainey : Jason and to address your second question, which I probably should have anticipated given the noise that we\u2019ve had in some of these mark-to-market adjustments. But the earnings growth that we talked about of 17% to 18% in 2020 is on a similar base in 2019. So, it excludes the mark-to-market adjustments in 2019. Dan Schulman : Does that answer your question? Presumed so. Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Darrin Peller : Hey, thanks guys. Your margin came in materially above our estimate, it looks like operating leverage on sales and marketing and G&A, and I guess better losses I know, I think John, you mentioned, we\u2019re a lot more pronounced. What are your thoughts on what\u2019s allowing that kind of margin uptick now versus before? And just when considering I guess the pricing changes, the partial offset of eBay mid-year integrations, can you just touch on sustainability and maybe, how the 50 bps expected in 2020 would have looked if not for eBay? Thanks guys. John Rainey : Sure, Darrin. So, a couple of things; one, as we look at the outperformance in the quarter, we provide a range of estimates around revenue and earnings, and we came in at the higher end of that range that we expected. So, the revenue outperformance is one of the bigger drivers within the quarter for how we perform. But as you noted, we also performed very well on the expense side. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll our caution you about assuming that that level of sales and marketing is a run rate basis. There are a number of initiatives going on there as we go to market in a different way that have affected that quarter. And so that\u2019s just kind of a side point. But the general point around operating margin leverage and what we can do there, this is a very sustainable initiative for us. And you\u2019ll remember, Darrin, a couple of years ago when we first started this, the work in this area, there were some question about was this a one-time cost take out or was this really sustainable. I hope that we\u2019re beginning to allay the concerns around people about the sustainability of that. This is perhaps the best performance that we\u2019ve ever seen in any particular quarter, growing our organic cost, non-transaction related costs at 1.9%. And this is really just \u2013 well, if you remember, I described it at the time as we were re-plumbing our business or rewiring our business to be able to grow at a very low marginal cost. And it\u2019s literally in every aspect of the business, but I\u2019ll give you one example that maybe will really give you a flavor of how these are coming about. So we obviously have a significant number of calls that come in each month in our call center, five million on average per month. And we aspire to be able to address each of those issues that our customers have and to be on the phone with or not have them have to wait on the phone, but we\u2019re not perfect. And if you go back to last December, we had 33,000 calls that a customer had to wait over 45 minutes. I looked right before I came in here today and in the month of October we have 526 calls. Now that\u2019s a dramatic improvement, but what\u2019s noteworthy about that is we achieved that without adding a single human being to address that problem. Those were all issues around schedule efficiency, better routing when someone goes into the IVR, things like that. It just enables us to provide a better customer experience, but at the same time lower our cost. And in the scheme of five million calls a month, 33,000 is maybe not a lot, but each of those customers has an experience and that impacts whether they use us again, whether they churn in the future. So it\u2019s things like that that drive dramatic improvements in our business both on the cost line, but also what it can do for the customer experience as well. Dan Schulman : I had a couple of things to add, Darrin that I think are really important. First of all, things that you don\u2019t see that are really important to us are things like what are we doing with developer tool sets, our development platform, which makes our engineers so much more productive. Before we would have to hire a lot of people that just couldn\u2019t get their code through and now we have tool sets and an environment that is much more efficient, maybe two times the efficiency that we had before. Things like losses as we grow bigger and our transaction volume becomes larger, our ability to do machine learning on that combined with the acquisition we did of Simility, those losses now are at a lower level that we think continues as well and probably may even improve as we get larger. And finally, I would just say Venmo. Venmo used to have more and more money that we would have to put into Venmo each year as a group and it is now, instead of a drain on our margin structure, help on our margin structure as we go forward and I would expect that to continue to happen. And so all-in, I think we feel pretty good about the leverage of the model and it\u2019s why we have such strong confidence around that 20% compounding annually EPS number. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks so much. Could you give us sort of a deeper dive or status update on some of the delayed new pricing initiatives and new product integrations with partners that you called out on the second quarter earnings call. And to the extent any of those impacts are embedded in the 2020 guidance. It would be helpful to have insight? Thanks so much. John Rainey : Sure, David. This is John. I\u2019ll address that. So when we announced the delay in those initiatives initially on the last call, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we probably erred on the side of conservatism as we thought about the back half of the year and that they are both, specifically the Paymentus initiative as well as the price initiatives, they are both performing moderately better than what we expected at that point in time in terms of the pace of the integration of each of those. And we do expect to have a benefit as we have a full \u2013 as those are rolled in at the beginning of next year and we get \u2013 for the vast majority of the year get the full run rate benefit of each of those. With respect to pricing, that\u2019s been rolled out in three countries in Q4 and we\u2019ll expand that further into next year. And as a reminder, this is with respect to refund pricing and in line with industry practice, we don\u2019t charge fees to process refunds, but also in line with industry practice we are retaining the fixed and the variable piece of that and certain merchants are excluded if you have negotiated pricing and so forth, but those are performing as expected. But as we look at 2020, we\u2019ll go live with additional merchants and we will have additional price changes, always looking to price to the value that we create for our customer base as we offer expanded capabilities and experiences for them we want to be able to price to that as well. Dan Schulman : I would just say, David that pricing is an ongoing process for us. We had certain things baked into our plans and we were late on those. We had certain expectations on integration especially into Paymentus and we were late on those. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m really happy with the performance of so many people on the PayPal team. They were really laser-focused on getting those implemented in the right way. And these are complicated integrations and we want to make sure that we\u2019re fully transparent in the way we roll these things out. And so I\u2019m pretty pleased with the way the team stepped up and addressed all of that. As John mentioned, I think on the Paymentus side, we\u2019ll have full stack integration live by the end of the year. And then we start to roll in, Paymentus has almost 1,500 billers, we want to roll in all of those billers into a bill pay app right on the PayPal app and that will take into the first and second quarter before we have that completed, but the full stack integration on to our Braintree platform will happen by the end of the year. Pricing, just to reiterate what John said, pricing is an ongoing process for us. We\u2019re going to have pricing initiatives this year, next year, the year after and then the year after that. I mean we continually assess market dynamics. We look at the evolving practices of our competitors. We take a hard look at the value we provide. And then we try to price appropriately based on all those factors. And yes, we price sometimes up, sometimes we take prices down, it depends on product, it depends on corridors, it depends on regions in the world, but we\u2019re very considered about it. We do have some degree of latitude in all of those things. And right now, I think John and I are both pretty pleased where we are. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hey, good afternoon guys. Looks like other value-added services beat pretty handily in the quarter. I'm looking at it, it looks like loan growth was up about 65% year-on-year and also sequentially. So now that we're kind of clear of the Synchrony transition, can you just give \u2013 can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the role of credit in your strategy going forward and specifically, like how much of this OVAS growth is going on balance sheet versus off-balance sheet and can OVAS continue to grow like this well, well above TPV and revenue growth going forward? Thank you. John Rainey : Sure, Lisa. It's good to speak with you. So as we think about our credit strategy, obviously you're very familiar with what we did with the U.S. consumer loan portfolio when we sold that $6 billion portfolio and now we have a partnership with Synchrony going forward. That's a strategy that we like because it's very much asset light. When we look at the opportunities for credit in our business both on the merchant side as well as international consumer, they are significant growth opportunities. And we think that particularly like when we look at the merchant lending, that's where our value proposition shines when we can provide working capital loans, understanding the seasonality and the cyclicality of a merchant's business in a way that others can't with access to some of their payment flows. And so we want to continue to grow that. But what we don't want and again we've demonstrated this with our past experience, we don't want credit to become too capital intensive to where it takes away from other opportunities that we have. And so I do think that OVAS revenue and specifically credit revenue can continue to grow at a rate higher than overall TPV for PayPal. So I think that's definitely true. But if you look at our total credit receivables today, there are about $3.5 billion inclusive of both merchant and international consumer, far or less roughly half of what the U.S. consumer credit receivables were for us when we sold those and we were a much smaller company then as well. And so we will get to a point seemingly given the opportunity that's in front of us on credit where we will likely go asset light with some of one or both of those portfolios as well. I think that's further down the road, but we want to be very mindful around how we allocate capital in this business to both drive value for our shareholders, but also provide good offerings like credit for our customers. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one last question from the line of... Dan Schulman : We're going to do actually two more questions I think. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Dan, I realized it hasn't closed yet, but can you give us a sense, maybe a little bit of a history of how it came about that PayPal was chosen to do the GoPay deal, I would imagine there was a lot of competition, particularly to be the first of its kind? And then what the road map could look like for the rollout of those services and the integration that you want to see there? And then when could we see a material cross-border offering in China and how would that compare to what you're currently able to offer through Alipay relationship? Dan Schulman : Yes. Those are all good questions, Heath. And I think actually, Heath, given the extent of that question, we'll probably end after this. So first of all, obviously it's incredibly meaningful event to be the first non-Chinese company obtain a payments license to process domestic online payments in China. It's a tangible example of China opening its financial market. We have been working this diligently for years. When I say diligent, I mean literally almost every single day we've had calls and have been working this. And we worked quite closely with the PBOC, with other authorities inside of China. We worked with the administration here to enable all this to happen. And then I think what we've demonstrated across the globe and I think was appreciated by various entities within China is our ability to work closely with regulators. We've invested quite heavily in compliance and risk management and we're a strong collaborator with the financial ecosystem. We're much more partners with the financial ecosystem than go around the financial ecosystem and be a disruptor. We're innovative, but we're partners with the existing structure. And so I think all of that combined in a very good working relationship and many years of that enabled this event to happen. It's obviously pretty significant for us. It obviously increases our total addressable market quite substantially. China is the world's largest e-commerce market. I think there is something like 500 million online shoppers and they're going to drive something like $2 trillion of online sales this year, which is more than 50% of global online retail. And China is obviously an advanced and sophisticated digital marketplace, but we believe that we can offer a quite differentiated value proposition to both Chinese merchants and consumers by working closely with Chinese financial institutions, various tech platforms inside of China to connect sort of their vast commerce ecosystem with sort of our vast network of consumers and merchants outside of China. And so this is actually a substantial \u2013 substantially more than what we can do right now. So for instance, think of before we cannot work with companies and allow Chinese consumers to purchase from PayPal merchants outside of China and now we can start to facilitate that, working again in partnership with Chinese tech platforms and/or Chinese financial institutions. We can take Chinese merchants who may want \u2013 may be want to sell on other platforms and do payouts back into China through cross-border, we'll be able to enable that through our platform. Multinationals that are doing business in China can use our platform to enable their transactions and for us to process those digital payments coming across there. So, a lot of people are focusing just on the domestic consumer part of China, there's obviously opportunities there working in connection with partners inside of China, but there is a tremendous amount that we leverage, kind of the strength of our network and the strength of the vast commerce ecosystem inside China, which is significantly digital and that we think affords us some pretty significant opportunities over at least the medium to long-term. So we're quite excited about the opportunity. We'll give a lot more details as we go into next year as the transaction closes and we'll make sure that we continue to update everybody on this. So, again, Heath, thank you for that question. Operator that will be the last question. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2020, our medium-term guidance and the impact of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, January 29, 2020. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for taking the time to join us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had a strong quarter ending 2019 with record results across key customer and financial metrics. Over the past year, we meaningfully improved and expanded the PayPal platform. We strengthened our value proposition for consumers and merchants, expanded our international scope and scale, and announced transformative, strategic acquisitions, investments, and commercial agreements. For the year, we delivered $17.8 billion in revenue, that's up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, adjusted for our receivable sale to Synchrony. In the fourth quarter, we generated $4.96 billion of revenue, growing 18% on an FX-neutral basis. Our strong revenue growth combined with disciplined expense management enabled a 28% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.10. Excluding net unrealized gains on our strategic investments, we delivered $2.96 of non-GAAP EPS, up 25% on a year-over-year basis. On that same basis, in Q4 we delivered $0.84 of non-GAAP EPS, growing 28%. For 2019, our overall payment volume grew 25% on an FX-neutral basis to $712 billion. Excluding eBay, TPV grew 29% on an FX-neutral basis to $649 billion, as we continue to grow market share. In Q4 alone, we processed just shy of $200 billion of TPV, a new record for us. We've processed more than 12 billion transactions in the year, including nearly 3.5 billion transactions in Q4 alone. eBay's TPV continues to decline shrinking by 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Consequently, we anticipate that eBay will be approximately 6% of our total TPV by midyear. We added 9.3 million net new actives in the quarter, ending the year with 305 million active accounts on our platform, up 14% year-over-year, including 24 million merchants. In 2020, we expect to add approximately 35 million net new active accounts, inclusive of our acquisitions, and this does not include any one-time impact on NNAs associated with the acquisition of Honey.  I'm pleased to report that engagement continues to consistently increase. For the first time this year, engagement grew by double-digits, increasing by 10% to 40.6 transactions per active account. Mobile transactions are a major driver of our growth, representing 44% of TPV. One Touch adoption is now at a 199 million consumers and 14 million merchants. Venmo processed $29 billion in volume for the quarter, growing 56%. And for the year, volume increased to $102 billion. We ended the year with Venmo's customer base exceeding 52 million active accounts, driving its current revenue run rate of more than $450 million.  Last quarter, we announced that Venmo had signed a deal with Synchrony to provide a Venmo credit card, and I'm pleased to announce that Visa will be our exclusive network partner for this new product. We also recently announced our first-ever Venmo Rewards Program with select merchants for Venmo debit card holders. These merchant funded rewards are deposited directly into a customer's account so that they can be used in-app with merchants or transferred to a bank account or debit card, providing consumers with ease and choice.  Last year, we saw brands like Netflix, Pepsi and Chipotle use Venmo payouts to reward their customers and pay them via Venmo. We're excited to introduce new, monetizable, value-added services through our Venmo platform over the course of 2020. We continue to see strong demand for our payouts capabilities, enabled by our Hyperwallet acquisition. Digital payouts are attractive to multiple industries, including the insurance industry where consumers are demanding faster payments. In the quarter, we began delivering claims payments on behalf of insurance providers like Chubb Insurance, Asurion, and Combined Insurance. In addition, United Airlines is now leveraging our platform to pay passengers all over the world for baggage claims, and Walmart is using our capabilities to pay merchants on its marketplace. I expect to see continued growth in our payouts products. Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Honey. The addition of Honey and its complementary capabilities to the PayPal network will significantly transform our relevance and drive engagement with our consumers and merchants at the earliest stages of their commerce journey. Our integration activities are off to a strong start. Our early joint marketing activities have already produced nearly 100,000 downloads of the Honey browser extension, and on day one our customers could use their PayPal credentials to log into Honey. I continue to be impressed by the caliber of the Honey team, and I couldn't be happier to welcome them to PayPal.  We are deepening our relationships with financial institution partners around the world. We recently announced the ability for Citibank institutional clients to make payments directly into their customers\u2019 PayPal wallets. In December, we finalized the deal with FIS, which will enable us to scale our Pay with Rewards capabilities across thousands of financial institutions in the United States, and U.S. Bank has currently integrated functionality to support both account linking and Pay with Rewards capabilities.  We continue to expand our platform capabilities around the world. We've recently expanded our relationship with Uber, and we will be processing their payments in Europe, Brazil, India, and across the Middle East. In December, we also signed a commercial agreement with MercadoLibre that has a potential to drive a meaningful increase in our international scope and scale. As part of the agreement, PayPal will be made available as a payment option in the Mercado Pago online checkout for people in Brazil and Mexico, which opens the door for PayPal consumers to shop at hundreds of thousands of new merchants. PayPal will also be accepted in MercadoLibre marketplace for cross-border purchases. In return, we will offer Mercado Pago as a payment method at PayPal merchants around the world, allowing approximately 50 million Mercado Pago users in Brazil and Mexico to pay with their preferred digital wallet. And we will expand Xoom\u2019s presence by allowing Mercado Pago users to receive remittances directly into the Mercado Pago wallet. I'm pleased with our growing partnership and look forward to continued collaboration with Marcos and the MELI team.  In addition to the continued international expansion of Xoom, in Q4, we launched the ability for Xoom customers to send money to recipients in the U.S. through strategic alliances with Walmart and Euronet. Customers in the U.S. can now use Xoom to quickly send money for cash pickup, typically within minutes at nearly 5,000 locations across the country. This is a positive step in our mission to make the movement and management of money quick, easy and affordable for everyone. In December, we closed our acquisition of GoPay becoming the first foreign payment platform to be licensed to provide online payment services in China. This transaction has the potential to dramatically increase our total addressable market opportunity. Digital payments in China are expected to grow from $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion over the next four years, and the number of users is set to grow to well over 1 billion. Last week, we announced a wide reaching partnership with UnionPay International. UnionPay International has issued over 130 million cards outside of Mainland China and as part of the China UnionPay Group, which has over 7.5 billion cards on their network. As part of the agreement, our mutual customers will be able to add UnionPay cards to their PayPal wallet in more than 30 countries, allowing UnionPay customers to seamlessly shop at PayPal's 24 million merchants globally. In addition, China UnionPay will enable Chinese merchants to accept PayPal in person where CUP cards are accepted. Our two companies will collaborate to accelerate both online and offline acceptance of PayPal for Chinese merchants. This is a landmark agreement and will have global impact for our joint customers. We look forward to partnering with other Chinese financial institutions and technology platforms to expand both cross-border and in-country digital payments.  Our efforts to drive social impact and create value for all of our stakeholders continues to evolve and expand. This past year saw a record volume of funds raised by the PayPal Community for charity. For the full year of 2019 the PayPal Community donated more than $10 billion to charity, including over $1 billion in the month of December. On GivingTuesday we raised a record, $106 million. The world's secular trend towards digital payments and commerce continues to rapidly grow. Our total addressable market has significantly expanded with the acquisitions of Honey and GoPay, and our commercial partnership with MercadoLibre.  In 2020 our growth investments are focused on our recent acquisitions, growing our infrastructure in China and other international markets, Venmo monetization and our in-store point of sale initiatives. Our ability to drive and benefit from these trends and initiatives is reflected in our strong results and our expectations for 2020. We are very excited about the year in front of us. Our brand reputation and trust are stronger than ever.  We obviously need to execute, stay vigilant and remain steadfast customer champions, but we have our sights set high and we aim to aggressively expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. And I'm confident that our efforts will drive our market leadership and growth over the foreseeable future.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners, and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding year. 2019 was another great year for PayPal and I'm pleased with our team's accomplishments. The results we're reporting today demonstrate the consistent execution of our strategy to realize long-term sustainable value creation. We're entering 2020 ready to build on our momentum, focused on our key initiatives and excited about the year ahead.  Now to our fourth quarter results, revenue in the fourth quarter increased 17% on a spot basis and 18% on a currency neutral basis to $4.96 billion. The translation effect from the stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue by $35 million. This impact was more than offset by $58 million in hedge gains. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 U.S. revenue grew 19% and international revenue grew 17% on a currency neutral basis.  Transaction revenue grew 18% and revenue from other value added services grew 14%. Strength across core PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo all contributed to transaction revenue growth. Other value added services revenue growth reflected solid performance of our credit business offset by the lapping of interim servicing revenue from Synchrony. As a reminder, this headwind will continue through the second quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.27% and total take rate was 2.49%. Compared to Q4 2018, this was a decline of 8 basis points and 9 basis points respectively, which is the lowest level of decline we've reported. Strong P2P growth continues to be the largest driver of the year-over-year decline for both transaction and total take rate. In addition, on a sequential basis, both transaction and total take rate improved. The diversification of our business and our pricing initiatives allowed us to deliver these results. Volume-based expenses increased 20% in the fourth quarter to $2.3 billion. Transaction expense was 96 basis points as a rate of TPV, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. Transaction loss was 15 basis points as a rate of TPV, an improvement of 3 basis points from Q4 2018. Continued improvements in our risk management capabilities contributed to the strong performance in our loss rate. Loan losses were 4 basis points as a rate of TPV, an increase of 1 basis point from Q4 last year. This increase primarily resulted from growth in both our merchant and international consumer loan portfolios.  Transaction margin dollars grew 16% to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 53.8%, a decline of approximately 90 basis points versus Q4 '18. Non-transaction related expenses grew 7% versus last year, and increased only $0.13 for every incremental dollar of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 28% to $1.2 billion. Our operating margin was 23.6%, expanding 204 basis points from last year as we delivered leverage across all of our non-transaction related expenses. This represents our strongest performance ever, demonstrating our sustainability to scale at a low incremental cost. Other income in the fourth quarter declined by $33 million relative to last year. Net interest expense resulting from our debt issuance in September, as well as lower net unrealized gains from our strategic investments contributed to this result. As we disclosed in our 8-K issued on January 9th, in the fourth quarter, on a per share basis, net unrealized gains contributed $0.02 to EPS versus $0.04 last year. Starting in 2020, we're updating our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our strategic investments. We believe this presentation will provide a better understanding of our operating performance and a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods. With this change, we no longer will issue an 8-K following quarter end, disclosing the effect of net unrealized gains and losses on our results. In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.2% versus 17.7% last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter grew 24% to $0.86. Adjusting for net unrealized gains non-GAAP EPS grew 28%. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.6 billion. In addition, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow or approximately $0.22 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. During the quarter, we've returned $305 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases. I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. Relative to the preliminary outlook for 2020 that we provided in October, we raising our revenue expectations. We are also raising our earnings outlook excluding the dilutive effect of acquisitions announced in 2019. The guidance we're providing has been updated to reflect the impacts from our recent acquisitions of Honey and GoPay, the adoption of CECL, the new accounting standard for recognizing credit losses and our expectations for currency movements.  For the full year, we expect TPV to grow in the mid 20 percentage range. We expect to generate revenue between $20.8 billion and $21 billion. This range represents currency neutral growth of 18% to 19%, an increase from our initial outlook of 17%. Our guidance includes about 1.5 points of growth from the acquisition of Honey at the midpoint of the range. Consistent with our preliminary outlook, this revenue guidance includes an approximate 1 point headwind to growth from the lapping of our acquisitions of iZettle and Hyperwallet as well as an approximate 1 point headwind from eBay's managed payments transition.  In 2019 revenue from eBay's Marketplaces business declined 4% and represented 14% of our revenue, and approximate 300 basis point decline from 2018. Since the end of 2015, eBay's annual contribution to our revenue has consistently declined from 26% of our total to 14% today and has grown at a compound annual rate of 2%.  Over the same period, the rate of growth for the rest of our business has been 22% or 10 times eBay's growth rate. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate eBay's continued transition to its managed payments program. I would now like to turn to our EPS guidance. On our third quarter call, we indicated that our preliminary outlook for EPS growth in 2020 was 17% to 18%. Since then our expectations for core earnings growth have improved. Before incorporating the impact of the two acquisitions we recently closed, we now expect our EPS to grow between 18% and 20%. This growth rate of 18% to 20% incorporates a 1 point headwind to earnings growth from CECL, while reflecting our underlying business strength. In addition, we expect $0.08 to $0.10 in dilution or about a 3 point headwind to earnings growth from our acquisitions of Honey and GoPay. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 15% to 17% and be in the range of $3.39 to $3.46. While we expect the acquisition of Honey to be diluted this year, we expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings in 2021. Honey is an exciting addition to our platform and this year we will be accelerating investments to develop a truly integrated and differentiated wallet experience for our customers. We're also realizing dilution in 2020 from funding this acquisition with cash. In addition in 2020 following our acquisition of GoPay, we're investing in our local Chinese infrastructure and capabilities and building upon our new partnership with China UnionPay to strengthen the foundation of our cross-border platform for small and medium sized Chinese businesses and develop a cross-border shopping experience for Chinese consumers. We will also be investing to enable in-store shopping experiences for non-Chinese consumers visiting China. I'd also like to provide some context for our expectations related to our operating margin performance. In 2019, we expanded our operating margin by approximately 160 basis points or nearly 3 times the average annual rate of expansion contemplated by our medium-term guidance. In 2020, we expect our operating margin to remain essentially flat as a result of absorbing acquisition-related dilution, while continuing to invest in our other key strategic initiatives. This year as Dan just discussed, in addition to prioritizing spending on our recent acquisitions, we're also investing in Venmo, our new partnerships, international expansion and our in-store point-of-sale strategies. We expect to deliver operating margin performance consistent with the highest in our history, while investing in these significant growth opportunities.  We anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be between 16% and 18%. For 2020, we expect free cash flow to exceed $4 billion, as we continue to generate approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. In 2019, we returned more than $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and announced approximately $4.1 billion of acquisitions. In 2020, we will continue to balance return of capital with growth investments while maintaining an efficient capital structure. Our acquisition pipeline is healthy and our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic. At the same time, we plan to continue to return cash to shareholders, consistent with our stated commitment for long-term capital return. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion or 17% to 18% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, representing growth of 15% to 18%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our earnings guidance represents 19% to 22% growth. We expect our acquisitions announced in 2019 to have a more dilutive impact on earnings in the first half of 2020 than in the back half of the year. As a result, the $0.08 to $0.10 per share of expected non-GAAP earnings dilution is more heavily weighted to the first and second quarters of 2020. In summary, we're pleased with our performance in 2019. We delivered strong revenue growth, our highest operating margin and record operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation. At the same time, we advanced our strategic priorities in our core and developing markets, strengthened our consumer and merchant value propositions, and launched new partnerships that are expanding our total addressable market. We're committed to our medium-term financial targets and are confident that the strength of our diversified platform, flexibility of our balance sheet and execution capabilities will allow us to continue delivering value to our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien Tsin Huang : Thanks. Good afternoon. A lot of good information here. So, I'll ask on the outlook if you don't mind, just your guidance this year versus last year. Aside from Honey, how would you characterize overall visibility this year versus this time a year ago? It seems like you have more in your control but still lots of moving pieces, so would love your thoughts on visibility. Dan Schulman : Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. This is Dan. I'll start on that and then may be John will fill in on it. First of all, we had a strong Q4, and actually an even stronger back half of Q4. The holiday season was strong for us. December was strong. And frankly, we're seeing a strong January as well. And that comes from a couple of things that we actually really didn't have the year before. First of all, I think we are executing a lot better than we have for quite some time. Second and really important, because we have the visibility in this, we have seen the pricing that we talked about start to get implemented. It's implemented in a number of countries. We still have more countries to even roll that out into, but that's going exactly according to plan. We signed a number of very large deals at the end of the year. We implemented many of those in December, and we are seeing that those growth rates begin to kick in. Those are deals like Paymentus that we\u2019ve talked about, but other very large multi-billion dollar deals as well. And so, we\u2019re entering this year in really a fundamentally different place than we entered the year before, a lot of momentum. For instance, we feel very comfortable with our forecast around TPV. We're talking about TPV being in the mid-20s. That was 22% in Q4, but of that 22% actually 200 basis points I guess was because of the lapping of iZettle. So, if you normalize for that, you're at 24, a little weakness in eBay; and then we've got these big deals that are already implemented and accelerating, others like Uber to come. And we feel very comfortable with our TPV accelerating into the mid-20s. So, I'd say overall we're pretty excited about where we're starting off the year, things that we already have in place, and we have a ton of initiatives that we're excited about as well. So, I don\u2019t know John, if you add to that? John Rainey : Yes. I\u2019d maybe underscore a couple points that Dan mentioned. I think what's notable Tien-Tsin about this year versus last year is, in particular how we are starting off the year. There's always a certain amount of trepidation that exists about the macro economy, but I think the macro economy was maybe a little wobblier last year. And as we certainly enjoyed, I think a better holiday season this period as we look the month of December, even going into January. And so, we're starting off on the right start but also I'd underscore the point he mentioned around execution. We recognize that we have a pretty precious opportunity here at PayPal when you combine the secular tailwinds of our business with the incredible assets that we have when you look at our portfolio of products, and it\u2019s incumbent upon us to execute. And I think the team is executing as well now as they ever have. So, again I think that gives us more confidence than on a relative basis versus last year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on a lot of different incremental market opportunities, but I want to touch on Venmo and the efforts to continue to develop that as a separate brand. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what the objectives are for growing Venmo monetization during 2020 and beyond, and how we should be measuring those? And I guess, kind of dovetailed with that, now that, Visa owns Plaid, it seems like -- just wondering how that may impact the ability to grow Venmo and some of these other ancillary services whether it be internationally, et cetera? Thanks a lot. Dan Schulman : Yes, James. Thanks for the question. We continued to be pleased every quarter with the performance of Venmo. Even as it\u2019s gotten larger, we've seen strong net new actives, and we\u2019ve got 52 million now at year end. We\u2019ve always said we thought Venmo would wind up with over 100 billion of TPV and it wound up at 102 billion, and it\u2019s up about 60% for the year exited, I think at about 56% of growth rate. Its revenue run rate right now is over $450 million. And as we're getting that scale on the revenue side, we're beginning to see losses reduce as well each year. So, we kind of have a line of sight to when breakeven is and when this starts to actually turn profitable as well. We don't want to slow down its growth at all. We want to keep enabling Venmo to grow as rapidly as possible, but we\u2019re really pleased with this trajectory and I expect to see good revenue growth, continued strong, strong revenue growth on the Venmo side. We're adding new capabilities all the time. Debit is continuing to expand. We're going to put a big emphasis on Pay with Venmo. There's a lot of work going on around that right now because we think that's a very big opportunity that we did not take as much advantage of last year as we probably could have. As I mentioned, we are going to be developing a credit card. That was a very competitive process with a number of issuers looking to work with us on that. It\u2019s very competitive on the network side too. So, we're really pleased with the economics around that. You will see us add things like just like goods and services. Goods and services is one of the biggest moneymakers on the PayPal P2P side. We're going to add that into the Venmo side, and there are a number of other monetizable services that you'll see come out that will reveal in good time as they're introduced. In terms of Plaid, we've worked quite closely with Plaid in terms of using Plaid to integrate into bank accounts of different banks. We're working sometimes with some of the larger banks to integrate directly and with Plaid really for quite a number of the banks and really for that long tail. We were really happy with the acquisition of Plaid by Visa. We work obviously very, very closely with Visa and MasterCard and the other networks, but very closely with Visa. We're an investor in Plaid, so we know them quite well. And I think the security enhancements that Visa will do on top of the Plaid network will have the banks more comfortable in utilizing Plaid. Visa obviously has a tremendous global scale. And as you saw in the Plaid announcement from Visa, I was one of the folks quoted on that, because we really look forward to working with Visa to see how we can take advantage of this joint platform now that they own Plaid and there could be a lot of different opportunities as a result of that. I hope that answers. Anything else, John? John Rainey : No. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. John, I was just hoping to get clarification on the TPV. The FX-neutral growth dropped from 27% in 3Q to 22% in 4Q. So, I just want to understand that delta, but probably the more importantly is the walk or reacceleration to the mid-20% going into this year. So, I know I'm not sure how much Honey is a factor there or the Uber, UnionPay, MELI deals. Maybe you can give us a walk on how to get back to that mid-20s TPV? Thanks. John Rainey : Sure, Bryan. It\u2019s good to speak with you. So, if you look at our TPV whether you will get overall or international, the biggest single driver of the decline is related to the lapping of the iZettle acquisition. In fact, if you just look at international TPV, the entirety of that 4 point decline is attributable to iZettle. But looking at TPV in total, there are some other factors but one is obviously eBay. We saw about 1 point decline related to eBay. And if you sort of decompose that a little bit even look at our transactions, and you look at the various parts of our business, the transactions related to eBay declined 6% for us in the quarter.  And so, this has been something that we\u2019ve talked about. The next year we will begin that period where we will transition away from that but we are still seeing the rest of our business grow quite well. So as we look into 2020, there are a number of things that will bridge that back to the mid-20s. A part of it is just the acceleration we are seeing in the business right now as Dan alluded to in the December, January timeframe. But we've got international expansion going on next year. We have got some work being done with large merchants. You know that we're are ramping up with Paymentus and other parts of our business that we are emphasizing more like recurring payments, subscriptions, bill pay that give us confidence that we will be able to achieve that mid-20s TPV number even in a period where we are transitioning away from the eBay. And I think it's worth mentioning, in doing it, while expanding operating margins in 2019 and given us the latitude to make the investments that we need in 2020 to continue this trend of mid 20s TPV growth into the future. Dan Schulman : Yes. I\u2019ll just add a little bit onto what John said, what probably pleased me the most about Q4 is to see coming out of it the reacceleration of a lot of our core trends. Our core business started to accelerate. Braintree, even though it's gotten larger and larger, I\u2019ll bet its growth rate will be larger than it was this year going forward. We know what deals we have in place and we know we've got, I would say, quite good visibility into what our TPV looks like. So we're very comfortable with that projection on that and we're seeing it in our trend lines. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Good afternoon guys. A question on China. Now that you've successfully acquired the majority stake of GoPay and then signed the more recent expanded agreement with CUP, could you just provide a bit of color on your overall market entry strategy to the domestic market there? Meaning, are you more focused on say building out the presence of the PayPal wallet as a competitor to some of the local digital wallets? Or are you more focused on Braintree and building out broader payment processing? Could you give us a little bit of color there? Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yes, sure. I'll take that. And then John can do that. I\u2019d say Lisa the first idea that we had working with the PBoC is people now need to have a legal basis to have a payments license inside China to provide both cross-border and domestic payments capability. We worked over the last several years closely with the PBoC and we invested a lot of dollars and resources into our compliance and risk management efforts across the business. So not only do we have a close relationship with PBoC, but now with regulators around the world. That legal basis allows us to look at cross-border and work very closely with multinational that have established shop in China, one of the few platforms where that international payments traffic go over. We also now have the ability to work inside of China with either folks like CUP, other tech platforms, financial institutions inside China to link their cards into our wallet so Chinese consumers can use our platform to do purchases at our 24 million merchants outside of China.  One of the most exciting things that we have though going on, because it has agreement that we have with UnionPay International and China UnionPay is really a landmark arrangement. I mean inside China, China UnionPay is the network, it's equivalent of deals that we might've struck with Visa, MasterCard, Discover and AmEx all in one. That's significant in terms of a player. Obviously, we have very close relationships with the banks and we believe that we can start linking their payment instruments into our wallet and China UnionPay and PayPal will be looking to expand acceptance of the PayPal wallet with Chinese merchants. And that will enable also travelers coming into China to be able to use PayPal wallet to purchase and as you know Lisa probably better than anybody on this call, if you're going to be buying things inside China, it is with your mobile phone, it is with QR codes, and if you\u2019re visitor coming it\u2019s difficult to start to do those purchases and you will now be able to use your PayPal account to go and do that. Again, this will take some time to develop and to implement but that is our vision.  And I would also say in our conversations with some of the key players inside of China, other capabilities on our platform like full-stack processing. They are interested in utilizing those capabilities and working with merchants as well. So, it's a relatively comprehensive set of opportunities we have. I know some folks believe because obviously the strong positions that Ali and WeChat have inside the company, wondering how much opportunity. This is an exclusive market. We are going to be working hand-in-hand with key Chinese players inside the market. It's a strength in cross-border. And we think the combination of that offers a significant opportunity for us. Again, this will play out over time, but I have to say, we're pretty excited and investing against this opportunity. John Rainey : Lisa, I'd add to that I think a couple of points. It is a significant investment that we are managing in 2020, and that we will carry into 2021. But it's also a significant opportunity. Just the estimates that I see is, by next year, China will be 40% of worldwide cross-border TPV. And this is a market where we have roughly 1% penetration into their 0.5 billion digital users. And you compare that to our core markets where we're significantly penetrated, if we can turn that 1% into 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, that's a big opportunity for us. But I think one thing I want to emphasize around this investment is, the things that we're doing in China and the way that we're investing there, it\u2019s a scalable solution for other markets. So, we're approaching it as if there will be other opportunities where we can have a much more prominent presence in those markets versus kind of dabbling in some of these markets like we do today without our full product. And so, we're taking a very long-term perspective and investing appropriately given the significance of the opportunity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Hey. Thanks guys. Look, it\u2019s good to see your confidence in TPV growth being mid-20s again for the year. I assume a part of that is engagement. Engagement obviously did well this quarter, it was up 10%, it accelerated. Just I'd love to hear more about the drivers of that. How sustainable that is, do you expect that 10% growth rate to either stay the same or get better? And then when we think about Honey, a big part of our thesis on Honey is that the flywheel effect could help that even more. Can you just touch on the opportunity there as well? Thanks guys. Dan Schulman : Yes. Darrin, it\u2019s Dan. Thanks for that question. I think you know from talking to us that engagement is one of the most important drivers for us and we are very focused on it. When I started some almost six years ago now, we were at 17 times a year. We're at 41 right now. But our goal and we realize that this is aspirational, it's for somebody to use PayPal or Venmo every single day. That is our goal is to have daily engagement with that and we have a long ways to go before we get there. Honey, we think significantly increases our engagement with consumers. It allows us to be more towards the beginning of the shopping journey more towards the intent piece of this. The great thing is that one-third of all commerce transactions start with some sort of trigger based event whether that be a promotion or some kind of deal and Honey enables us to take a full advantage of this trigger based type of capabilities.  And Honey is not just coupons, it's far from it, it's a mobile shopping assistance. It's an offers platform, it provides rewards. It has price tracking tools and alerts that are droplist and wishlist, that kind of thing. And so we think -- and by the way, Honey team had already saved, last year alone, its customers, a $1 billion of opportunity on products and services. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity for engagement and scaling of that Honey app is we integrate it into the PayPal and Venmo apps.  But that's only one part of what we're thinking about in terms of engagement. We talked about Paymentus and a lot of what we -- people think about Paymentus as the full-stack integration that we're doing with them. But we're also going to be implementing bill pay capabilities into our consumer apps.  Bill pay is obviously another form of engagement. John mentioned recurring payments whether it be your Spotify, Hulu, Disney, any of a number of recurring payment streams where we can make it simple and easy for you to pay that if your credit card expires, we'll automatically update it. You don\u2019t have to keep pulling that out. So we're going to do a turnaround that. And one of the big areas of opportunity for us is starting to move into the offline space. 10%, 12% of commerce is done online in mobile, that\u2019s obviously growing rapidly. But you look at the tremendous opportunity around the world and even here in the United States beginning to move into offline through things like whether it be iZettle capabilities on the merchant side, whether it be through all the parts and we are major issuer of cards right now tied into your PayPal account or through QR codes which we are already experimenting with. And if you look inside your PayPal app or your Venmo app, you will see prominently displayed a scan capability or the ability to show your own QR code to be scanned by merchant and we have the wherewithal in all Android phones but not Apple phones yet to be able to use the NFC chip to be able to do tap-to-pay capabilities. And so, that will be another big thing that we will be investing in this year, all around driving engagement. And the big thing about engagement, as you think about net new actives, when you get to be the scale that we are now with 305 million people on our platform, every time you start to improve that engagement, churns comes down as well and lifetime value starts to go up. And so, this can be a real flywheel for us and we are investing heavily in our engagement activities, and I would expect to see good engagement growth. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one last question from David Togut with Evercore. David Togut : Thank you. Good afternoon. Bridging to Darrin's question, if you could perhaps expand upon integration plans and priorities for Honey Science? And then just as a quick follow-up, now that own Honey for a few weeks, any updated thoughts on capital allocation priorities between share repurchase and further acquisitions? John Rainey : David, I'll start with the last part of your question and let Dan talk a little bit about some of the integration plans. We don't anticipate changing our capital allocation priorities going forward. And as a reminder, that's spending about 40% to 50% of our free cash flow towards returning -- buying back stock, returning cash to shareholders and then $1 billion to $3 billion per year in acquisitions. Again, I'd point you to the cash generation of our business and I think that gives us in some ways a competitive advantage versus the other players in the landscape that we compete with because we have the opportunity to go out and acquire companies and acquire capabilities as well as invest internally, as well as return cash to shareholders. And many times things that we want to go after inorganically allow us to be faster to market or to provide capabilities that we maybe think are better than others. And so, we will continue to be acquisitive. We will continue to return cash to shareholders and we will continue to invest in our shelves. Dan Schulman : And David, let me drill in. But before I answer that, operator, I think we have time for one more question after this. So, maybe we will just keep the line open for one more additional question. So, a quick update on Honey. First of all, I said this in my opening remarks, I want to emphasize it, the caliber of that Honey team is extraordinary. They have great product and engineers. They react extraordinarily quickly. When we acquired Xoom, admittedly that was a number of years ago and our tech stack did not have a whole of the service-oriented architecture that we have today but we were able to -- with Xoom, it took us something like six to nine months to integrate log in with PayPal on to the Xoom app. With Honey, day number one, PayPal customers could log-in with their credentials right on to the Honey app. Day number one, they are doing cross-marketing together. We have a full plan over the course of the year by quarter on exactly functionality that we are integrating together.  The big thing for us is to integrate Honey into our mobile apps. We have significant scale on those mobile apps and it\u2019s relatively heavy engineering lift. But we're looking at that in the back half of this year. But there are host of payment capabilities that we will integrate into the Honey app going forward that are our payment capabilities, credit type of capabilities. And so we've got a full integration plan in place. I'm pretty pleased with the execution against that. As John mentioned, our execution capabilities are humming along pretty well right now, and I do think the combination of Honey and PayPal is a very, very strong one. I think we can enhance the ways we serve both consumers and merchants. Merchants who are looking to us for full solutions right now are looking to our products to basically increase their sales in a world of digital commerce and Honey is a big tool set for that. And we're excited about working with not just 30,000 merchants they have today but pretty dramatically accelerating that. And obviously it drives engagement and savings for consumers. It enables us to move beyond checkout. We can enable personalized time and relevant offers for consumers and become a highly value-added partner to our merchants. So, we're quite excited about it, pleased with the integration so far, a lot to do, but we are very focused on it. One more question, operator. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you. I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about China and some of the other bigger initiatives in 2020 already. But can we step back and just talk about -- and maybe even prioritize sort of where those investment priorities in 2020 fall and the incremental costs that you see associated with them, where those fall in the guidance? And then, as we look out over time sort of the ability that you see to sustain operating margin expansion over time as you take on those incremental costs? John Rainey : Sure, Heath. This is John. I'll tackle that. Well it's not a comprehensive list. I would say a couple of things that stand out in terms of our investment priorities for 2020. One would be the consumer value proposition, and a sub-bullet or sub-bullets underneath that are Honey as well as what we're doing with expanding offline point-of-sale offerings. So that's a big investment priority. Also Venmo is a big investment priority and I'd also throw in there international expansion, all of those -- and international expansion includes China.  So all of those things are of significant cost and really are of a significant magnitude that absent that we'd be expanding operating margins again next year. But I'll point you to a number that I think maybe can help direct you to how think about our long-term capability to expand operating margin. So in the quarter, if you looked at our incremental operating margin, so the incremental growth in operating income divided by the incremental revenue was roughly 35%. And I think that's a fantastic number and one that's really been pretty consistent throughout the year, but at a much higher level than what it's been in previous years. And this is the point that I continue to go back to about our ability to grow our platform at a low incremental cost.  And if we can continue to generate the type of revenue growth that we have and do it at a low marginal cost that results in incremental operating margins north of 30%, then I'm confident we're going to create a lot of shareholder value here. And I think that's a good way to think about our business long-term. Dan Schulman : Yes. I\u2019d just add to that. I mean I think about our guidance for 2020, this is the beginning of the eBay transition. We're ending the year closing in on $18 billion and we are talking about FX-neutral revenue growth of 18% to 19%. We're looking at, excluding acquisitions, something like 19% to 21% EPS growth especially absorbing the CECL impact on that. If you look over the last three years, our EPS CAGR has grown at 27%. And so we have really strong conviction in our ability to execute against our medium term guidance. And I think John is right, we want to invest, we want to seize growth opportunities that are ahead of us and do that in a way that's consistent with the medium term guidance that we've put out as well as execute year-over-year.  So I think we're feeling like we're entering into 2020 in a strong position and it gives us more confidence than we had when we entered into last year and a lot of conviction around our medium term guidance. Dan Schulman : So I want to thank you, Heath, for that question and thank all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks a lot. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect.

I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Shorie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2020. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations. Due to the length of our prepared comments today, we plan to allow for additional time for questions. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will also discuss April 2020 results, which are preliminary in nature subject to change and may not be representative of second quarter 2020 results. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and the impact of our acquisition. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, May 6, 2020. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle. Thanks everyone for joining the call. Let me start off by expressing my hope that all of you and your loved ones are safe and healthy in these unprecedented times. I think we all would agree that COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the way we think about the future. One profound change will be a dramatic acceleration from physical to digital. It's clear that digital payments have evolved from a nice to have capability to an essential service. There has always been a distinct secular trend toward digital payments, but the current environment has rapidly accelerated that movement. Our products and services have never been more needed and more relevant. We've worked hard in recent years to establish PayPal as one of the world's most trusted digital payments brands, with substantial reach and scale for both consumers and merchants, and those efforts are clearly paying off. In the past month, there has been unprecedented demand for our products and services. Our transactions are up 20% year-over-year, with branded transactions up over 43% more than double pre-COVID levels in January and February. On May 1st, we had our largest single day of transactions in our history, larger than last year's transactions on Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Our net new actives hit record highs in April, surging over a 140% from January and February levels, averaging approximately 250,000 net new active accounts per day. For the month of April, we added an all-time record of 7.4 million net new customers. I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we also had a record Q1 adding 10 million net new accounts, but that will pale in comparison to the 15 million to 20 million net new active accounts we anticipate adding in Q2. And last but certainly not least, in April, our revenues grew by 20% on an FX-neutral basis, including record revenue growth of 35% in our PayPal checkout experiences. I'll expand on these trends in a moment, to say, clearly highlight the strength of our customer value proposition. Like many other companies, our first quarter was a study in contrast. We had a very strong January and February, with FX-neutral revenues growing by an average of 18% and TPV growing at 26%. We began to see some COVID-19 impacts in late February, but the strength of our overall business outweighed cross border weakness coming out of China. However, all that changed as we exited the first week of March. Shelter-in-place and social distancing became the norm across the globe, and as one economy after another effectively shut down, we saw a substantial revenue decline, predominantly in our travel and ticketing verticals. Some of our important customers, including Uber, Airbnb and Live Nation saw rapid decreases in transaction volumes. That said the diversity of our business by merchant size and geography meaningfully offset margin pressures. In fact, excluding increased credit reserves driven by the macroeconomic environment, our Q1 non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.83, growing by 26% and well exceeding our prior guidance of $0.76 to $0.78. In addition, excluding those incremental reserves, our operating margin would have been 24.7%, more than 200 basis points better than Q1 last year. Finally, our free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. Revenues in Q1 were up 13.5% on an FX-neutral basis to $4.618 billion. When we provided guidance in January, we had expected revenue growth to be between 17% to 18%. This gap in our growth relative to our previous expectations was predominantly due to the decreased revenues from our travel and ticketing verticals as well as from lower revenue related to our credit business. As I mentioned earlier, we began to see a very noticeable shift in our results toward the end of March and throughout April. We saw dramatic increases in our daily net new actives and overall engagement levels. Our daily number of transactions accelerated throughout the month growing from the beginning of April until month end by 25% with 7.4 million net new actives, record engagement and transaction volumes and 20% revenue growth. I would characterize April is perhaps our strongest month since our IPO. This rapid growth across our metrics is led by distinct preferences in consumer behavior. Our market research indicates in approximate 50% lift in consumer willingness to buy, when PayPal is present at checkout. On average, merchants who accept PayPal experience a 60% increase in purchase conversion. This is driving very strong revenue growth across almost all regions of the globe. Notably, it is our branded experiences that are gaining the most traction. As a result, we expect our Q2 OI margin to increase year-over-year, excluding the need for any potential additional macroeconomic related reserves. Consequently, we would expect strong EPS and free cash flow growth in Q2, and John will cover our guidance in his remarks. I'm extraordinarily proud of the entire PayPal team for delivering these strong results. In the midst of considerable upheaval, they have reacted to the crisis with unprecedented speed, focus and passion. For instance, as soon as the impacts from the virus began to be felt, our team began discussions with government officials across the world to offer our support. Our global scale platform capabilities and brand reputation are all attractive assets for governments to quickly and efficiently distribute payments. In the US, we work closely with Treasury, the SBA, congressional leaders and multiple other agencies on many aspects of the CARES Act, including distributing loans to small businesses and stimulus checks to consumers. It was an important and proud moment when we became one of the very first non-bank lenders approved to distribute the Paycheck Protection Program funds to the small businesses we serve. We have already funded tens of thousands of loans, distributed well over $1 billion with an average loan size of $35,000, and PayPal and Venmo customers in the US are eligible to receive their economic stimulus payment directly into their digital wallet. Digital payments whether online or in-store will become an integral part of our daily lives, even when shelter-in-place restrictions lift. Governments, regulators and merchants of all sizes are now appealing to us to expand PayPal and Venmo into in-store checkout flows in order to help enable a safe checkout experience. Consequently, we intend to accelerate a rollout of our in-store digital payments in all markets that support our P2P payments. The need for contactless payments is more important than ever before as consumers and merchants move away from handling cash or touching keypads and adhere to strict social distancing requirements. The steps we've taken over the last several years have positioned us to extend our market leadership in the digital payments industry, with services that are arguably more important than ever before. Our acquisitions of Xoom, iZettle, Hyperwallet, GoPay and Honey had positioned us to lead in the era of digital commerce and payments. Each of our acquired capabilities take on heightened importance in a time where online and offline have blurred almost overnight for merchants of all sizes and where consumers have embraced e-commerce and digital forms of payment as a way of life. The opportunities for Honey and PayPal to help consumers find the items they need at prices they can afford have never been more important for both merchants and consumers. To put that in perspective, in April, Honey's net new actives grew nearly 180% from pre-COVID levels. And for the month of April, revenues for Honey were up over 40% from January and February. COVID-19 has presented all of us with a unique set of challenges that will very likely change our lives post pandemic, but in many ways, it's only reinforced the way we think about our business and our stakeholders. I've always felt that putting our employees first is the best way to build a great brand and an enduring financially strong company. We took significant steps to assure our employees financial health well before this crisis. Our north star is always to do the right thing for our employees, ensuring their safety, security and financial health. We made a commitment that no employee would be laid off as a direct result of COVID-19. We also focus our attention on our customers, who need our products and services more than ever as well as our empathy and support. We took a series of important actions to help our merchants and consumers, everything from allowing small business customers to defer payments on their business loans, increasing protections with regards to refunds and chargebacks, waiving instant funds transfer fees and doubling cash back rewards for the PayPal business debit card. These initiatives will impact our revenues and operating income in Q2 and that impact is contemplated in our Q2 guidance. These actions are consistent with our company's values and I'm absolutely convinced that the costs associated with supporting our employees and customers will be vastly exceeded by the benefits generated from these actions. This is a time when a financially strong company like PayPal needs to demonstrate that our purpose, mission and values guide our actions. We're also supporting our consumers around the globe by directly funding NGOs and charities who are supporting those impacted by the pandemic. Our PayPal and Venmo platforms have exploded with friends, family and countless celebrities helping each other through this time. Venmo and PayPal users are leveraging our platform to virtually tip service providers, bartenders, musicians, artists and small businesses as well as to send contributions to schools, places of worship and hospitals. And we are helping Facebook, Verizon, Google, Airbnb, Uber, Live Nation, Spotify and many other partners to raise money for those in need by enabling them to use our many platform capabilities. This is an unprecedented time in our history. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted almost everyone around the globe. It's demonstrated how connected our world is and it will change the way we live our daily lives. Digital platforms combined with real world solutions have enabled us to navigate many of the unique challenges of the pandemic, and I believe we will look back at this time as a tipping point, where digital payments both offline and online became an essential element of our lives, hastening the demise of cash, enforcing a reimagination of commerce, retailing and the payment system, and we intend to be a driving force as those trends unfold. We've always committed to being a model corporate citizen. I'm inspired everyday by our employees and what they're doing to help our customers. Many are working seven days a week and late into the night because they know that PayPal has become a critical lifeline in the everyday lives of our customers. We will come out of this crisis much stronger and significantly more relevant than ever before. This is our time to make a difference and we are determined to seize it, do our part and make a lasting and positive impact. And with that, I'll hand it over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I want to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for how they've responded to these unprecedented events. Their tireless efforts to go above and beyond in order to help our customers and help each other have been amazing. COVID-19 has certainly taken a path that has left a tremendous amount of personal and economic destruction in its wake. It's moved from something that we hear about on the nightly news to something that is more personal, having a tangible effect on our lives. Our thoughts are with those of you who have been most impacted. For all of the very real concern on a personal level as well as the economic damage from appropriate measures to combat the virus, our business is strong, resilient and performing very well. We have a very strong balance sheet, durable streams of earnings and cash flow and we're levered to parts of the economy that are benefiting from social distancing and shelter-in-place, namely e-commerce. We entered this environment from a position of strength coming off very strong results in 2019. We are successfully navigating this crisis and have confidence that we will emerge from this period even more strongly positioned. Dan spent time discussing our volume trends and earnings results in the quarter. I would like to provide additional details on our revenue and expense performance as well as how our results compared to our expectations going into the first quarter. Our Q1 revenue guidance provided in January called for 17% to 18% growth on a currency neutral basis, and our Q1 non-GAAP earnings guidance was for $0.76 to $0.78 per share. As Dan noted, the first quarter was a study in contrast between March and the first two months of the quarter. Consistent with our expectations, we saw very strong volume trends in both January and February, with volumes growing 26% on a combined basis. In March, we faced headwinds as the environment rapidly shifted and volumes grew 7%, which resulted in 19% TPV growth overall for the quarter. In Q1, on a foreign currency-neutral basis, total revenue grew 13.5%, transaction revenue grew 15%, and other value-added services revenue grew 2%. Transaction revenue growth was primarily affected by weakness in the travel and events vertical and slower Asian cross border e-commerce. Growth in other value-added services revenue was much lower relative to our mid-teens growth expectations. We earned less credit income as a result of the proactive measures we took to help our customers, including relief from interest and late fee payments. To a lesser extent, this revenue was also affected by lower interest rates on customer balances. On a combined basis, these COVID related impacts resulted in approximately 5 points of pressure to revenue growth in the quarter. On the expense side, we had another quarter of strong transaction expense and transaction loss performance. Transaction expense was 91 basis points as a rate of TPV, a decline of 5 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year and large part due to a shift in our volume mix related to COVID. Transaction loss was 13 basis points, an improvement of 5 basis points year-over-year and the fourth consecutive quarter in which we performed in this range. On an absolute basis, transaction loss dollars declined 14%. This is some of the best performance we've seen in our history for both of these expense line items, and together they provided nearly 150 basis points of leverage. At the same time, given the unprecedented pace and scale of the decline in the broader economy and the macro related adjustments that the new CECL accounting standard mandates, we increased our reserves for expected credit losses. This flows directly to credit loss expense and resulted in a $227 million macro related charge in the quarter, which after taxes equates to a $0.17 per share impact to earnings. At the beginning of the quarter, our reserve coverage covered 11% of our outstanding loan and interest receivables balance. In response to changed macroeconomic forecast, our reserve coverage increased 54%, and now covers 17% of our portfolio. Non-volume related expenses increased by 6%, entirely related to our recent acquisitions as compared to a year ago. On an organic basis, these expenses were flat. As we demonstrated consistently for several years now, we remain disciplined in our expense management. Much of our expense base is volume related and serves as a natural hedge as volumes come down. Further, we have many levers on the non-volume expenses to sustain our track record of strong earnings growth. I want to emphasize, however, that we are focused on building a great company for the long term, and will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities, while acting prudently from an expense standpoint. We'll remain agile and responsive to how the economic environment is playing out and we'll continue to appropriately invest in our business in a manner that we believe maximizes shareholder value. Operating margin for the quarter was 19.7%. Adjusting for increased macro related reserves, our operating margin would have been 24.7%, improving more than 200 basis points year-over-year and more than 100 basis points sequentially. Overall, we're pleased with the durability of our earnings stream and believe that we are well positioned to continue delivering strong results even in the face of this exogenous shock. We grew revenue 13.5% on volume growth of 19%, while generating a 20% operating margin in the quarter and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. In addition, excluding the $0.17 earnings impact from the macro related charge to our credit business, we would have outperformed our expectations and delivered $0.83 in EPS for Q1, which demonstrates the underlying strength of our business. This strength allows us to take actions that will have a short-term financial impact, but are absolutely the right thing for our customers, for our long-term competitive positioning and for the economy overall. And in fact, we believe these actions will make us even stronger going forward. We're in a very strong position from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective. We ended the quarter with more than $10 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In March, we elected to draw down $3 billion on our credit facility or 50% of our available capacity to maximize our flexibility. In addition, in the first quarter, our free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year, and for the full year, we continue to expect to generate approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Our financial position will allow us to be opportunistic and successfully navigate this period as we assess ways that we might be able to capitalize on current market conditions. During the quarter, we also repurchased $800 million of stock through a previously implemented 10b5-1 program. Overall, from a capital allocation standpoint, there is no change to our previously discussed strategy. We'll continue to prioritize organic investing to achieve our growth objectives and have rapidly shifted some of our efforts in response to this new operating environment, and the increased demand for our products and services. After investing organically, we will balance share buyback with acquisitions and investments. I now want to shift to how we're thinking about things going forward. There are obviously many variables that are outside of our control that will impact our results for the rest of the year. Most notably the path of the virus, the duration of the measures put in place to combat it, and the health of the global economy. Our business is strong and we expect to continue to show earnings strength and durability. At the same time, given the lack of visibility into the near-term economic effects of COVID-19 and the wider range of potential outcomes, we believe it is prudent to pull our previous guidance for the full year. To be very clear, there is a difference between our ability to accurately predict the impact of COVID-19 on our business in the back half of the year and our overall confidence in our business. We will continue to update you on our business trends as we move through the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, we are guiding revenue growth of approximately 15% on a currency neutral basis, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 20%. I want to provide some context for this guidance. Our revenue and earnings guidance for Q2 is our best estimate at this time and incorporates our April results and the potentially wider range of outcomes that we may experience in May and June. Perhaps the biggest factor impacting our revenue performance for the second quarter is the extent to which behavioral changes associated with social distancing measures continue at the same pace. Our branded payments experiences are clearly benefiting from the increase in e-commerce spend as a result of these measures. We are assuming that these measures are slowly relaxed over the next two months, but expect that we will exit the quarter at a more elevated level of e-commerce spend than what we were experiencing going into the crisis. We don't know the extent to which people will fully revert to previous behaviors, but we believe that this is not just about government mandates, it's about public health and taking reasonable precautions in adopting habits that reduce risk that on a relative basis involve minimal sacrifices. In addition, we expect that there will be a slower recovery in verticals with longer lead-time purchases like travel and events, and don't expect any material improvement in the second quarter from the depressed levels that we're seeing now. We will continue to electively help our customers by waiving certain fees, extending credit and offering additional forms of relief. These actions will have an impact on our earnings in the second quarter and are contemplated in the guidance we are providing. Our guidance also assumes no incremental macro adjustment to our reserves for credit losses beyond the increase in Q1. This is dependent upon several macroeconomic factors, which we will continue to monitor and we'll just have to see how this plays out in the quarter. Given the impact to many businesses in the dramatic surge in unemployment, we do not expect that there will be a return to pre-crisis levels of economic growth anytime soon. Overall, we expect underlying non-GAAP earnings growth to be a few points higher than revenue growth, given the dynamics that we're seeing in our business. The flow through on our current mix of volume and the trends in our non-transaction related expenses. At the same time, we're focused on investing in products and services to capitalize on the behavioral shifts we're seeing toward higher e-commerce penetration, the avoidance of cash and a greater desire for contactless payment experiences. The level and extent to which we accelerate investment in these areas will also impact earnings in the quarter. I want to emphasize that trying to forecast at this time, when information and trends are changing rapidly, is exceedingly difficult and we're attempting to balance transparency with reliability. We have a very strong and durable business model, one that stands to benefit from some of the secular trends that may emerge from this crisis. I also want to acknowledge, however, that people are not going to live like this indefinitely; people don't want to live like this indefinitely. Shared experiences are critical to a healthy functioning society and people want to have dinner with friends, travel with family and attend concerts and sporting events. Our April trends demonstrate how we're benefiting from acceleration in e-commerce that has been brought on by much of the world being subject to shelter-in-place. As the world begins to normalize, the behavioral changes that we're seeing may also recede a bit, which will slow our growth in some areas. At the same time, other areas of our business would strengthen as we benefit from having a diversified portfolio of products and services. To be very clear though, we all look forward to moving beyond this moment and taking everything that we have learned to better serve our customers. In closing, in the face of one of the most significant financial shocks that we've seen in our lifetime, our business is more relevant than ever before. If this situation continues for some time, then we're positioned very well. If, however, we can return to normalcy albeit with some notable changes in consumer behavior, then we're also positioned very well. We will continue to take a long-term view in managing our business and we will take actions that we believe will further increase shareholder value and allow us to emerge from this as an even better company with better growth opportunities and more durable earnings. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. HeathTerry: Great. Thank you, Dan, John. I appreciate all the additional disclosure. When you look at the profile of the new users that you've seen added to the platform in April, what kind of commonalities do you see? Why weren't these people already PayPal users? How do you see them engaging with the platform compared to your existing customers? Are they more peer-to-peer, more e-commerce, more frequent? And I realize this isn't a fair question, but how do you see them staying engaged on the platform beyond the current crisis? DanSchulman: Yes. Hey, Heath, it's Dan. I'll take a stab at that and John may have some color commentary afterwards. I think it's a great question. We obviously are seeing a surge in net new actives and that continues on. Just as example, yesterday, we put on 295,000 net new actives. And so this is continuing to be quite sustainable over the past six weeks or so and we are really seeing the majority of these net new actives come out of what we would call are core markets. It's really Western Europe, the U.S., Australia, obviously all areas of the world are growing, but those are the ones that are growing the fastest where we have strong brand attributes. There is a real flight to quality, to trusted brands right now and we are seeing this not just on P2P but across really checkout services, really it's pretty broad based. We're also seeing new segments of customers come in. We're seeing like older cohorts come in, calling it, silver tech, let's just say, those who are older or haven't used PayPal before and now are using it as their kids and family members are explaining to them how to use the service. When we look at engagement and this is a really important question you asked about cohorts in here. What we really look at and our best indicator of lifetime value as well as propensity to stay with us and not to churn is what we call our 10-day adoption rate, and that is within the first 10 days of somebody signing on that they do three or more transactions with PayPal, three or more. And so when we find when they do that, they're just a lifelong PayPal customer. And we've seen with these new cohorts and these new cohorts are pretty huge right now, it could be by the end of the quarter like 6% of our total base for instance, just in the quarter. And so these new cohorts are experiencing a 30% lift in adoption, three uses or more in the first 10 days. And so we feel really good about the cohorts that are coming on. But very importantly, and I think I mentioned this in my script, across our entire base, right now we are seeing our daily active users, daily, grow by 20%. And so this is leading to this explosion in transaction volume that I talked about where you're seeing transactions not just at these all-time levels right now, but if you look at the shape of that through the month of April from the beginning of April to the end of April, our number of daily transactions on a seven-day moving average has grown by 25%. And so you really get a sense of the momentum that's building, and look, I think John said, it's early, we've got six weeks of trends going right now. But our view is we think we are hitting a tipping point across the world where people are seeing just how simple and easy it is to use digital payments to pay for services. This isn't a matter of when to shelter-in-place restrictions start to drop, because this is about health, this is about people not wanting to be in-stores, not wanting to shop. In fact, there is one survey after another that shows that people are more inclined now to do online than to go back in-store. One last thing, we track transactions in TPV by country and by state. And so we see where countries have like Germany or Austria where they've released some of these restrictions over the past two to three weeks and we see no meaningful difference in the amount of usage for their online behavior significantly elevated levels 2 times to 3 times that of pre-COVID. So I hope that's helpful and giving you color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien Huang with JPMorgan. TienTsinHuang: Hi, thanks. Lots of really interesting data here. Thanks for sharing it all. I just wanted to ask on the guidance for the second quarter, it looks like as you said April running plus 20% on revenues, your second quarter guide implies quite a bit of deceleration in May and June. So how much of that is just conservatism as opposed to, the way to ask it, I assume the acceleration April includes boarding new clients as well as perhaps the temporary surge from existing clients that you suggested John might revert now. So just trying to be clear on what the assumption what's conservatism versus what you actually see? Thanks. JohnRainey: You bet, Tianjin. It's good to speak with you. I can't underscore enough how difficult it's been to forecast during this time period. As we got into March and we saw the trends, they were almost cross currents, where parts of our business around travel and events were going one way while we saw the beginning stages of a sharp acceleration and the growth or the increase in e-commerce going in a positive direction. And some of that went into April and we - obviously April was a really good month and let me underscore this point, like the 20% revenue growth that's against the backdrop where we have a vertical like travel and events, which is a high-single digit percentage of our overall portfolio, that is down 80% to 90% year-over-year. So that tells you how strong the rest of the business is. But what we don't know is how long these measures stay in place, right. And what is the consumer behavior, the stickiness to that. I think we've seen Dan talked about some of the customer surveys. We've seen that as many as one-third of customers now say that they will continue to buy groceries online, as an example, and I think once you go through that experience and you realize that you don't get the wilted letters that it's actually quite good, then you continue that. And so there is some expectation around that, but as I noted in my remarks, people want to socialize, they want to go out and do things. And so I think there is a balance between that demand with the concern that people have around health and safety. And so when we look at the rest of the quarter, we expect that there could be some decline. It might be more on the conservative side, obviously if these trends continued, will beat 20% for the quarter, but that's not what we're assuming. I think as it relates to that to Tianjin, one of the things we didn't comment on was our medium-term guidance and we're not changing that at this point. There is again a lot of uncertainty. We don't know what the macroeconomic backdrop is going to look like six months from now, much less two years from now. And so there is I guess cause for concern there. At the same point in time, a lot of the things that we're seeing in our business are positives that are perhaps secular shifts that, as Dan noted, could fast forward where we are by a matter of years. And so I think there are some pluses and minuses to that and we've got no change to that at this point in time. TienTsinHuang: Got it. Makes a lot of sense. I wish you could tell me my kids are going to have summer school or not. So I wish you guys [Multiple Speakers] DanSchulman: Yes. They're not. TienTsinHuang: I know. Don't remind me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. HarshitaRawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. John, can you expand upon your comment around your exposure to different verticals, you already gave a little bit of indications on exposure to travel and events vertical. But I was also thinking about different areas within e-retails, discretionary versus non-discretionary e-commerce. And then just as a follow up, obviously the current situation is very fluid but as you look to your internal scenario then on a downturn, what could that look like to PayPal given the puts and takes around our e-commerce accelerating but then you also have exposure to discretionary spend credit, etc.? Thank you. JohnRainey: Sure, Harshita. So there is a lot to that. I'll try to be as succinct as possible here. So let me first address the verticals and then talk about the discretionary nature of this. March was interesting in terms of how that unfolded and it mirrored society, right. So the first thing that people did was stop traveling internationally and then domestically and they stopped going to large social events, and that had a negative impact on our business. And then when - the compulsory shelter-in-place measures were put in place, that's when we started to see more of the trends that around elevated levels of e-commerce. And as we look at how that continued through the back half of March and into April, it's quite interesting when you look at it on a vertical analysis. So groceries, for example, which is a relatively small part of our overall portfolio, but that has consistently been up 100% plus year-over-year. Other things like electronics and fashion home and garden all verticals that somewhere between 50% to 80% up year-over-year. The areas where we've seen pressure obviously travel and events. Services is another one as one would I think easily understand given the impacts of COVID. And as we move forward and we think about how that unfolds, well obviously as these measures are relaxed like it's going to take some time to book a trip to go on vacation. So there is going to be a slower recovery with some of those verticals where we've seen greater drop-offs in volume. But we also - and as consistent in the previous answer to Heath, we are clearly seeing some stickiness to some of these behaviors. One of the things that we've looked at very closely is like Germany and Austria, that were earlier than some of the other areas or regions of the world in relaxing their shelter-in-place or social distancing measures and we're seeing the same trends continue. And Dan mentioned this, literally a 2 times to 3 times the growth rate that we were seeing pre-crisis. Now again it's early on, and I think quite probably too early to declare these as trends that are definitely sustainable, but there are truly some cross currents in our business that we think that are pretty positive. With respect to - maybe I'll kind of take the last two parts of your question together, like the discretionary versus non-discretionary nature of PayPal and how that may impact or be impacted in a recession. Look, the PayPal up 15 years ago when someone was using us to buy baseball cards on eBay is very different today. We're not necessarily just discretionary services. People use us; use our platform to pay rent. They use us to do bill pay. They use us for subscriptions for regular monthly services. And so obviously we're tied to personal consumption and would expect some impact on our business in a recession, but these are not just discretionary items, these are must haves for many people. DanSchulman: Yes, I'd just add to that. So I'll give you one example. Just one of our services Xoom, which is our international remittance service, people aren't going into physical locations anymore to give money and to - and somebody in the receiving end going to a specific co-location to get money. So we have seen a 400% increase in people using Xoom, net new actives coming on the Xoom since the January, February timeframe. And here's the thing about using Xoom, first of all, it is a critical service, people send money home every single month, sometimes twice a month. Once you use Xoom versus a traditional method, you are never going back, it is half as expensive, it is faster, it is easier to go and do. And so - and the same thing with Honey. Honey is experiencing the same sort of dramatic increases, up 180% in net new actives, revenues growing substantially and that wasn't a year-over-year, when I said 40%, that was 40% more than in January and February in terms of their revenues. And I think the products and services and capabilities that we've put together are crucial now for both merchants and for consumers, and we are seeing merchants of all sizes come to us now with strategic conversations we've never seen before. These are now merchants that are reassessed - reassessing how they are going to do commerce thinking now about digital and online, first; physical locations, second. You've never really seen that in any kind of scale at the retail level. It's a fundamental rethink and we're with the scale and scope and scale of consumers and merchants and scope of services I think we're more relevant and more important than we've ever been before. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. BryanKeane: Hi, guys. Just wanted to get a clarification April TPV is up 22% revenues, 20%, so it's pretty tightly correlated. So I just want to make sure I understand that the stronger yields are probably due to PayPal branding and lower Braintree and P2P volumes? And then secondly, John, any help you can give us on credit provisions on how to think about that going forward, what might cause further write-downs? Thanks so much. JohnRainey: Sure, Bryan. And you're correct. I think it is partly the mix in our business. It's also that we've seen a rebound in cross-border, which tends to have higher take rates as well. On CECL or the new accounting standard for credit losses, let me just explain a little bit there for the benefit of everyone what's changed versus the previous accounting method. So under the prior incurred loss model, we would recognize losses as we begin to see those in our book. The new standard now requires companies to recognize those losses on the entirety of those losses, their expected losses, when things such as macroeconomic events change that they think will give rise to those losses. And so the charge that we took in the first quarter was our best guess at that point in time of the entirety of those losses, and so it's not as if we were saving any to recognize at a later period. Now things could obviously change and we would take that information into account and need to recognize something higher or lower as the case may be related to that, if we had that information, but there is I think also a little bit of subjectivity that goes into that as well. I will say that if you look at our coverage ratio. So the percentage of reserves that we have related to the gross amount on our balance sheet, we're at 17%, which for those of you who follow some of the other issuers, that puts us at the higher or more conservative range that exist out there. But I think just to put this in context though, we have consistently said that we don't want to be too levered, too credit to where we go through a business cycle like what we're seeing now. And that disrupt the durability of our earnings. And so in the quarter, we took a $237 million charge related to this. To put that into context, we had $1.3 billion in free cash flow and we're still reporting a 20% operating margin even with that charge. And so we think that this is something that is being managed appropriately well in terms of the risk mitigation here, and we'll obviously keep an eye on that as we go through the balance of the year, but the first quarter charge included our best estimate at that point in time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead. AshwinShirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Dan. Hi, John. Good to hear your voices. I appreciate the good work you're doing as an organization. My question - sure my question is on PayPal, sorry on Venmo. Can you quantitatively parse the Venmo performance, it looks as though there is a combination of new use cases and also looks like the use of Venmo for may be direct purchases might have risen sharply while maybe the traditional use case of post-purchase sharing has waned in the current shelter-in-place. So any parsing that you can provide? DanSchulman: Yes. Maybe I'll take a stab at that and then John can - I mean first of all, Venmo is participating in those record net new actives that we're seeing and had an incredible month, in the month of April. And when I talked about highest transactions ever on May 1 for the company, it is also the highest transactions ever for Venmo as well, just to give you an idea of Venmo. Venmo TPV in Q1, it grew at 48%. By the way, January and February is well over 50%, what happened in March, it's interesting to your point about new use cases. Venmo is a very much of a social payments service, you go out to dinner or to bar with friends and you split the bill and do that kind of thing. Well, all of that dropped away obviously as everybody went to shelter-in-place. But basically Venmo incredibly rapidly morphed into additional use cases because P2P now is very much at the core of what people are doing. Bryan, you asked before how much of this change is coming from P2P or Braintree, it's really predominantly Braintree in terms of the mix. P2P is actually growing in many different use cases. We're now seeing entire families using Venmo, because the kids are on it. They've got a sense while their parents are back and forth and so it's becoming a cross-generational platform and it is being used to pay for goods and services right now. We are seeing a real significant increase in Pay with Venmo. It's going to be one of these things that accelerate Pay with Venmo quite substantially. We're seeing its QR code for instance being used to pick up goods at curb side, at Farmers Markets. It's being used now by artists, by musicians, by yoga instructors and many others to pay for online classes that are going on. We're seeing a real explosion from people donating directly to charities to doing things now over Venmo. And so - and by the way as a result of that as you probably saw, we raised the limits on Venmo up to 5,000 a week. Now, we were able to do that because as John pointed out in his remarks, our fraud and risk modeling is at all-time best capabilities, the entire Venmo platform from a fraud and risk perspective is now on the PayPal platform. And so we were able to take up limits, because we had to - because people were bumping up against those limits because of there is no new use cases. We put on things like direct deposit, so people can put their paycheck directly on to Venmo because they're using it now in all these different ways and so that they could receive their stimulus check right into their Venmo wallet as well. So it's been really interesting to watch the evolution of Venmo become much more central to people's management and movement of money instead of just being a social payment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. JasonKupferberg: Hey, how are you guys? Hope you're doing well. I just wanted to start with - I just wanted to start out with kind of a longer-term question and Dan you touched on this a little bit, but just as we think about the structural lift in a post-COVID world to your business and how do we actually cross reference that with that medium-term guidance, which John, I know you spoke to briefly mid-20s TPV growth I think is where we've kind of left off on that, and even in an environment where the significant categories are down tremendously, you ran at the low 20s in the month of April. So it kind of sounds like you think structurally mid 20%s is may be too low, but just any thoughts on that without putting specific numbers on it? Would love some perspective. And then can you just make a quick comment on net adds for the year, because I think you were forecasting 35 million and it looks like you'll be upwards of 30 million at the halfway point? DanSchulman: Yes. Okay, there are a lot of questions. So let me take a stab at some of them and then of course, John will come in as well. I think John put it well in his opening remarks as well as his answers to some of the questions. There are clearly secular shifts that have accelerated. There is no question about it. E-commerce has accelerated by two, three years. And people may not be at these incredibly elevated levels, but they are going to be at elevated levels coming out of it. You're going to see people doing digital payments truly omni. It's going to happen online than offline. The digital wallet is going to become much more important. We'll be adding more and more services to that as rapidly as we can, because people are now - want to use PayPal much more frequently. We're seeing a lot more daily usage of it. That's always been our aspiration to be a daily use case. And so I would say we are structurally much more bullish on our growth profile going forward, and I think there are more tailwinds than we've seen before. To John's point though, we live in an uncertain environment right now. There is a lot of economic unknowns and so we - though you expect us to be thoughtful about guides that we're giving and how we're thinking about it. Clearly, we prefer to be on the more conservative side than not. And so let's wait a little bit to see how these trends play out, but you could see some really nice trends, and by the way, we're not just going to - we're going to double down on those trends too. I think we're going to help drive those trends and we are investing as John said to make those things happen. In terms of net new actives, yes, I mean we're all going to really need to rethink all of that. I talked about we're going to do 15 million to 20 million this quarter. I think that's a good reasonable estimate on that and we did 10 million organic in the first quarter. And so likely going to be higher than what we had initially been thinking, but again let us get through this quarter and then we'll update you on that. John, anything else you would - JohnRainey: Yes. Maybe I'd just emphasize a point that you made, Dan. Certainly, I don't think any of us can predict what's going to happen in the economy in the near term and that happens - that has obviously an impact on our annual numbers. But you asked a question, Jason, are we structurally more bullish on PayPal. With the emphasis on structurally, I would say we are unequivocally more structurally bullish on PayPal. The time frame that happens - DanSchulman: John to say that it's something - I just would point out [Multiple Speakers] JasonKupferberg: Maybe this is going to be conservative ones or? DanSchulman: Yes. I supposed by me that says. JohnRainey: But you know I think the other point Dan I mentioned is we're not just going to sit back and let this happen to us. This is our moment we recognize that we have an opportunity to shape the outcome here. And so we're pivoting strategies to help influence what that looks like. But - and I also don't want to, I think we should be cognizant of what's happening in the world and the severe stress that people are under and are going through and people losing their jobs. And so we should not lose sight of that, but there are some fundamental shifts in how people are behaving that we think in order to our benefit longer term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. GeorgeMihalos: Thanks for taking my question guys and hope you're all doing well. Just want to go back to this point around more sort of non-discretionary spend that I'm just curious, since the COVID presented itself, are you have more conversations or are you seeing more merchants in sort of this non-discretionary category, grocery, pharmacy, bill pay, reaching out to PayPal wanting now to partner with you guys. And then somewhat related to that the ramp of payment and how is that going and should we expect again to see additional bill pay partners going forward? DanSchulman: Yes. So George, I'll begin the answer at least. Clearly, we are seeing merchants across the world reach out to us to help them think about moving more aggressively digitally and also importantly omni. We're seeing I think some largest supermarket in France reach out to us around groceries to really do much more contactless payment and seamless kind of offline, online this merger of those, but we're seeing merchants everywhere going to do that. In terms of Bill Pay, we have a very aggressive plan and partnership with Paymentus that's going quite well. But there are a host of other bill pay providers who want to partner with us and will partner with us as we integrate all of those into Bill Pay components in our wallet. I do think our wallet is going to expand in terms of the services it provides. Honey will be integrated into that we are seeing really nice progress on this. I just would say this whole work from home - we're seeing actually an increase in the velocity of releases - software releases that we've been able to do, I'm really impressed with what George and Ryan and the team at Honey have been able to go and do to react so quickly to the need of the time right now. And as John said, we want to shape this. We certainly have no shortage of people who are looking at PayPal in a whole different way right now and want to much more deeply partner with us. I mentioned some of those in my remarks, so I think we're at this interesting point in time where our relevance and our importance as a company is at this inflection point, and we really want to do everything we can to double down on that. John, anything you would like to add? JohnRainey: Nothing more to add. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. DavidTogut: Thank you, guys. Good to hear your voices, Dan and John. As you look at the acceleration in the net new actives for Honey in April. To what extent is that acceleration in Honey KPIs driven by the benefit from being in the PayPal ecosystem versus this broader search for value with Honey perhaps driving a pickup in net new actives for PayPal ecosystem as a whole? DanSchulman: Yes. So I can't give you exact, but like if I had to give you sort of the general gist of that. I would say the majority is due to the utility of Honey in this environment. It - look Honey is a mission; though it's been about making money fair. It is finding the best price point, understanding demand curves via consumer helping merchants to reach those consumers. And when George and I talked about this early on date, our missions align, but they always said that they thought they were countercyclical, in a down economy their services would be even more important. And John said this, I fully agree with him. Even before this crisis, there was a crisis of underserved communities in our country and around the world. Honey targeted right after that and that's just become more acute. Our cross-selling have been incredibly effective in working with Honey and in fact when we cross sell into Honey, we see a much higher LTV customer as well coming out of both for PayPal and Honey and we are at like the beginnings of that integration. But all the integration we have right now is fully on track, Honey is coming out with a number of new features and services, quite excited about the early test results on them are pretty impressive. So more to come on it, but we are more excited than ever about what we can do with Honey and the capabilities that they provide to consumers and merchants. DavidTogut: Okay, thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, what's your expectation for the growth trajectory of Honey going forward? JohnRainey: It's - we're not going to parse out elements of our platform and give the full year guidance on that. But I will tell you that, year-to-date, it is performing according to the plan that we had. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. LisaEllis: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Good to hear your voices. Both of you have mentioned that you're pivoting your strategy to shape the evolution of consumer and merchant behavior through this situation, so that PayPal emerge as strong than ever. Can you elaborate on that a bit like specifically how you adjusted your investment priorities, given this dramatic shift we're seeing in consumer behavior, like what initiatives are you pulling forward? What things have you may be pushed out or de-prioritized? Thank you. DanSchulman: Yes, sure. Good to hear your voice too, Lisa. So there are obviously I think are number of different trends that are happening as a result of COVID physical to digital and that blurring of that and that's across retail services, entertainment, education, medicine. That's a trend that is occurring hyper-speed. There is obviously this whole thing that John talked about. This isn't just about relaxing shelter-in-place, this is about health, hygiene, social distancing, people don't want to touch cash, something like 60% of our people want to handle cash a lot lesser $18 trillion of cash transactions last year at retail. And so they don't want to touch cash, they don't want to touch screens. And I don't think we go back to the normal of what was - just going to be a new normal that emerges from that and then obviously, because of the economic environment, we were in before the crisis that's been just exaggerated by the crisis even more is there is a lot of price sensitivity and worries about financial health. And so we think that there are capabilities that we can put into - by the way, Lisa, these things, these trends, we've always said aspirationally we want to have 1 billion people on our platform using it every day. And we think that these trends are incredibly are things that we really need to take double down on and make sure that we shape them because we think that they're very helpful to those aspirations that we have. And so the things that we are doubling down on and accelerating, one are clearly in-store. We have a very large team focused around that. We meet on that every single week. We are looking at that and we have just a cross - the company team, we're calling it one of our moon shots because it's that important to us and we want to - we've always - we're going to go into in-store, we are now accelerating that and much more globally. We want to go into everyday use cases in the digital wallet. We'll try to accelerate. I don't want to talk specifically to give away any competitive information, but obviously we're running great things like Bill Pay other types of budgeting tools and that kind of thing into our wallet. We want to integrate Honey as rapidly as possible, because this entire thought about being much more part of the shopping journey is important for our consumers and increasingly so for our merchants. And so these are just a couple of the things. We're also focusing in on P2P services in general. P2P is becoming much more central to people's lives and so we are really looking at a number of ways to increase the utility of P2P. And so I would say those are a couple of the big things that we're looking at. We basically now are rallying around five things as a company that we want to get done and get done in a big way to take advantage of this moment in time where consumers and merchants most need our services and products. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session. That is all the time we had for today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan for any closing remarks. Dan Schulman : Yes. Thanks so much. I'd just close up by one, thanking everybody for your time and again reiterating that we hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. We really look forward to being able to see all of you in person again. We may have masks on. But we look forward to seeing all of you again. Thank you for your time. Take care, bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.  With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. And I hope that all of you are safe and well. I'm pleased to say that PayPal just had its strongest quarter since becoming an independent public company 5 years ago. Simply put, our business has never been more relevant and important than it is today. In the midst of the COVID pandemic, we have seen substantial macro changes that we believe will have a lasting and profoundly positive impact on our business. The world has accelerated from physical to digital across multiple industries, including retail. Merchants are embracing a digital-first strategy, and these trends have fueled the rapid rise of digital payments. These are durable and meaningful tailwinds, and we are fortunate to have the scale, scope of services and brand reputation to capture the benefits of these trends and extend them to our customers. Consumer behavior has shifted in a discontinuous manner, and PayPal clearly has a unique opportunity to accelerate its path to becoming an everyday essential service.  The strength that we saw across our business in April continued to gain momentum throughout Q2. Our transactions grew by 26% to 3.7 billion, consistently rivaling the volumes that we usually experience during the 5 days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. Transactions on our PayPal Checkout experiences remained especially strong, growing almost 40% year-over-year. TPV grew at 30% on an FX-neutral basis, with a record $222 billion of processed volume in Q2. TPV accelerated throughout the quarter, and June marked our highest growth rate since our separation from eBay.  We added a record 21.3 million new customers in the quarter, increasing nearly 140% year-over-year. To put this in perspective, this quarter's net new actives were greater than our total net new actives in 2016. Nearly 1.7 million merchants signed up for PayPal in Q2, and Honey net new actives were nearly 3x that of Q1. Importantly, we continue to see increased levels of engagement. Our 10-day adoption rate for our newest cohorts grew by 20% to 30% over last year. And across our PayPal base, our daily active users have accelerated by almost 40% from last year. We ended Q2 with 346 million active accounts and with over 26 million merchant accounts. Given our momentum, I believe that we will add approximately 70 million net new actives this year.  These trends drove record financial performance in the quarter. Revenues grew by 25% on an FX-neutral basis to $5.26 billion, accelerating after our strong 20% revenue growth in April. This is the first time our quarterly revenues have exceeded $5 billion. Due to the strength of our PayPal-branded transactions, our non-GAAP operating margin increased by a record 500 basis points to 28% this quarter. As a result, our non-GAAP EPS grew by 49% year-over-year to $1.07. And all of this led to record free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the quarter, up 112%.  In the first half of 2020, the penetration of e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales outpaced prior external forecast by an astonishing 3 to 5 years. In this environment, the demand for our products and services has dramatically increased and unleashed multiple opportunities. We are focused on several key initiatives to fully leverage this unique moment in time. First and foremost is our push to accelerate in-store contactless payments. Both consumers and merchants are rapidly moving towards digital payments across their online and off-line experiences. This is an existential issue for merchants who realized that reopening their retail stores depends on touchless forms of payments to keep both their employees and customers safe and healthy. There are numerous market research studies highlighting that consumers no longer want to handle cash or other forms of payments that require any physical touch at checkout. We are significantly investing to accelerate our presence in all forms of omnichannel commerce, from point-of-sale in-store to buy online and pick up in store, order ahead, pay at table and home delivery. In addition to iZettle contactless cards and integration with both Google Pay and Samsung Pay, we announced that our QR code functionality is now available across 28 countries for small and micro merchants. And we are working with leading retailers throughout the U.S. and Europe to aggressively roll out an integrated point-of-sale QR solution beginning this quarter with expansion planned throughout the year.  For instance, we are working with CVS Pharmacy to enable PayPal and Venmo QR codes for payment at their cash registers. And we expect a full national rollout to their 8,200 stand-alone store locations by the end of the year. Our merchants and our consumers want us to expand in store, and we will not let this opportunity pass us by. The rollout of QR functionality will also accelerate our Venmo monetization efforts. Venmo also had a very strong Q2 with record NNAs and an active base that now exceeds 60 million consumers. In Q2, Venmo grew its TPV by 52% to almost $37 billion. Revenues continue to outperform our expectations with year-over-year growth rates of greater than 60% during the first 3 weeks of July. We are seeing substantial increases in the use of Venmo as the pandemic continues on as more consumers turn to Venmo to live their financial lives, including adoption of direct deposit functionality, and later this year, the Venmo credit card.  We recently introduced business profiles, a unique new way for consumers and merchants to connect on Venmo and exchange goods and services with the same protections enjoyed by PayPal customers. These initiatives will drive significant additional value to Venmo users and consequently drive new vectors of monetization.  We are also expanding functionality beyond omni checkout in both our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets. We will roll out additional services over the next several quarters, including bill pay, subscriptions and rewards management, shopping tools from Honey and new forms of credit and budgeting tools, to name just a few. Our goal is to meaningfully expand the range of services provided inside our wallets. We believe these and other actions will bring us closer to having a full set of capabilities for consumers to use on a daily basis. Our rapidly increasing scale makes us highly relevant to merchants of all sizes and provides us with large sets of data to offer customized services and solutions. Over the last few years, we have developed, acquired and grown a strong and diverse portfolio of capabilities that address many of the current needs of our merchants. These range from end-to-end digital payment processing to sophisticated risk management and shopping tools that ultimately help to drive increased sales and engagement so that our merchants can thrive in the era of digital commerce. And it's the combination of these assets together that provides unique competitive differentiation for our enterprise merchants, channel partners and small business customers. Providing merchants with a comprehensive, consistent, simple and unified experience remains a guiding principle for us as we continue to add new products and services. And as is evident by the number of merchants signing up for PayPal, our integrated platform has never been more relevant or needed.  We continue to extend our platform capabilities around the world. We recently entered into an important commercial relationship with Gojek, a leader in mobile commerce in Southeast Asia with 170 million users. In Brazil and Mexico, PayPal is available as a payment option in the Mercado Pago online checkout for shoppers. And PayPal is now available for cross-border transactions on MercadoLibre. And we continue to build our team and capabilities in China as we integrate with our GoPay platform, partner with China UnionPay and other leading Chinese players.  COVID-19 was not the only set of issues we addressed this quarter. As all of you know, we are witnessing an outpouring of emotion and determination to address centuries of systemic racism. In June, we announced a comprehensive $530 million commitment to support black and minority businesses and to fight economic inequality. We felt it was necessary to not just condemn racism, but to commit to doing the necessary work over the long term to help create a more socially just society. Even as we navigate these unprecedented times as a business, we have the ability to act in a way that clearly represents our values, especially around inclusion. We still have lots of work to do, but we are fully committed to a future where all people can live with dignity and respect.  This is also a special quarter for PayPal because it marks our fifth anniversary as an independent publicly traded company. During that time, we've dramatically expanded our platform capabilities, value proposition, geographic footprint and our market leadership. However, I believe the next 5 years will bring about even greater opportunities. We have an ambitious vision for PayPal to be a central player in the future of the digital economy. I'm confident we can drive towards that goal. We have a solid track record and an unwavering dedication to delivering essential, differentiated and best-in-class services to merchants and consumers. This is our time, and we intend to seize the moment. Our products and services have never been more important, and we are ready and well positioned to capture the opportunities that lie ahead of us. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John? John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their efforts to serve our customers and execute on our priorities during these unprecedented times. Since our last earnings call, the encouraging business trends that we've called out have persisted, and we're reporting the strongest quarterly results in our history.  As Dan discussed, in the current operating environment, our business has inherent advantages. By many estimates, the pace of e-commerce penetration has accelerated by several years in a single quarter. And there is greater demand for contactless payments than ever before. These shifts play directly to our strengths and will enable us to advance our competitive positioning. At the same time, there is ongoing uncertainty as it relates to both the progression of the coronavirus as well as the state of the macroeconomic environment. We are carefully monitoring the pace of recovery and these interconnected dynamics. This overall level of macro-related uncertainty has resulted in increased complexity in building our forecast. It is with this backdrop that we're updating you today on our business and our outlook for the remainder of the year.  Our second quarter performance highlights the benefits of PayPal's diversification and scale and our resulting earnings power. We delivered 25% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, 49% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share and generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow. We did all of this while absorbing ongoing pressure from reduced travel and event spending and lower revenue from our credit products. I'll now provide the details of our financial performance for the quarter and then our expectations for the rest of the year.  Revenue in the second quarter increased 25% on a currency-neutral basis to $5.26 billion. Transaction revenue grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis, the strongest growth we've ever reported. Growth accelerated 13 points year-over-year and 15 points sequentially. Transaction revenue growth was primarily driven by strength across our PayPal Checkout experiences, which more than offset the approximately 60% decline we saw within our travel and advanced volumes. For context, travel and events represented slightly more than 10% of our TPV in the second quarter last year. In addition, cross-border volumes increased 24% in the quarter, which also supported transaction revenue growth. Other value-added services revenue declined 26%. Lower credit revenue in the quarter resulted from a number of factors. These included customer relief actions, fewer merchant loan originations, the lapping of $58 million of interim servicing revenue from Synchrony recognized in Q2 last year, and an approximate $17 million impact from increased expected credit loss provisions related to macroeconomic adjustments. Lower interest income due to lower interest rates globally also contributed to this decline. Revenue from Honey, also part of this line item, only partially offset these headwinds in the quarter.  In the second quarter, transaction take rate was 2.23%, and total take rate was 2.37%. Compared to the second quarter last year, these declined 2 basis points and 13 basis points, respectively. Transaction take rate increased sequentially, and excluding the effect of person-to-person volumes, increased year-over-year as well, reflecting strong volume growth from PayPal checkout experiences.  Moving to our volume-based expenses. As the rate of TPV, we're reporting record low transaction expense and transaction loss performance. Transaction expense was 83 basis points as a rate of TPV, a decline of 11 basis points versus Q2 last year, primarily due to the funding mix on our platform in the quarter. Transaction loss was 12 basis points, an improvement of 2 basis points year-over-year and the fifth consecutive quarter in which we performed in this range. Risk mitigation strategies and risk model enhancements continue to drive this improved loss experience across our platform. Together, transaction expense and transaction loss provided 335 basis points of leverage. At the same time, given current economic forecast, we increased our macro-related reserves for expected credit losses by $117 million. This flows directly to our income statement, increasing credit losses by $100 million and reducing other value-added services revenue by $17 million. After taxes, this adjustment to our provision represented a $0.07 per share impact to earnings.  Entering the quarter, our reserve coverage was 17%. With this additional increase in our reserve, we exited the quarter at 22% coverage. Overall, the combination of our strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 26% to approximately $3 billion. Our transaction margin expanded 179 basis points to 56.6%. 335 basis points of margin expansion from transaction expense and transaction loss was partially offset by 156 basis points of deleverage from loan losses. Nontransaction-related expenses increased by 10%, resulting in 326 basis points of leverage. Customer support and operations as a line item contributed more than 40% of this leverage. Excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, nontransaction-related expenses increased 3% or only $0.04 for every incremental dollar of revenue, once again, demonstrating the scalability of our business and our operating discipline.  Operating margin for the quarter was 28.2%, improving more than 500 basis points year-over-year, the highest level of operating margin expansion we reported in our history. Strength across all parts of our business contributed to this performance. Non-GAAP other income in the quarter declined by $60 million relative to last year, predominantly driven by increased interest expense from a higher debt balance and reduced interest income from lower interest rates. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 49% to $1.07. Our earnings performance demonstrates our ability to successfully execute in the face of a more challenging operating environment as well as the strength and resilience of our platform. Excluding the macro-related charge for expected credit losses, non-GAAP EPS would have increased 59%. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.2 billion. In May, we raised $4 billion in long-term debt with a weighted average effective interest rate of 2.26%. We ended the quarter with $9 million in long-term debt. In addition, we generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter or approximately $0.42 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. And year-over-year, free cash flow grew 112%. We're very well positioned from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective. This solid footing gives us the flexibility to successfully navigate this environment and emerge stronger. We've identified several opportunities to accelerate our long-term growth and advance our leadership position in digital payments. As a result, in the back half of the year, we plan to invest heavily in support of these plans, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  I now want to shift to our expectations for the rest of 2020. With more than half of the year behind us, our strong results and ongoing momentum as well as the secular tailwinds that have accelerated this year, we are reinstating our full year guidance. While the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to economic recovery remain unclear, we have more visibility and confidence in our trajectory for the remainder of 2020. Our updated full year outlook is a significant raise relative to our prior guidance for revenue, earnings and free cash flow. For the back half of the year, our overall expectations are that TPV and revenue will perform in line with the second quarter, with 30% volume growth and 25% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. We also believe non-GAAP EPS will grow approximately 25% on a spot basis in both Q3 and Q4, based on the strong leverage we're seeing and our investment plans. As a result of these expectations, for the full year, on a currency-neutral basis, we now expect TPV to grow in the high 20s percentage range and revenue to grow approximately 22%. In addition, for the full year, we now expect to grow non-GAAP EPS in the range of 25%. I'd also like to note that included in this guidance for 25% EPS growth is our expectation that the other income line item will reflect a net expense for the year, given lower interest rates on our corporate cash and the debt we've recently raised.  Relative to the guidance we provided in January, our updated guidance represents a raise of approximately 3.5 points of growth to revenue and 9 points of growth to earnings. In addition, we now expect to generate more than $5 billion of free cash flow this year, an increase of $1 billion relative to our prior guidance. I'd like to give some context for this improved outlook.  The revenue growth we expect reflects continued strong performance in transaction revenue, partially offset by ongoing pressure in our credit products. It also reflects a 1-point headwind to growth from the eBay managed payments migration. The rate of growth we're expecting for the year represents a 7-point acceleration from 2019 and is indicative of the elevated and sustained engagement we're seeing across our platform. In addition, we now expect our operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points relative to our prior guidance that would have been flat versus last year. Based on the mix of transaction volume and our strong business trends, we expect to continue to show transaction margin expansion throughout the rest of the year.  At the same time, included in this guidance and partially offsetting transaction margin expansion are our plans to invest approximately $300 million in the back half of the year to advance our key priorities and accelerate our growth initiatives. We believe that we have a unique opportunity to strengthen our competitive positioning and extend our leadership. We've never been more relevant to our customers around the world, and we're focused on doubling down in several areas to help ensure that we sustain and enhance our strategic advantages. This is quite costly an inflection point in the growth of e-commerce and digital payments. And as a result, we're electing to invest much of our margin improvement to help ensure our long-term success. We believe that the guidance we're providing today is consistent with the significant advantages from which our business is currently benefiting.  Relative to when we last reported earnings nearly 3 months ago, we have more confidence in the sustainability of the elevated e-commerce trends we are seeing. When it first felt like a potentially short-lived phenomenon resulting from initial panic and pantry packing and even stimulus checks, has become a much more durable and profound behavioral shift. We've seen the strongest and most encouraging new customer volume and engagement trends in our history. At the same time, given our exposure to travel and live events, we've watched demand in these verticals essentially grind to a halt. Our business has demonstrated its ability to withstand exogenous shocks. And the diversity and scale of our platform is allowing us to outperform even while absorbing meaningful pressures.  Three months ago, the idea that our PayPal-branded experiences would enjoy TPV growth for an entire quarter at a level consistent with and only previously seen during high-velocity holiday selling days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday was bold and even somewhat inconceivable, especially in the midst of a global pandemic and the highest levels of unemployment in our lifetime. And while we know more today than we did a few months ago about both the virus and the economy, there continues to be palpable uncertainty. As we sit here today, the concept of normalcy is being redefined, and at times, feel elusive. What we do know is that this is a pivotal moment in PayPal's history. We believe that we've never been better positioned to realize our ambition for greater relevance, ubiquity and impact as a global payments leader. We recognize that this is our time to capitalize on our strategic position and financial capacity to serve our customers better and to advance our platform, and we're committed to achieving our full potential.  In addition, through this period, we've learned a lot about our organization and its resiliency and what we can accomplish when we're focused on delivering against a defined set of key objectives. We're committed to continuing to support our employees, our customers and our communities through these challenging times and to create sustainable long-term value for all of our stakeholders.  I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Really terrific results here. Just trying to think about what to ask upfront here. But with -- you've got record new adds, volume, engagement numbers, all great. So is there a way to maybe hone in on what changed since April? What's driving the performance? If you had to rank the biggest factors, enough to give you confidence to reinstate guidance and call for sustainability in the third quarter in relation to what we talked about last quarter. I'm just trying to maybe summarize that, if you don't mind. Daniel Schulman : Yes, sure. I'll take the crack at that. So obviously, our best quarter by far, both on the NNAs and engagement, particularly, just to give you some color around it, Tien-Tsin, 21.3 million, you knew what April was, but May and June were equally strong in our net new actives, and these are high-quality LTV NNAs that come from our core markets around the world.  Merchants were up about 3x what we typically see. This is really a reflection of industries moving towards digital-first strategies. We see that continuing. Honey, I talked about being up 3x Q1. It's got the perfect value proposition for these economic times. Venmo obviously had a record NNA quarter. Xoom, which we didn't talk about last time, Xoom, which has a great value proposition. Xoom NNAs were up over 600% in Q2 versus Q1. And because of all of that, we're beginning -- continuing to see substantial year-over-year growth, and we believe we'll add about 70 million NNAs, which is at least double what we typically do in a year.  On the engagement side, I think it's possibly even better news than the NNA side. We look at 10-day engagement for our new cohorts. Like how many of our new cohorts are doing 4 or more engagements within the first 10 days. And that's up even further than what we saw in April. That's now up 20% to 30% versus previous cohorts. Our daily active user versus last year is up and consistently so by about 40% versus last year. And our churn, which is a really important number as we think about NNAs going forward, has also meaningfully declined as well.  And so what -- why is all of that happening, I think? And obviously, volumes, I talked about very quickly, but I think what's important on the volumes is that April was our low, June was our high in terms of volume growth. So you can see the acceleration throughout the quarter. And that, by the way, is with travel and ticketing events down 60% or so. And outside that, Braintree is experiencing some of its best growth in a long, long time. So volume continues to accelerate.  But the reason for all this, from my perspective, is the following. First of all, we see a tremendous amount of new cohorts coming in that have never used e-commerce before. That's mostly silver tech. We talked about that. That continues to be the fastest-growing segment of net new actives. We're also seeing a huge amount of new use cases. People are giving in different ways. They're basically doing P2M activities for like workouts that are streaming. We're seeing new industries come on to digital because the digital economy is everything right now. And so you're seeing health care, education, fitness, restaurants, entertainment, all swinging dramatically to online. You're seeing brands now, for the first time, sell directly to consumers online. And verticals that have been online, but people have been experimental with them, like groceries and home and garden, are booming at close to triple-digit percentage growth. And if you look at it from a PayPal-specific basis, with the scale we have now and the corresponding network effects, it's very hard for a merchant not to have PayPal on there. When they have PayPal, they see that the sales lift as a result of that, sometimes up to 50% plus. And by the way, our placement in merchants now is improving as well as they see how critical PayPal is for their sales. And then our brand reputation, the experiences that we're giving, new products and services that we have right now, including QR codes coming out, all of that kind of gives us this confidence, and also that the results we're seeing will be quite resilient as we look forward, which is why we felt comfortable reinstating guidance for the year. John, do you want to maybe add a little bit to that? John Rainey : Yes. So I'll just add one small comment, Tien-Tsin. I think for everyone, the sustainability of these elevated levels of e-commerce and digital payment trends is the big question. And I think one of the things that gives us a little more conviction is we're 3 months further along than we were on the last call. As you've seen, the elevated levels of these trends and particularly in regions that have relaxed some of their shelter-in-place or social distancing measures, and even when consumers are going back to somewhat normal activities like eating out at restaurants or shopping in grocery stores, the level of e-commerce penetration is still much, much higher than what we saw pre-COVID-19. And so I think that's one of the things that we've watched closely that I think is a fairly good indication of the trends going for the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Dan and John, really, really appreciate the level of detail in all of that. To dig into one area, with the eBay expiration, can you update us on the strategy and positioning in marketplaces, particularly how you're servicing some of the faster-growing ones, like Shopify, given what's going on there today. What does the strategic road map look like? And what does it mean for PayPal? Daniel Schulman : Yes. It's a good question, Heath. I'll start off with that. I'd say, first of all, eBay is going to remain a very important customer over the foreseeable future. Jamie and I have had good conversations about that. They've been quite positive. And I thought you saw that reflected in some of his comments yesterday about our partnership. It is what our mutual customers want. And the impact of managed payments has been forecasted by us for quite some time. John mentioned it's part of what we're putting into our guidance for the rest of this year.  And honestly, on that front, from what we see with a very high share of checkout with merchants who have moved to intermediated payments, our checkout share can be from 50% to 75% depending on the country. And when we do research and we do a lot of it with merchants who use both PayPal and eBay, the difference in NPS in terms of how they think about an intermediated approach and the PayPal approach is quite substantial in favor of PayPal. And so we really have seen, obviously, some merchants move, but not a large number to date. And if anything, we're feeling better about our projections than we have, but we're just beginning the end of the operating agreement right now. So we feel comfortable that this is a very manageable transition going forward.  I think your point is a really interesting one about other marketplaces. And if you look at the top 15 marketplaces that we serve today, Shopify being one of them; Etsy, for instance, being another, and you look at their growth rate, the growth rates of all 15 of those marketplaces we're quite close partners with approached 100% in Q2. Yes, it's just amazing growth to go and see that. It was 3x the growth of what we saw on eBay. If you look over the last a year or so, it's something like 7x the growth of eBay. And we have spent a lot of time working with those marketplaces to be quite close partners with them. From Shopify, some others that are just beginning but may have the potential of being meaningful marketplaces like Facebook and Google or Facebook or the underlying payments platform for Facebook Marketplaces and InstaShopping. We just announced a comprehensive partnership with Google, and we are working with other major marketplaces as a result of the expiration of the operating agreement. And so I think it's a huge growth vector for us. We are participating in that growth, and our road map is quite focused on providing additional value-added services for those marketplaces. But things like payouts, which we really have taken a good lead in and other things, are crucial as well as all the regulatory elements around the world that we can provide services and capabilities to those marketplaces because we are a global player. John, anything you'd add on that? John Rainey : No, nothing to add, Dan. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Dan and John, can you elaborate a little bit on the QR code strategy? Specifically, what types of merchants are you targeting? What steps are you taking that are going to drive consumer adoption of actually whipping out the PayPal or Venmo wallet at the physical point of sale? And then what's the monetization strategy for QR? Meaning, in which cases is it monetizable for PayPal versus being a pass through? Daniel Schulman : Yes. I think I'll take the first crack at that. Look, obviously, and you heard this in my remarks upfront, this is a key strategic priority for us. I think it's critical in driving daily use. And we will make the investments we need to do in order to be successful here. This is going to be an ongoing process. We say this doesn't happen overnight in the next quarter or 2, but we have the patience and we have the conviction that this can be a meaningful part of our business as we look over the medium term.  Part of the reason for this is, this is really demand driven. In other words, consumers and merchants are reaching out to us. They are asking us, working with us to implement this, and I'll talk about why that is. But look, 70% of people have health concerns about shopping in person. And of course, they want to use touchless payments in store. Retailers realize that consumers want it. And we are not only rolling out to small and micro merchants across 28 countries. And by the way, seeing very expected but very encouraging growth. Expected because we know that the demand is there. But we are actively working right now, Lisa, with more than 100 large enterprise merchants across the U.S. and Europe. That doesn't mean that all 100 happened this year, but over 100 large merchants as well as quite a number of channel partners, and those range from terminal providers to point-of-sale providers, to acquirers, to networks to distribute our QR codes, all of that across Venmo and PayPal. And of course, we announced today our partnership with CVS.  And those are the kinds of merchants that we want. Merchants where people shop there every day. They're highly known merchants or use cases that people can use, touch us every day. So why do I think it will be successful? First of all, as I said, it's demand versus push. And by the way, we are going to put aggressive marketing dollars behind this to make sure that consumers know they can use QR codes, promotions around it. And as John said, that's a large part of the investment that we'll do in the back half of this year.  Second, merchants love the scale and the brand that we have. In the U.S. alone, we've got, between Venmo and PayPal, call it, 150 million to 175 million people who are using our digital wallets. They can go after the Venmo demographic by implementing this QR code. Unlike some of the other touchless tap and pay options that have much less customers associated, here, you have the scale, and that is something that they are eager to tap into right away.  Third, this isn't just about touchless payment, just scanning a QR code. This is about the value proposition around that. This is about being able to use rewards, being able to have the integration of some of our Honey capabilities into that. So merchants can do proximity messaging in it, offers inside of that. You can use your wallet and do full funding of any of the funding instruments, including your rewards points in that QR code. And so that's the functionality that will roll out over the next 6 months. So this value proposition is one that I really like a lot as well that goes beyond just be safe and healthy when tapping or scanning your phone. And of course, QR codes, our platform and OS agnostic, any handset, any operating system.  And in terms of the economics, for the most part, it's a certain percentage, a little bit like what we have in online, not necessarily exactly the same percentage. But even at LEs -- larger merchants, it will be similar rates to other in-person rates that you have. So we think the economics over the medium term are quite positive. For us, some will be passed through, but most will be incremental economics. John, anything? John Rainey : Lisa, I would just add one other thing as we think about what this offering provides for our consumers but also the economic benefits of PayPal, it's not just in the direct unit economics that come through a point-of-sale transaction. Very importantly to us is what this will do to the overall level of engagement for consumers. So if you're using us in an off-line setting, you're much more likely to use us when you have the opportunity online. So there's a halo benefit that comes along with this usage that is very important to us as well. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Nice, guys. Nice results. Look, just given the substantial incremental margins, we're seeing margins overall up to over 500 basis points. What -- can you just touch on your strategy on the balance between the investments you want to make in the business versus margin expansion? Just -- it's great to see the higher base. But when we think about we're hearing from clients that you guys really should be stepping on the gas in terms of the opportunities you can have. So just love to hear more in terms of where you're going to be putting those dollars and the balance. Daniel Schulman : Yes. Thanks for that, Darrin. I'll start off and John can come in. Look, first of all, just in general, we invest where we see opportunity. That's been what we've done over the years. I think it's why we've had the results that we have. We could always have higher margins without investing in the business. But that's not what I think all of you and our shareholders want from us. There is huge opportunity in front of us. I think probably more opportunity than we've ever seen before. And we have the opportunity to invest in new areas of the business that we think can be meaningful contributors to our growth as we look forward, but even more importantly, meaningful to our customers, merchants and consumers in terms of the capabilities that they are asking for us.  And so as John said, plus or minus, just in the back half of the year, we're investing an incremental $300 million or so. And the places we're investing in is in-store. I just talked about that and why that's so important. But also, we want to invest in our digital wallet capabilities. We have an aspiration to be in every day use case and to be a central part of a customer's life in the digital economy. And so in the next several quarters, we plan to roll out quite a number of additional capabilities, not just in-store from QR, to tap-to-pay cards, but rewards capabilities. By the way, rewards are being used much more because people aren't being able to use their rewards for travel. We're seeing an uptick in people using their rewards points to check out using PayPal. Well, obviously, our -- pretty much now almost 100% complete with our Paymentus integration. The next step is bill pay into our apps, and that we intend to have probably towards the end of this year. We're going to integrate Honey shopping tools around wish lists, coupons, rewards into our PayPal apps, eventually into our Venmo apps as well, subscription management and other capabilities, other financial services that I won't really go into any detail around today. But I think you can think about change in the amount of capabilities that we offer through our digital wallets across PayPal and Venmo.  And then finally, there are a couple of international markets where we think investment makes a ton of sense, whether that be China, which we're obviously investing in through GoPay; we're seeing explosive growth in Mexico, Japan, Brazil, really, frankly, across Western Europe, it's been amazing to see what's happened there. So we will invest continually in this business. And we invest what we think is the right amount to drive results. And if we need to invest more, we will invest more. And if we don't have things to invest in, we'll return that back to shareholders. But we've given guidance that we believe enables us to do the proper amount of investment to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us because this is a moment in time for us. John Rainey : Darrin, if I can just add quickly, you referenced our margin profile in your question. And I think that's pretty important to this discussion because what we're demonstrating right now is the real scalability of our operating model. And Darrin, like I frequently focus on the incremental margins in our business. How much profit did we bring in for every incremental dollar of revenue? And in the quarter, those incremental margins were the highest they've been for us ever at 50%. But actually, I think that a better way of looking at that is more apples to apples. And that's if you exclude the losses related to the credit reserve and you exclude acquisitions, that incremental margin was actually 70%, 7-0. And what that does is result in free cash flow like you saw us generate in the quarter at over $2 billion. And so as it gets to how we spend that, we've always been balanced between M&A, organic investment and returning cash to shareholders and we've also been opportunistic. And to the point that Dan was making, this is a time that we think it's very important to invest in a lot of these initiatives because, as I said on the last call, while these trends are seemingly changing right in front of us, we don't want to just want to be on the receiving end of that. We want to help shape the outcome here. And so we want to invest into that. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Bob Napoli : Congratulations on everything on the trends. On Venmo, I wanted to follow-up on Venmo's 60 million customers now. I think the last revenue number we've gotten was a $450 million revenue run rate, I think, is in 2019. There's a lot going on, the direct deposit strategy, commercial strategy, obviously, the QR codes, integrating Honey. What -- can you give an update on the revenue run rate? And then maybe a little color on the direct deposit strategy? Or which of these strategies are going to be the biggest movers? And I think direct deposit can be a game changer, but not sure your customer in Venmo is going to be easy to crack on direct deposits. So some color on Venmo and the different strategies and revenue trends would be really helpful. John Rainey : Sure, Bob. It's good to speak with you. We don't provide an update on Venmo's revenue each quarter, and we don't have one this quarter. But I want to say that I think across the board, this was one of Venmo's best quarters ever. We saw growth on their platform reaccelerate from the dip in Q1 to where it's over 50% growth in volume. And I think what's notable about that is we all recognize that much of the Venmo usage historically has been around social experiences. And as those have, by and large, gone away for the most part, we're seeing new use cases developed with Venmo, which really demonstrates its relevance and importance to our customer base. I think, as good as anything.  And so with respect to the monetization strategy, it's not just 1 strategy. It's a multifaceted approach that includes things like direct deposit to increase usage, include things like business profiles, include things like QR code. And then, of course, we're eventually launching the Venmo credit card later this year. And we'll continue our efforts as well around the pay with Venmo in an e-commerce setting. Daniel Schulman : Yes. I just had one quick addition to that, Bob. I would not underestimate how zealous the customers of Venmo are about living their financial life on the platform. I think each of these capabilities, whether it be direct deposit, whether it be business profiles, the credit card and a number of other things that we'll be adding, you are being rapidly adopted. The new use cases, as John said, are so interesting to see as millennials, instead of going to the restaurant, are now eating at home or outside or at the table, instead of going into a gym or doing fitness classes through streaming, instead of going to concerts or other entertainment, are now doing things online. And we're seeing all of that reflected in the usage of Venmo. And so I think, as John said, this was obviously its best quarter. But I think Venmo is -- we're continuing to invest in Venmo because it's got a really bright future and is really a crown jewel of ours. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Dan and John, could you drill down into the sequential tripling of the drivers of the sequential tripling and net new accounts for Honey? And any pull-through benefits you see on the -- for the PayPal ecosystem as a whole? Daniel Schulman : Yes. Well, I think, in this economic environment, frankly, and even before this because you had so many people struggling to make ends meet at the end of the month, and that's just and made even worse by the economic ramifications from the pandemic, but Honey's capabilities are a perfect fit for consumers and merchants at this time. And increasingly, I see the possibility to establish Honey as one of the most efficient market-making platforms for both shoppers and merchants. I mean consumers get the best price on the merchandise that they want, and then they receive rewards based on that, which incents them to do additional activities, build out their demand curves. And then merchants can customize offers right into that demand curve. So they know exactly what to do to get x amount of demand off of that. And it's really interesting when you think about -- we've always known the identity of people, and we've always known that they've made purchases. What we haven't seen is intent upfront, and you really have this perfect set of data that helps both sides of our two-sided network when you put all of that together.  And it wasn't just at Honey's NNA grew 3x. By the way, their revenues were up basically triple digits or so, almost double as well. And I'd just say a couple of quick things on that. One, the integration is fully on track. There's been no delays in any of our initiatives. We will start to export through APIs, the Honey tool sets into our PayPal wallets and within QR codes. And this, to your point about part of the PayPal ecosystem, we hope to have a seamless one-click PayPal checkout experience when shopping at Honey merchants.  I'd just say, all in, I'm really pleased with the integration so far. It's right on track, and I think we've got a real powerful set of capabilities ahead of us. David Togut : Congratulations. Daniel Schulman : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one last question from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Dan, John, you guys have highlighted a lot of the strong trends and your increased confidence that those can sustain. If we look at your second half guidance and the strength you're anticipating there, how should we think about extrapolating that into the future in terms of what makes sense to think about from a growth and margin expansion and perspective going forward? And kind of what are the key things that we should be looking for in '21 and beyond? John Rainey : Sure, James. This is John. I'll take that. There's still some uncertainty out there. I think macroeconomic uncertainty as well as how the overall path of the virus plays out. And so it's still a difficult environment to forecast in. We feel comfortable enough about the things that we're seeing in our business right now, though, to provide second half guidance. But I think the broader question is like, what does this do to our medium-term guidance? And I think it's very difficult to argue that there are not structural benefits to what's happening to our business. I mean there are definite secular tailwinds that I think are going to help us really rethink what that growth trajectory is over the longer term. We're obviously not prepared to provide that today. We're just updating that or reinstating our guidance for the year. But there are definitely compounding benefits that are coming to our platform. And some of the things that we've all talked about as being trends that would eventually take place like using contactless payments in store, they're happening right now. We've talked about the death of cash for years. Maybe this is that inflection point, that seminal moment. And so we believe that PayPal, given our position, is a structural winner in that scenario. And certainly, I think it's -- it gives cause to rethink that medium-term guidance, but it's definitely premature to do that at this point in time. Daniel Schulman : If I can just add into John's comments. I think it's clear that we've tipped into a digital-first economy. Look at the number of merchants that are coming on to our platform, 1.7 million in just 1 quarter. We have conversations with merchants around the world, large and small. All of them, all of them trying to figure out how do they implement their digital strategies in an accelerated fashion.  If you look at market research that just came out from, for instance, the business roundtable that -- where 70% of consumers say they're going to shop online more frequently and expect to continue to do so because it's easy and convenient. And so I look at all the different industries. We are clearly becoming a digital-everything world. And that acceleration has happened, and it's going to continue to happen going forward. And there's sort of one market research study after another. And as John said earlier, when we look across the world, we look at countries that have opened, now 80% of retail is open, before there is maybe only 30% of retail open, we're still at very, very high levels and still high levels of daily active users compared to last year.  So my view on our medium term is there way more opportunities than there are challenges around that. We need to see another quarter or 2, but it's likely that, that goes up. I mean that's probable, and we are investing into our growth as well. And when we invest, we expect a return on that investment. And so I would say we feel good enough right now that we've reinstated 2020. We feel great about the opportunities. We're investing in them. And give us another quarter or 2, and we'll provide updated guidance on medium term as well. Okay. Well, listen, I just want to thank everybody for your time today. I just want to say again that I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And we sure look forward to being able to see all of you in person again. And so thank you for your time. Take care. Have a good rest of the evening. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal\u2019s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, you may begin. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Gabrielle. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal\u2019s earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2020. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In discussing our company\u2019s performance, we\u2019ll refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the third quarter and full year, the impact of our acquisitions and outlook for 2021. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, November 2, 2020. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle and thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. I hope that all of you are safe and well. I\u2019m pleased to say that PayPal had a very strong quarter across all of our key operating and financial metrics. Our performance is particularly noteworthy given the macroenvironment. We are battling a pandemic that shows no signs of slowing down. Economies around the world are still quite fragile and the next six to 12 months will be defined by the timing and amount of additional fiscal stimulus and progress towards a widespread and effective vaccine. And obviously, we sit here on the eve of one of the most important elections in our country\u2019s history, and I hope that all of you, who are U.S. citizens have already voted or will tomorrow. This is the landscape we face as we go into the last quarter of 2020. At the same time, PayPal is at an exciting and meaningful inflection point in our history. Our mission has never been more important. The pandemic has brought focus to the stark reality that billions of people across the world are struggling to get by. In fact, in the past nine months, over 100 million incremental adults moved into extreme poverty. The current financial system is just not working for most people. It\u2019s inefficient and expensive for the underserved. Today\u2019s environment demands new ways of thinking about our economic system, emerging technologies combined with mobile phones and financial platforms like PayPal can drive a future of inclusion and financial health. PayPal is in a strong position to help shape a future, where everyone, not just the affluent, can participate in the new digital economy. As the use of cash continues to decline, new and innovative financial technologies are rising. For example, central banks around the world are seriously exploring or even trialing forms of retail digital currencies that they issue directly and it\u2019s also clear that digital wallets are a natural compliment to all forms of digital currencies. These trends create an opportunity for us to work with central banks and regulators to shape a modern and inclusive financial system built on more efficient digital infrastructure designed for the future. The digitization of the global economy combined with the rise of digital wallets will drive our growth over the next decade. Our scale, two-sided network, trusted brand, our strong relationships with the regulators around the world, and our AI and data modeling capabilities can all be leveraged to ensure our PayPal and Venmo apps are essential parts of our customers\u2019 daily lives. We still have a lot to do to achieve that vision, but let me be clear. We are investing to create one of the most compelling and expensive digital wallets in the world. And you can see this beginning to play out in our strong Q3 results. In Q3, our total payment volume grew by a record 36% on an FX neutral basis to $247 billion in annual run rate, just shy of $1 trillion. Even more impressive is the growth of our volumes, excluding eBay, which grew 38% eclipsing any previous record. And in early October, we hit our all-time highest TPV day outperforming any previous day in our history. These record results are happening even as eBay moves their base to their managed payments platform. eBay is now just 7% of our total volumes and will likely be between 5% to 6% by the end of the year. Our transactions in the quarter were just over $4 billion growing 30% year-over-year. This is the first time we have processed over $4 billion transactions in a quarter and it\u2019s worth noting that our core PayPal daily active accounts increased 32% versus a year ago consistent with last quarter. We added 15.2 million net new actives in Q3, our second highest quarter for organic customer acquisitions after last quarters\u2019 21.3 million NNAs. We added over 1.5 million new merchants in the quarter, over two times our pre-COVID rate and we now have 28 million merchants on our platform. We ended Q3 with 361 million active accounts and we remain on track to end the year with a record 70 million NNAs. This influx of new customers and record transactions drove strong financial results. Our revenues grew by 25.4% on an FX end basis to $5.46 billion. We grew our non-GAAP EPS by 41% to a $1.07 even with incremental investments into our sales, marketing, product and engineering teams. In the quarter, our operating margin grew by 377 basis points from a year ago. I\u2019d like to detail some of our investments and how we see them shaping our future and let me start with Venmo. Venmo had a very strong Q3 with 65 million users driving $44.3 billion in TPV up 61% year-over-year. Venmo\u2019s growth continues to exceed our expectations and we are forecasting revenue for Venmo to approach $900 million in 2021 driven by investments in new capabilities. As the Venmo\u2019s revenue base diversifies and scales its transaction margin continues to improve and we now expect Venmo to also make a positive contribution to our transaction margin dollars in 2021. By Q1, the Venmo checkout experience will mirror the ease and simplicity of a PayPal branded transaction. We anticipate a meaningful increase in merchant transactions with some of the world\u2019s largest retailers and marketplaces incorporating Venmo as a payment option at checkout, both online and offline as our QR codes are integrated into physical retail. The Venmo credit card will be fully rolled out in Q1. I think it is the best credit card in the market. It is a true extension of the Venmo app and fully linked into its capabilities. It is the first to have a personalized QR code embossed on the card, as well as the contactless chip. So that transactions can be split right at the table and reflect it instantaneously on your Venmo feed. Our cash back rewards are amongst the most generous in the industry and automatically, calculate your top spend categories every month to apply the appropriate cash back percentages. I would encourage all of you to try it as soon as you can, because it is truly a best-in-class experience. Over the next year, both the Venmo and PayPal apps will undergo a fundamental transformation intended to dramatically increase their functionality and drive engagement. Our goal is to provide our customers with a comprehensive set of services and tools to manage their financial lives as well as enhance their ability to shop both online and offline. This expanded suite of services will include enhanced direct deposit and check cashing, budget and savings tools, bill pay, investment alternatives, including crypto, subscription management, buy now, pay later optionality and all of Honey\u2019s shopping tools from wish list, price monitoring, deals, coupons, and rewards. An important enabler of engagement is our comprehensive push into the physical world. Our consumers, merchants, and regulators all believe that PayPal plays a crucial role in allowing safe, digital and contactless payments. Our goal is to be the most ubiquitous payment capability in the offline market, through a combination of QR codes, contactless cards, NFC inside our mobile apps, as well as our embedded PayPal wallet experiences inside Google Pay and Samsung Pay among others. As I mentioned Honey\u2019s shopping tools, coupons and rewards will be integrated into our omni-checkout solutions assuring the best deals for our consumers, wherever they shop and we will also enable merchants of all sizes to access anonymous demand data, so that they can drive incremental sales and increased customer engagement across their multiple channels. Our move into physical retail will no doubt be a multiyear journey. But we are already seeing strong early adoption of our QR code solution. We have 10 major retailers signed, including CVS, Nike, Tumi, Bed, Bath & Beyond and Samsonite, and we are in meaningful discussions with well over 100 large retailers. We have also signed 20 channel partners and point-of-sale providers from VeriFone to Ardian, who are in the process of integrating our QR codes with an additional 70 channel partners in deep negotiations. Just the signed deals alone enable our QR capabilities at millions of merchant locations. We anticipate ending the year with over 500,000 small and micro merchants accepting our QR codes. Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss our recent announcement to increase the utility of cryptocurrencies, as well as embrace new forms of Central Bank digital currencies. We are entering a new era of financial services where our wallets and all the services around them are moving from physical to digital. These include identity management, new forms of commerce and fully digital payments and financial services. As such, we recently announced that PayPal will allow account holders to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies first, in the U.S. and then expanding to international markets in the Venmo platform in the first half of next year. Importantly, we are doing this in close partnership with regulators. As you saw, the New York Department of Financial Services granted PayPal, a first of its kind conditional bit license. With this foundation in place, we will rapidly move at the beginning of next year and allow consumers to use cryptocurrencies as a funding instrument to shop across all 28 million of our merchants. This solution will not involve any additional integrations, volatility risk or incremental transaction fees for either consumers or merchants and will fundamentally bolster the utility of cryptocurrencies. This is just the beginning of the opportunities we see as we work hand in hand with regulators to accept new forms of digital currencies. We\u2019re at a moment in our history, where all of our past efforts, our scale, brand reputation and regulatory relationships, position us to play an expensive role in our customers\u2019 lives. There\u2019s obviously plenty in the near-term macroeconomic environment that makes us cautious. As we look ahead to Q4 in 2021. At the same time, we see multiple tailwinds from the permanent shift towards a digital economy. Our revenue and EPS forecast for the years ahead are substantially higher than those we had developed just a year ago, and I\u2019ve never been more enthusiastic about PayPal\u2019s role in shaping a new future. I\u2019d like to close by thanking our employees, who continue to give so much time and energy to supporting customers while doing their best to bounce a blurring work and home life. their dedication and commitment to PayPal and our customers is inspiring. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John. John? John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I\u2019d like to start by also thanking the entire PayPal team for their efforts to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. PayPal\u2019s third quarter was one of the strongest in our history. The sustained momentum in our business allowed us to outperform. our results demonstrate the strength of our diversified platform, our global reach, the scalability of our business and our sustainable earnings power. Notably, we delivered these outstanding results against the backdrop of eBay\u2019s managed payments transition, continued weakness in the travel and events verticals, and the decline in other value-added services revenue. relative to our expectations going into the third quarter, eBay\u2019s payments intermediation proceeded faster than we had anticipated. In addition, the recovery and travel volumes were slower than our forecast, travel and events volumes, which represented slightly more than 10% of our TPV last year, were down 40% year-over-year. While this is an improvement from the decline in the second quarter, it makes our overall volume growth even more remarkable. Now, I\u2019ll discuss more details of our financial performance for the third quarter. Revenue in the third quarter increased 25% on a currency neutral basis to $5.46 billion. Transaction revenue grew 29% on a currency neutral basis, representing 11 points of acceleration from the third quarter last year. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross-border growth. notably, transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay grew 31% in the third quarter, accelerating approximately four points from Q2 and approximately seven points from Q3 last year. Other value-added services revenue declined 10% on a currency neutral basis. reduced interest income on customer balances from lower interest rates and less credit revenue contributed to this decline. Honey contributed approximately one and a half points of growth to total revenue, which only partially offset the headwinds to other value-added services revenue. In the third quarter, transaction take rate was 2.06% and total take rate was 2.21%. The 15 basis point decline in transaction take rate was driven ratably by the impact of 47% growth in P2P volumes, merchant volume mix, which includes incremental bill payment volumes and the reduction of $87 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. the 24 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from each of these factors as well as lower other value-added services\u2019 revenue. transaction expenses hit a record low rate of 82 basis points, driven by both funding mix and volume mix in the quarter. Transaction losses were 13 basis points as a rate of TPV, one basis point better than Q3 last year. We continue to improve our loss performance through the ongoing advancement of our risk mitigation strategies and enhancement of our risk models. Credit losses were one basis point as a rate of TPV, fewer originations in conjunction with a consistent macro outlook and no meaningful change in credit quality relative to the second quarter contributed to this lower rate. As you\u2019ll see in our 10-Q, our loan loss reserve coverage ratio increased from 22% to 24%, which is primarily driven by the contraction of our merchant receivables portfolio. moving to our non-transaction related expenses, consistent with our remarks when we reported second quarter results, we are increasing our organic investment spend in the back half of the year. This environment has created a unique opportunity for us to advance our leadership and payments, and extend our competitive advantages and emerged from this period stronger and better position to increase our relevance. While this incremental investment is more heavily weighted to Q4, we began deploying these funds in Q3. Non-transaction related expenses increased by 23% from Q3 last year, reflecting this increased level of investment. While sales and marketing spend was higher as a percentage of revenue, this was more than offset by leverage across each of our other non-transaction related expense line items. Overall, we realized leverage of 50 basis points on non-transaction related expenses. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.2%. This is the strongest performance we\u2019ve reported for any third quarter and represents a 377 basis point improvement from last year. We continue to be focused on delivering operating efficiencies while investing in our strategic priorities. Non-GAAP other income declined by $57 million relative to last year, driven by increased interest expense from a higher debt balance and reduced interest on corporate cash from lower interest rates. From a modeling standpoint, we expect this line item to continue to be a net expense in the near-term. For the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 41% to $1.07. The timing of our incremental investment spend, which is weighted more towards the fourth quarter contributed to the strong performance. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.6 billion. In addition, we generated $479 million in free cash flow. lower free cash flow in the quarter resulted primarily from higher cash taxes. The core cash generation of the business remains extremely strong. On average, in 2020, we\u2019ve generated approximately $1.3 billion in free cash flow each quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow. And now, I want to shift to our expectations for the rest of 2020 and 2021. In reinstating guidance in July, we were providing our best estimate of performance for the back half of the year. The degree of difficulty inherent in providing an outlook was and continues to be significant. We are an important part of the foundation of global commerce and do not operate in isolation. COVID rates, quarantine measures, stimulus programs, election outcomes, and the normalization of economic activity all affect our estimates. What we do know is that our business is very strong. Our core business continues to perform at an unprecedented level. We\u2019ve seen a step change in e-commerce penetration this year. We expect there to be a deep and permanent change to commerce and consumer behavior, both in the U.S. and internationally. while it\u2019s difficult to quantify the precise degree to which secular trends will be affected by the pandemic. Our addressable opportunity has grown meaningfully. Our fourth quarter forecast contemplates, sustained strength in our business, reflecting the powerful value proposition of our two-sided platform and the profound shift in consumer behavior we\u2019ve seen this year towards e-commerce and increased digitization. relative to a few months ago, we expect a greater impact on fourth quarter revenue growth from eBay\u2019s payments intermediation, given the pace of merchant migration in the third quarter. Heading into Q3, we anticipated this to be about a two point headwind to fourth quarter revenue growth. We now expect it to be about three and a half points. over the longer-term, a more rapid transition emergence to eBay\u2019s managed payments platform is better for us strategically, financially and operationally. It will allow us to contain this impact mostly to the back half of this year and next year, relative to a slower progression of merchants with a much longer tail. All of this is to say, and this is a very important point that while headwinds to our revenue growth and transaction margin expansion will appear more pronounced over the next year from eBay. This impact will be largely contained to that period. Even more importantly, once we are beyond this transition, we expect our volume and revenue growth rates to reaccelerate given the drag that eBay has been for the past five years. during this period, on average, PayPal\u2019s revenue, excluding eBay has grown about 23% annually by comparison revenue from eBay\u2019s marketplaces business, even including this year stronger growth profile has grown on average only about 4% each year. on a volume basis, the divergence between these growth rates is even more stark. In addition, we expect the slower recovery and travel to persist while we sell travel volumes strengthen in June and July, we\u2019ve not seen these levels sustain. We believe this is likely due in part to continued high coronavirus infection rates and the impact of the virus on global mobility. Similar to eBay, the headwinds from travel volumes are transitory and exogenous. As a result of these dynamics, we expect our fourth quarter revenue growth to be in the range of 20% to 25% on both the spot and currency neutral basis. for the full year, this will result in a range for revenue growth of 21% to 22% on a currency neutral basis or 20% to 21% on a spot basis. This guidance is approximately three points higher than our expectations at the start of the year. To put it in perspective, we expect to add more than $3.5 billion to our revenue base this year, which is more than one and a half times the revenue we added in 2019. On our call last quarter, we stated that we expected to deliver 25% EPS growth for the back half of the year. We are raising that outlook to 29%; incorporated into this outlook is 17% to 18% growth in EPS in the fourth quarter, which reflects the increased weighting of investment spend relative to the third. for the year, we now expect this will result in approximately 27% to 28% growth in non-GAAP EPS; marking the fourth consecutive year, in which we delivered at least 25% growth in EPS. Again, to put this in context relative to last year on an essentially flat share count, we\u2019ll be adding more than $0.80 in earnings for each share outstanding and relative to our medium-term outlook, which calls for approximately 20% EPS growth each year. We are now more than $0.30 per share ahead of this plan. I\u2019d now like to discuss how we\u2019re thinking about our outlook beyond 2020. The strong acceleration we\u2019ve experienced this year, along with the pronounced shift in consumer behavior, sets us up exceptionally well for the years ahead. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever been more excited or energized about our prospects. We are clearly on a trajectory to deliver stronger long-term growth than our previously guided medium-term outlook of 17% to 18% currency neutral revenue growth, and approximately 20% earnings growth on average annually. That said, 2021 still presents a hurdle. Given the transition off of eBay, next year was always going to be a tougher comp for us. Our very strong performance this year adds to this dynamic. In providing guidance this year, our goal has been to responsibly balance transparency with reliability and certainty. looking at the range of outcomes for the entirety of 2021 requires us to look out over the next 14 months. We are very confident in our opportunity set, positioning and ability to drive increased engagement. However, there continues to be significant variability in macro-related factors, and we feel that providing guidance for that period right now would require a wider guidance range than we believe is constructive. Once we close out 2020, we\u2019ll be better positioned to provide our thoughts for 2021, which we will share in February when we report our full-year results. In addition, at our Investor Day later that month, we look forward to providing more context for our longer-term outlook. Our ability to sustainably deliver strong growth at our scale is indicative of the network effects of our business. Our performance demonstrates our ability to successfully execute in the face of a more challenging operating environment, as well as the strength, diversity and resilience of our platform. This is really a year unlike any other. in many ways, our collective experience has demonstrated that we\u2019ve never been more connected or more dependent on one another to help each other drive prosperity and development and realize the promise of globalization. PayPal stands at the center of this. In 2020, we will process more than $900 billion in payment volume and serve approximately 375 million customers. We are the largest open digital platform for payments globally; in the events of this year, have served to strengthen our value proposition and relevance. We have an important role to play in facilitating commerce and payments, and we\u2019re executing our plans with an urgency to meet the growing needs of our customers in this increasingly digital world. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : All right. Thanks, guys. I know you\u2019re all holding off at this point on guidance, given the macro variability. but coming off a year with 70 million net new actives, which at least 30 million more than you would have expected, a lot of these are new demographics rather than a pull forward, as you guys are talking about. Can you just talk, maybe, touch on the types of NNAs you\u2019d expect for either 2021 or even longer-term, kind of additions you can add and really thinking about that in context of 32% growth in daily active users. what are we talking about in terms of opportunity there and really what are the drivers of it? Is it international? All the partnerships? It seems like there could be a long runway, but a lot of people, I think just want to hear where \u2013 what the sources are? Thanks, guys. Dan Schulman : Yes. Hey Darrin, it\u2019s Dan. Thanks for your question. So, we had another strong quarter for NNAs, our second highest organic quarter for net new actives. by the way, interestingly, the shape of that is very consistent, approximately 5 million net new actives each month coming in, no fall off, no pull forward, just consistent growth in that metric. And as you know, we\u2019re still targeting and feel comfortable with a 70 million number that we gave last quarter for NNAs for the year. I think a couple of important things to point out here. first of all, the number of new merchants that are coming on the platform remains quite elevated over 1.5 million merchant accounts. This quarter, our run rate pre-COVID was somewhere around 500,000 to 750,000. So now, we\u2019ve got 28 million merchants on the platform and 361 total active accounts. in many ways here, scale begets scale. As we grow as more and more merchants, have PayPal, you probably have noticed as well, more and more merchants are putting PayPal front and center. We\u2019re creating new and more compelling ways to buy our Buy Now Pay Later has exploded into the marketplace. We\u2019ve just rolled that out to the vast majority of our consumer base. We\u2019re seeing huge take-up in that and incremental halo as a result of it. And so my view on net new actives is we\u2019re going to continue to see good growth on that for a couple of reasons, one, our checkout experience and the number of products that we\u2019re putting out there is just increasing. You heard me say in my remarks; we are very focused on expanding our digital wallet capabilities, both on Venmo and to PayPal. We are very serious about driving towards being in everyday use case. Why is it so important when somebody uses two or more of our products, say checkout and P2P, their churn reduces by 50% and think about as we approach 400 million customers on our platform, every basis point of churn reduction matters a ton in terms of our NNAs going forward. And so I think, you\u2019ve got a continued drive, every industry towards digitization, more and more merchants coming on, more products, more functionality, and reduce churn. And I think, as we looked forward, I think NNAs will continue to remain elevated, versus pre-COVID levels. Darrin Peller : All right. Thanks a lot, Dan. Dan Schulman : Yes. You bet. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. here, I wanted to ask on the \u2013 on some of the KPIs, I think they\u2019re related, if you don\u2019t mind me just putting them all together. So, TPV accelerated while transaction revenue growth held pretty constant. And I know you talked about the take rate here, John, but can you maybe, unpack it for us a little bit more and help us on how it might trend in the fourth quarter, and maybe, even in 2021 with eBay and Paymentus and PayPal and everything else, and then separately, but somewhat related, just looking at the fourth quarter guide. I know you're assuming some deceleration from the third quarter. I heard that eBay being a point and a half incrementally weaker here, any other call-outs beyond conservatism. I totally get why you\u2019re not giving 2021, but I know a lot of moving pieces going into the end of the year here. Thank you. John Rainey : Sure, Tien-Tsin, it\u2019s good to speak with you. So, we did see a strong acceleration in TPV in the quarter. and aside from just growth overall in the business, there\u2019s a couple things to call out. I think notably P2P volume was up almost 50%, 47%, I believe is the exact number. And then we saw a lot more volume from bill pay with the 100% ramp of Paymentus and the quarter and so good strong growth there. As it relates to revenue, we had a $17 million hedge loss in the quarter and that relates to a $70 million hedge gain in the prior year. So, you\u2019ve got the difference there that really put pressure on the revenue side relative to TPV. on take rate, there\u2019s a couple of dynamics to think about too. You\u2019ve got \u2013 while P2P and bill pay tend to have lower take rates, they also have lower transaction expenses. And so what we consistently focus on in our business is not necessarily take rate, but the incremental transaction margin dollars and a way to think about our business in the quarter, Tien-Tsin, like for every dollar of revenue of incremental growth that we brought in, in the quarter, almost $0.70 of that fell to the transaction margin line. And so it shows that there\u2019s a good balance between those items that maybe have a lower take rate, but also have a lower transaction expense. So, we\u2019re very focused on the margin profile of those different elements of our business with respect to the fourth quarter. the only thing I\u2019d call out in addition to eBay, which we talked about in our prepared remarks, the travel and event vertical, as I also mentioned, has been slower to recover, to recover than we anticipated. Again, we saw some green shoots back in June and July and those haven\u2019t persisted to the extent that we mentioned. but again, I\u2019ll point out both of those things are transitory and they really in terms of the long-term impact to our business, it\u2019s not going to matter for us. We\u2019re very excited about not only what next year holds, but each year thereafter, the math of each of those is that, yes, it\u2019s a tougher comp for next year. But when we laughed out, we\u2019ll be at a place, where we actually have accelerated growth from that time period. Dan Schulman : Yes. And I\u2019d just add to that giving a wider range in Q4 just makes sense to go do it\u2019s the prudent thing to do. It in no way, takes away from the underlying strengths in our business. I mean, our core remains extremely strong, core PayPal growing at 30% plus in revenue, October was a good month for us. But you\u2019ve got everything from the virus numbers, lockdowns, which probably have the benefit of helping us as more people are at home spending online. But we balance out with what is consumer confidence kind of look like, what\u2019s the economy due to stimulus payments, what\u2019s the holiday shopping season going to look like? We\u2019ve got an election coming up tomorrow, potential social unrest. When we put all of that together, it just is prudent to give a wider range. And so that wider range to us does nothing to take away from the strength we see in the business, but we felt it was the right thing to do. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. Makes sense. Thank you, all. Dan Schulman : Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg, please go ahead \u2013 sorry of Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, just wondering as we think about the puts and takes for 2021, I mean, is it fair to assume that the eBay headwind of 3.5% in Q4 20 is a decent proxy for next year, and then how we should think about some of the other puts and takes, whether it be the ongoing travel headwind, or obviously, you\u2019ve got a whole host of new initiatives like paying for an in-store, et cetera. So that\u2019s the first part of my question. And then just on the second part regarding this notion of acceleration in the core business, due to COVID, any way to give us a rough idea of that, I mean, if you just take eBay out of the equation, how much do you think your revenue growth profile has structurally accelerated with a multiyear view again, excluding eBay? Dan Schulman : Thanks for the question, Jason. I appreciate trying to kind of parse out what 2021 would look like. Let me just say this. There are a number of puts and takes for our business next year. On the sort of headwind side obviously, eBay will continue to be a headwind next year, as they ramp through the year. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent though with our expectations around the pace of that, and we have long thought that they would be largely complete by the end of next year. And at the same time, we are still maintaining a share of checkout, which is north of 50%. And so this has been very consistent with our expectations from the onset. travel and event is going to be largely tied to the path of the virus. It\u2019s an overused term, I know, but that\u2019s largely outside of our control and when the world regains mobility, I\u2019m sure we will see a resurgence in that, but the other area that I think people perhaps haven\u2019t quite taken into account yet is the ongoing headwind that credit should be next year. And so those would be on the headwind category in terms of things that we\u2019re excited about that can help you get that or completely offset that there\u2019s a number of things that that we\u2019re doing that we\u2019ve called out. But the continued monetization of Venmo, the launch of paying for is something that we\u2019re very excited about and then expanding the consumer wallet with things like bill pay and subscriptions and so forth. So, it puts us in a pretty good position as we look at the new products that we\u2019re rolling out, which I\u2019ll say is like our product and technology team has never rolled out more products at the rate that they are at any time in my five years here. So, we\u2019re exceedingly pleased about the progress there. John Rainey : Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019d expect our core business to remain strong, maybe even get stronger throughout 2021, as we add more and more capabilities. we\u2019re seeing really nice adoption, very early obviously, in what we\u2019re doing in the offline space the crypto announcement and just the very early reactions to that are well beyond our expectations are Buy Now Pay Later value proposition is a great one. I mean, for merchants, it\u2019s no incremental costs just increases sales to them. It is and we get to leverage, the large base that we have right now and as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a host of new services, coming on board, next year. And as Darren talked about, we have 70 million, net to actives that will ride on increased transactions with each of them, counterbalanced by what we always knew was eBay, which is, as John mentioned, a transitory event, it will play itself out next year and we\u2019ll accelerate out from that. So, I think the really important thing to emphasize here is that, when we come into our Investor Day, in February, we will be raising our medium term guidance. We feel quite confident about that. Given everything that we\u2019ve seen 2021 was always going to be a year that we would transition away from eBay, frankly, I\u2019m happy that that\u2019s going as well as it is right now. And as fast as it is, so that as John mentioned, we take that part of our business that is the slowest growing part of our business. And when we replace it, it\u2019s a faster growing parts of our core business and other marketplaces. And so for us, this really couldn\u2019t come at a better time, the transition from eBay and all the things that we\u2019re doing to build our business and shape the future, gives us a lot of confidence as we look out at over the next several years. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you. John Rainey : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to just build on some of the questions particularly around next quarter and that cadence, it looks like, it sounds like John, from what you\u2019re saying is that there\u2019s going to be going to be some incremental spend in the fourth quarter, maybe, they got started late in the third quarter and that is going to impact margins. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the contributors to the very strong margins in the third quarter, a little more color on how to think about the spending and impact on the fourth quarter and then how we should think about what that margin trajectory looks like beyond that, and particularly as we head towards a normalized world. John Rainey : Sure. Well, first James you\u2019re exactly right. The balance of spend of that $300 million that we earmarked on the last call is going to happen in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s \u2013 that really gives you the different margin profile from the third to the fourth, but looking out on a more sustainable level or run rate basis whether it\u2019s 2021 or beyond, there\u2019s a data point in the \u2013 in our third quarter results, which I think really illustrates the potential that we have and that\u2019s the incremental operating margin that we had in the quarter. And so what I mean by that is for every dollar of growth that we had in revenue, how much of that fell to the bottom line and if you normalize for acquisitions, it was roughly $0.50 \u2013 $0.48 fell to the bottom line. And that demonstrates two things, which I think are relevant and hopefully answer your question. But one is just the trends that we\u2019re seeing around our core check-out and we have an expectation that those persist at a higher level than we entered this pandemic period. And so certainly, that has implications on our business, but the second and equally as important is what it says about the scalability of our business. We, in the past, have not always done the best job of growing at a low marginal cost. And for the past two or three years now, we\u2019ve demonstrated very well our ability to do that. And ours is a platform that performs very well in growth environment, because we can do it at a very low marginal cost. And so that\u2019s what you see in that operating margin performance. So, I would say that there\u2019s a natural tendency as we grow that margins are going to want to increase. that said, we also recognize that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us with the change that\u2019s happening, and we clearly want to invest into that, but it\u2019s the right thing to do in the fourth quarter and it will be the right thing to do going forward. I think fortunately, given the financial profile of our business, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that we can both do that and expand our margins and we anticipate doing so going forward. James Faucette : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thanks so much. Could you dimension the impact on PayPal\u2019s ecosystem from introducing cryptocurrencies, both to buy, sell, and hold and to use as a funding mechanism in the PayPal wallet, and if it\u2019s used as a funding source, can you help us think through the impact on transaction expense, would that be similar, let\u2019s say to ACH or debit funding? Dan Schulman : Yes. Hey, David, I\u2019ll take that question. So, I\u2019ll just take a step back clearly, the world is rapidly moving from physical to digital on that, so true for payments and financial services. My conversations with central banks, with the regulators, with a number of folks in the crypto field, there\u2019s no question that digital currencies are going to be rising an importance, having increasing functionality and increasing prominence CBDCs, from my perspective and all my conversations, are a matter of when and how they\u2019re done, not AF. And I think that our platform with its digital wallets and the scale that we have right now, can help shape the utility of those currencies that can range from interoperability, between wallets, between the currencies themselves, and importantly, into our network of merchants for commerce. And I do think that our platform and all the new digital infrastructure that we\u2019re putting in place right now can help make that management and movement of money more efficient, and less expensive and faster. Just in terms of what we\u2019ve introduced with BioXcel, we did a lot of research on that. Our base is very eager for us to offer these capabilities. It really came up very high on their wish list and we are seeing that come in to fruition very quickly. Now, we\u2019ve only rolled this out to 10% of our base. We did that a couple of days ago, but our waiting list was two to three times of what our expectations were. We\u2019re going to take up our $10,000 limit per day to $15,000 per day, based on the demand that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ll roll out to 100% in the U.S. in the next two weeks to three weeks. They\u2019re going to expand internationally and we\u2019ll expand into Venmo on the first half of next year. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re starting off with and we\u2019re seeing people who have already bought crypto open their wallet several times a day to check on what\u2019s happening with their crypto investments. We\u2019re beginning to already see some halo effects that go on with that. But what I\u2019m really excited about is what we\u2019re going to introduce next year, which is, I think going to dramatically increase the utility of cryptocurrencies by enabling somebody, who holds a cryptocurrency in a PayPal account to instantaneously transfer that crypto into fiat currency at a set rate. So, volatility is taken out of the equation. No incremental fees charged for them to do that transaction from crypto into a fiat and then immediately settle in fiat with all 28 million of our merchants at our current take rates. And so you have no additional integration needed at any of our merchants and this is just an elegant way of using cryptocurrencies as a funding mechanism, and yes, it is a lower cost funding mechanism for us in terms of those transactions. But that\u2019s just the start of things that we want to go and do with crypto capabilities over the course of next year you\u2019ll see us move into a couple of different areas. Those are the only two we\u2019re talking about right now, but I see a lot of interesting things we can do with cryptocurrencies, with functionality, increasing functionality, and again, working hand in hand with regulators every step of the way, which is so important and what they expect from us in order to be a market leader in the digital currency space. David Togut : Thanks so much. Dan Schulman : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heath Terry : Great. Dan, you\u2019ve done a lot over the last year in terms of product development between crypto and pay later. So, I realize it\u2019s a bit of a greedy ask, but when you look at the size of the point-of-sale opportunity and the success that some start-ups are having and taking share against the incumbents, I\u2019m curious where your in-person payment strategy stands at this point and how much of a priority it is for you? Dan Schulman : Yes. So, I think the best way of thinking about this, Heath, is that every five years to seven years, there\u2019s a replacement cycle for point-of-sale and we are really entering a period of change right now, where the operating models for POS have kind of literally changed overnight. Payments clearly need to now reside in the cloud, not at the physical or retail location. They need to be fully omni; they need to reside on a full platform experience across channels. And I would say that being an incumbent, this space does not add any advantage. In fact, they will need to change fundamentally the way that they think about point-of-sale. And clearly, the tailwinds are moving towards mobile-oriented point-of-sale and we want to capture what is a huge in-store opportunity, be one of the first movers to move to an online, full omni solution, and then set that up to take advantage of our two-sided network. And we have a number of plans underway with our eyes that will and PayPal here teams really to try and become a market leader over the longer term that could be five years to seven years, but you\u2019ll start to see us make moves in that. I think that really compliments all the things we\u2019re doing, as we move in-store with our consumer base, our QR codes, our contactless payments, and if see inside our app, as well as embedding ourselves and other star pays. But we\u2019re beginning to see, as I mentioned, a lot of early traction in our move in the offline space, and I think there\u2019s a really huge opportunity and we are \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, we are being pulled into that space by retailers and by consumers, and the faster we move, the more opportunity I think we can gain there. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks, Dan. Really appreciate it. Dan Schulman : Yes. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian King : Hi, guys. Just want to ask about the new products in particular, the BNPL, just trying to get a sense of how much incremental volume opportunity is there versus replacing other PayPal payment options. Just thinking about are you going to be able to gain share or checkout at the merchant site? And then secondly, on the Venmo monetization, I heard the $900 million revenue number, any sense of how that breaks out next year with growth rates for Venmo credit card, is that a big percentage of that versus pay with Venmo, et cetera? Thanks so much. Dan Schulman : Yes. So, starting out with Buy Now Pay Later and then quickly go into to Venmo. I\u2019m extraordinarily pleased with the success that we\u2019re having with Buy Now Pay Later. We rolled this out in France several months before we introduced this into the U.S. and then into the UK and the uptick that we are seeing in the French market is well beyond any of our expectations. And we just rolled out in the U.S. and the demand is tremendous. And you probably, if you\u2019ve opened up your PayPal app very recently in the last couple of days to pay for something on a merchant location, you\u2019re probably seeing, paying for a pop-up as a option. I think our value proposition there is second to none and the reason I say that is it is a beautiful experience in terms of the ability to simply easily from a consumer to take a larger purchase and divided in four payments, interest free. We know our consumers; we have a very high acceptance rate as a result of that. And for merchants, unlike any of the competitors that are offering Buy Now Pay Later functionality. We are offering this as part of our service. There are no incremental fees except for the basic transaction fees that we charge merchants today. And so what we are seeing is just use of it, that\u2019s well beyond our expectations, I think is going to be one of our big growth drivers as we go into next year and into 2022. I\u2019m quite high on the potential of what we \u2013 what we\u2019ll see with Buy Now Pay Later. And by the way, there\u2019s a ton more we can do on that too and we\u2019ve got a large roadmap around that on that. On Venmo, look, we\u2019ve put out a couple of things, here that are new. we do expect Venmo to approach about $900 million in revenues next year. by the way, we expect Venmo to reach profitability in 2022 and that\u2019s another big thing to think about. Venmo is clearly turning the corner, right now, these are just like these incremental steps that people have been waiting for. But we are seeing that come to play and Venmo has a host of new things coming out, they\u2019ve got the Venmo credit card, which is one. And by the way, I said, it\u2019s best in the market like I\u2019ve been using the Venmo credit card for the last month or so, it is an incredible experience. I really cannot wait for all of you to use it and see just what I mean. Second, we are really revamping the whole pay with Venmo experience, it\u2019s been a little clunky \u2013 more clunky than I would have liked, but by first quarter, that will be as seamless as a PayPal transaction and we have a ton of extremely large merchants and marketplaces that are anxious to integrate Venmo as a payment mark. And then we obviously have business profiles, crypto capabilities, more basic financial tools shopping tools coming into that, all of those will add to the Venmo revenue. There isn\u2019t one thing that\u2019s dominant in that they\u2019re all adding to that. And so really pleased with the Venmo\u2019s growth and trajectory, and you have to see an acceleration in its TPV growth, now two quarters in a row at the scale that it has. It\u2019s pretty impressive. Brian King : Great. Thanks so much. Dan Schulman : Yes. You bet. Operator : And we have time for one last question from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. And Dan, so you\u2019ve highlighted a number of times on the call that transformation underway with the PayPal and Venmo consumer apps to add all these new use cases like bill payments, paying for crypto, Honey, et cetera. Can you just talk a bit more about how we should think about the operational and financial rollout of this transformation, meaning what\u2019s sort of the roadmap or timing of when new functionality would be rolled out? How are you going to be driving adoption? How should we think about monetization et cetera just as we look out over the next 12 months to 18 months? Dan Schulman : Yes. Hi, Lisa. good to hear your voice. happy to do so. This is probably one of our, not probably \u2013 this is one of our top focus areas; this is building out a comprehensive and compelling digital wallet for our consumers. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question as we move into the digital economy that \u2013 apps that provide a comprehensive suite of interlinked functionality around financial services, payments, shopping identity management will be an essential part of our customers\u2019 lives. I mean a daily part of their lives. Now with the wallet, the capabilities that we\u2019re talking about are both online and in-store. So, that\u2019s sort of, online, offline shopping capabilities, rewards management, being able to use rewards points, translate those, the fiat to pay, at any one of our merchants and also incorporate that in-store as well. All sorts of financial services you mentioned a couple of them bill pay increasing focus on direct deposit, check cashing, savings, goals, investments, PFM and then integrating all of our Honey shopping tools, crypto capabilities Buy Now Pay Later. And by the way, Lisa importantly, not just putting all that functionality out into our digital wallet, but creating a UX, a user experience that enables somebody to simply and easily move from one experience to another and have each of those experiences build on each other. And so we will start to roll out bill pay, this month we will \u2013 towards the end of the month, we\u2019ll start to roll that out. I think you can expect kind of at end of the first half of this year for us to have a pretty large UX completion design in our customers\u2019 hands with a lot of functionality coming out in my view in the second quarter and the back half of the year. But I expect that the predominance of what I\u2019ve just talked about in place by the end of next year. And as John said, we\u2019re investing behind this. I\u2019m really pleased, as John mentioned with the delivery \u2013 on-time delivery and the excellence of the applications that are coming out into our market. And so expect to see a step functionality in the back half of Q2 of this year and then to build on that as we go into the rest of the year. Lisa Ellis : Very exciting. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yes, it is exciting. Okay. I want to thank everybody for all of your great questions this would really \u2013 I\u2019m glad we had a chance to talk about all those things and look forward to talking to each of you more in the weeks and months ahead. So, thank you very much. Everybody, have a good day and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Bye-Bye.",

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital era, erasing the distinction between online and offline. A digital-first world is no longer our future. It\u2019s our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives. At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers in lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by three to five years, unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. And we now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis. Our TPV excluding eBay was up a record 40% as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% to $5 billion. Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo\u2019s customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. Today\u2019s digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement. In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold crypto currencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options. We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey\u2019s shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. I\u2019m very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, Five Below, Levi\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Macy\u2019s and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20 billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch. Even with high initial expectations the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system as consumers no longer want to handle cash. We all know, the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. I would also highlight the rapid growth of our Buy Now Pay Later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter, and witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate. It\u2019s exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. I\u2019m proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. We have entered the next chapter in PayPal\u2019s history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past five years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step up that pace in 2021. Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities over the next five years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world\u2019s leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day, next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacement and e-commerce adoption. These secular trends have been shaping our sector for some time. That said, the rate of change we experienced last year, resulting from the widespread implications of the COVID pandemic, was profound and transformative. Crisis, which has led to hardship and suffering for so many, increased the urgency across our organization to serve our customers in new and innovative ways. Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. We\u2019ve entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. Now, to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. Our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross-border activity. Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue. In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis-point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay\u2019s contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis-point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both, volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2 times the incremental contribution last year. Non-transaction-related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations, and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities. Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. I\u2019d now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We\u2019ve just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay, post operating agreement. These headwinds persist as we move into 2021. And yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we\u2019ve commented on several occasions over the past nine months, we\u2019re focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It\u2019s with these considerations that we\u2019re providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high-20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19%, based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay\u2019s managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis-point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we\u2019re pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical. Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I\u2019d like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more durability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year\u2019s cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll-off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we\u2019ll report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. As we move through the year, we\u2019ll keep you updated on how we\u2019re tracking relative to this expected cadence. Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. In summary, last year was a year like no other. But, in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business, PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our Company is moving forward. The next five years will be very different than the last five, and we\u2019re striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can\u2019t make it to a physical store or don\u2019t want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It\u2019s a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security, and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask about the new growth initiatives, and two-part question here, maybe one for John and one for Dan. First part is, does your guidance assume that the aggregate revenue contribution of these new growth initiatives will be enough to offset the 4% eBay headwind in 2021? And then, the second part is, among the various new growth initiatives, which have surprised you the most to the upside so far, and which did you perhaps think would be seeing a little bit more adoption to date than they have been to date? John Rainey : Hey Jason, I\u2019ll start with the first part of your question and turn it to Dan, if that\u2019s okay. With respect to offsetting the headwind from eBay, the fact that we\u2019re expanding, or better said, that our projected guidance suggests that we\u2019re expanding our operating margins, would certainly indicate that we think between the momentum in the business and the additional initiatives combined that we can offset the pressure related to eBay. Certainly, the initiatives -- all initiatives take a while to ramp up. The bulk of our new initiatives are really, we would expect the financial impact to be in the second half of the year. But, when you combine that with the momentum in the business, it certainly allows us to offset that headwind. Dan Schulman : Jason, I\u2019ll try and answer your second question there. So, that\u2019s like asking me to choose, which of these are my favorite kids. And none of the product managers that are hanging [indiscernible] answer. So, look, we put out a couple of big initiatives into the markets. Our in-store to our crypto, to our Buy Now Pay Later, and honestly, all of them surpass our internal projections and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. Crypto, yes, started off with a bang and just kept going and is continuing to go. But, in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about Buy Now Pay Later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. Since I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean, we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced, and we had almost 3 million customers using Buy Now Pay Later, hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that\u2019s not the total number of transactions. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so, it\u2019s not just that you had customers in it. I mean, they\u2019re just voting with their feed and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there. First of all, we\u2019ve got 350 million customers that we can bring their trust to PayPal. We know them. And so, our approval rates are higher we think than anybody else out there, when people sign up for Buy Now Pay Later. Second, it is no incremental cost to the merchant. I mean, all of the other competitors charge a pretty significant incremental cost. And for us we\u2019re just charging the same take rate that the merchant had. It\u2019s very, very light integration, which is why we saw well over 10,000 merchants integrate Buy Now Pay Later up the funnel really on the product pages and not at checkout. We\u2019re beginning to see more and more of that as we come into the year. Another thing that is really interesting to me -- oh, here, the halo effect, by the way, very early days, it\u2019s the halo effect. It\u2019s about 15% increase in TPV. And we think all of that TPV so far is incremental TPV for us. But the other thing is we\u2019re seeing a meaningful double-digit reduction in the cost of those transactions as well. And so, when you look at kind of the scale and you look at the value proposition the take up of merchants, and that\u2019s continued on into the first quarter, this is clearly a home run for us and a winner. And it is not to dismiss any of my other favorite kids because they all had great years, but Buy Now Pay Later was probably the biggest surprise. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Well, thanks for all the commentary. Dan Schulman : Yes, you bet. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : I really enjoyed the presentation here. I wanted to ask on M&A, if that\u2019s okay. I just wanted to check your appetite on acquisitions, and especially at this point of cycle, given that so many of these digital assets have been inflated in terms of valuation during the pandemic here. And any change in your thinking around M&A? I saw on the slide you had some great detail on your strategic investments, but how about M&A? John Rainey : Tien-Tsin, I\u2019ll start and maybe Dan will jump in. But, I think, there\u2019s two really important points to consider when we think about acquisitions for PayPal. The first is that we are somewhat unique in the FinTech ecosystem, and so far, as we enjoy outsized growth rates, but we also are extremely profitable. And that results in the type of free cash flow generation with 20% plus free cash flow margins. And that uniqueness that allows us the ability to have this effectively an asset where we can go out and look at inorganic opportunities to complement what we\u2019re doing organically. So, I think that\u2019s one important point to think about. The second, and it really gets to your point around where some valuations are. But, we exercise a tremendous amount of discipline in the way that we look at this. And from an overall capital allocation perspective, our view is, every dollar of capital has to compete with the other alternatives out there, whether that be organic or that be returning cash to shareholders or going out and acquiring a company. And so, we will remain disciplined and really view our acquisitive strategy over a multi-year longer term timeframe. Dan Schulman : Yes. I\u2019d just add to that, Tien-Tsin. If you think about our need for acquisition, that -- what is our pace of organic innovation? And in 2020, we put out more product and services than we\u2019ve ever put out before. I said, in my remarks that we\u2019re going to step up that pace in 2021, and we\u2019re going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we\u2019ve made over the past five plus years in our tech infrastructure and our compliance and risk management, what that\u2019s enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. We put out last year, between config release and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time where we\u2019re all working from home. So, our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved, using modern programming language, you have a service oriented architecture. And by the way, all that\u2019s happening while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. And so, I\u2019m really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products. And that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition. I would just build on John\u2019s point. We obviously had a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we\u2019re going to look at that and as John said, in a very disciplined manner, we\u2019re going to look at talent, types of acquisitions, where can we do maybe a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We\u2019ll look at geographic types of acquisitions where we may want to go after geography and there may be a player or two there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we\u2019ll look at that carefully. And if there\u2019s a real capability that not that we can\u2019t develop and do, but it\u2019s going to take us too long to get there. Because what we\u2019re trying to do on our roadmap, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So, I think we\u2019ve got a good one-two punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. It\u2019s very clear. It\u2019s going to be fun to track the organic products for sure. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dan Schulman : James, are you there? I won\u2019t be the first one to say this, but are you off mute? Why don\u2019t we go to the next question and we can put James back in the queue little bit later, Gabriel? Operator : All right. So, your next question will come from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : All right. Hey guys. Thanks. Congrats on the year also. With your expectation for adding 50 million net new actives in \u201821, which was clearly an impressive number when looking at the 72 million you guys just added, and then the pre-pandemic normalized level\u2019s around 35 million, I think per year, right? Does that -- I guess, first, does that underscore the incremental adds -- you\u2019re confident that the incremental adds in 2020 were really not pulled forward, but they\u2019re just new demographics. And so, looking off of last year, if you could walk us through the different drivers, whether it\u2019s geography or product, giving you the competence and adding 50 million net new actives in \u201821 versus, the pre-pandemic 35 million or so levels would be great? Dan Schulman : Yes. Darrin, I think, when we look at the cohorts of net new actives from last year, which clearly incremental people coming on, over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we\u2019ve had. So, you\u2019re really seeing new demographics come on to the platform. But, what\u2019s really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double digit increases in a value per net new active, our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, because this kind of gets a little bit lost because we\u2019re including Honey net new actives in the denominator, and we also -- as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new actives last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on a typical year, because when you put somebody on to the platform, they don\u2019t have all the transactions. They all didn\u2019t come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so, that puts pressure on it. But, our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis was grown 11.5%. That\u2019s above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1 times a year. And so, our churn rates in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new adds coming in. There is plenty of demand to come onto our platform. But, when we see churn reduction, like we\u2019re seeing right now, because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming I guess again people who are just moving online, and because of these new products that are out right now, that people are just using a ton more, like crypto is a great example. Everyone has signed on for crypto. So, it is opening up their wallet at 2 times the level of what they did previous. And so, I think, that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We\u2019ll obviously update, as we go on. But, we\u2019re seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we\u2019re bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number. Darrin Peller : That makes sense. Really helpful, Dan. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good afternoon, Dan and John. Could you discuss the drivers of operating leverage, both at the transaction expense and the other OpEx level? And in particular, are you seeing the sustained volume mix shift toward the branded PayPal wallet versus Braintree and P2P benefiting transaction margin, as well as the continued funding mix shift toward debit? John Rainey : Sure, David. You packed in a lot in that question. So, let me just -- I\u2019ll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that\u2019s consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, although not at the levels that we saw in 2Q, and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. Braintree continues to perform very well for us. But, it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, five-zero percent for us. And so, that\u2019s a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that that\u2019s in excess of 10% of our volume. But, when you look at the areas of leverage for our business, so I think we will continue to see strong core PayPal trends, PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business. But, we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. So, we\u2019re performing very well there. But, if you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume related expenses, we\u2019ve invested a lot obviously in the back half of last year and our guidance assumes that as well. But, we also demonstrated the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. And so, if you just -- we don\u2019t give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And, that expense growth that we\u2019re assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we\u2019re making in the business, discretionary go to market initiatives, all of the things we\u2019re doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so, that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model. And I\u2019ll end my question with one data point that I think is reflective of how successful that model is. And so, you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So, for every new dollar of revenue we\u2019re bringing in, it\u2019s got a higher margin on it than what the rest of the business does. That\u2019s a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that\u2019s why that even in a year, like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still at least guide to a point where we\u2019re expecting modest operating margin expansion. David Togut : Thanks so much. And congrats, John again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Hey. Thank you very much. And I\u2019m really starting to feel clumsy with my phone. I wanted to ask John. And Dan, obviously chime in where appropriate. But, you alluded and mentioned specifically, John kind of your guidance and that kind of thing for this year. If you think back and just over the last few months, even of the fourth quarter, there\u2019s been just a huge amount of volatility in closures and what consumers were doing or could do or couldn\u2019t do, et cetera. So, how are you trying to think about, like all those puts and takes, as you formulate your full year \u201821 outlook today? And what are the things maybe that you\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve gone through, particularly the latter few months of \u201820, that kind of give you confidence in our forecasting methodology is pretty sound, at least from where we stand right now? John Rainey : Sure, James. The revenue guide of 19% growth for the year, we sit here in February of 2021, and there\u2019s still uncertainty. There\u2019s uncertainty with the level of stimulus measures, the pace of the vaccine rollout. But there are some things that we\u2019ve seen that certainly give a lot more confidence than where we stood nine months ago, sort of at the peak of the, concern and trepidation that people had around what could happen to the economy and the impact on everyone\u2019s respective company. Some of the trends that we\u2019re seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they\u2019re definitely sustainable. And there\u2019s this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space. But, we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There is not a range around it, like we normally do, because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It\u2019s -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But, we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think, it\u2019s important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so, we\u2019re not just reliant on one thing. And I\u2019ll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel and events vertical. So, I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there is pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. And so, we\u2019re assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. But channel things aren\u2019t, if that\u2019s not the case, then likely there\u2019s been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business. So it\u2019s -- I know it\u2019s 11 months out that we\u2019re projecting here. But, as we\u2019ve moved through this, we\u2019ve got more confident with some of the trends that we\u2019re seeing and feel really good about that guide. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian of Baird. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon, everyone. A lot of good stuff here, but hoping you could provide a little more color on the strategy to build out the presence in China? How you see the combination of GoPay and PayPal position from a competitive standpoint, both within the country as well as the cross-border perspective? Dan Schulman : Thanks for the question, Colin. So, obviously, we\u2019re really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we\u2019re the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive. Very recently, Deputy Governor Pan from the PBOC, an article in the Financial Times that was really kind of this clear statement of China\u2019s commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we\u2019ve got both, safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have three goals over the next couple of years in China. So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in two directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China that Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts could be some unbranded full-stack processing. It could be QR codes. For instance, I\u2019ll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There\u2019s going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don\u2019t necessarily have to download WeChat Pay or Ant. They can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants. And I think, there\u2019s a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Dan Dolev of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : A question for Dan, really kind of looking into the long term. It looks like PayPal is increasingly becoming sort of, in my view, the world\u2019s best super app, especially now that you\u2019re offering bitcoin, QR, Buy Now Pay Later and counting. Can you maybe talk a little bit what you\u2019re seeing in terms of engagement that brings PayPal closer to becoming an everyday super app? Maybe touch on your broader engagement strategy given 73 million accounts that you added in 2020? And what are your long-term digital wallet ambitions as you introduce traditional functionality and services? Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yes. Dan, that\u2019s a great question, kind of goes at the heart of a lot of our strategy. And we\u2019re going to be talking a lot about that at our Investor Day next week as well. So, let me just very quickly say that we are seeing engagement levels already. I talked about it. If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We\u2019ve never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we\u2019re at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we\u2019ve put into place, whether that be crypto or that Buy Now Pay Later, the Venmo card, QR codes, are adding to usage. They\u2019re adding incremental TPV, they\u2019re adding incremental transactions, ones that I didn\u2019t mention is that people who use a PayPal product in-store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we\u2019re seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store that don\u2019t displace the online. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so, as we start to build out our digital wallet really into the super app, that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations. I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it\u2019s going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments. So, I think, Dan, thank you for that great closing question. And I want to thank everybody for your time today. And I really hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And we are looking forward to speaking with all of you again next week at our Investor Day. So, thank you for your time. And everybody, take care. Bye, bye.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that on the heels of the strongest year in PayPal's history, we just completed our strongest quarter ever with record financial and operating results. Customers across the world have clearly embraced the digital economy, and PayPal has become an essential platform for both consumers and merchants. Consequently, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our annual targets for revenue, EPS, TPV and net new active accounts. As much of the world begins to shift its attention towards a post-pandemic recovery, we continue to see strong demand for a comprehensive set of services from both our merchants and consumers. Over the coming year, we will accelerate our customers' digital engagement through the rapid innovation of our digital wallet and merchant commerce platform. Our addressable market continues to significantly expand, driven by accelerating secular trends and the proactive steps we are taking to become a full commerce and payments platform. We believe that the shift in consumer digital behavior will remain essentially unchanged in a post-COVID world. Consumers have expanded their digital lives into a seamless online and offline experience. Our products are an essential enabler of the digital economy, and our mission to shape a future where everyone can participate fully in this new digital paradigm has never been more important. Our Q1 trends are strong across the board and were further accelerated by favorable comps from a year ago. Our TPV grew by 50% on a spot basis, or 46% on an FXN basis to $285 billion. eBay now represents 5.5% of our volume, and we expect their TPV to be approximately 3% of total volumes by year-end. Excluding eBay, our MS volumes grew by an all-time high of 54% on a spot basis and 50% on an FXN basis. Our transactions in the quarter were approximately 4.4 billion, growing 34% year-over-year. We added 14.5 million net new active accounts, ending the quarter with 392 million active accounts, up 21% year-over-year. We added 1.4 million new merchants in the quarter, continuing the heightened pace from prior quarters, and we now have 31 million merchant accounts on our platform. By the end of Q2, we expect to exceed 400 million active accounts. And for the year, we now believe our NNAs will be between 52 million to 55 million, up from our previous expectations of approximately 50 million last quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see our transactions per active account begin to accelerate due to increased engagement across our portfolio. Normalizing for Honey, our Q1 TPA grew by 8.3% year-over-year to 44.1. We generated $6.033 billion of revenue in Q1, growing a record 31% spot and 29% on an FXN basis. eBay revenues declined 12%, and we expect they will substantially complete their migration to manage payments by year-end. On the back of this strong revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP EPS in Q1 of $1.22, up 84%. Venmo continued its strong performance in Q1 with $51.4 billion of TPV, up 63% year-over-year. We recently launched the ability for Venmo customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. We are heavily investing in Venmo's commerce capabilities, which include rapidly upgrading the Pay with Venmo customer experience with initial rollout beginning this quarter. The Venmo credit card is outpacing our expectations for both new accounts and transactions. And we're also making it easier for small businesses and casual sellers to accept Venmo payments. We now have over 300,000 small business profiles currently established, including $200,000 in Q1 alone. Our Venmo Commerce TPV and revenue growth continued to accelerate, and we remain confident in our $900 million revenue target. We expect to roll out our next-generation digital wallet in Q3. It will be an all-in-one personalized app that will empower our users to make the most of their money and strengthen their financial lives every day. We will provide increasingly customized and unique shopping, financial services and payments experiences for our customers. Consumers are turning to brands that they trust when it comes to choosing a super app. That clearly plays into our strength as a recent external survey of over 300,000 consumers across the globe selected PayPal as the second most trusted brand in the world. Merchants continue to turn to PayPal in record numbers as we are now an essential platform to enable their transition into the digital economy. Small businesses who used PayPal during the peak of the pandemic saw their overall revenues grow by 25% versus a negative 9% for all other small businesses in the same time period. Small businesses who used PayPal last year drove 75% of their online sales from outside their local neighborhood, clearly expanding their addressable market. And 65% of small businesses in the U.S. who use PayPal have cross-border sales versus less than 5% of all other small businesses. Across the shopping journey, merchants who use PayPal see a substantial lift. According to market research reported by Nielsen, merchants with PayPal experienced 17% more repeat buyers. Their checkout completion goes up by 34%. And PayPal consumers spend an average of 12% more at PayPal merchants. And finally, PayPal consumers are loyal to PayPal merchants, buying 11% more often when PayPal is accepted. These are powerful facts that support our brand promise to retailers as we add more and more capabilities to our platform. For instance, our Buy Now, Pay Later product continues to move from strength to strength. In the short time from our launch, we've processed over $1 billion in TPV in the U.S. alone. Early results continue to show a significant 15% engagement lift in transactions and TPV. In addition, nearly 30,000 merchants have implemented our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities upstream on their product pages with a corresponding lift in our overall share of checkout. Demand for our PayPal and Venmo QR codes and in-store payments remains strong, with an additional merchant signing up every 28 seconds. We now have nearly 1 million merchants accepting our QR codes with continued momentum across our large enterprise merchants. Our early adopters of QRC are spending 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. Our overall in-store efforts across QR and cards equaled $6.4 billion in Q1. As I discussed during our Investor Day, we believe the current technological underpinnings of our financial system will be substantially upgraded over the coming years. Both cryptocurrencies and central bank-issued digital currencies can play a critical role in shaping a more inclusive recovery and a more equitable financial system. Our leadership in all forms of digital currency has been widely embraced, enabling numerous positive conversations with central banks, regulators and government officials around the world. I'm also pleased to share that we closed our Curv acquisition last month. And Curv's talented team will bolster our existing technology resources and accelerate our efforts to shape a new financial infrastructure that is efficient, low-cost and inclusive. We have an extensive road map ahead of us, and our innovation will be pursued in partnership with governments and in compliance with local, national and global regulatory frameworks. The expiration of our operating agreement with eBay has enabled us to launch an extensive partnership with Alibaba. This global agreement will enable hundreds of millions of consumers outside of China to shop across Alibaba sites in China. PayPal is now available as a payment method on Alibaba's wholesale marketplace as well as Ali Express, its global retail marketplace. We are excited at the pace of our current ramp and the ultimate potential of this new partnership. Additionally, our commercial agreement with FlutterWave enables businesses across Africa to have significantly more access to PayPal consumers in order to receive and make payments online. In this quarter, we also collaborated with TelR in the Middle East, allowing merchants in the UAE to accept PayPal for customers shopping online. These efforts serve to significantly broaden our reach and tap into rapidly growing marketplaces across the globe. We clearly have a lot of momentum as we exit Q1. We will continue to accelerate new product innovation throughout the year. Our increased expectations for 2021 reflect our conviction that we will continue to grow share and increase our addressable market by capitalizing on the accelerating shift to digital. I'd like to thank our employees who continue to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers. Their hard work drives our market leadership and positions us to continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I want to start by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding quarter. We recently marked 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the challenges that our teams have faced, our focus on execution and culture of collaboration are allowing us to deliver very strong results. We're off to a great start to the year. In Q1, we outperformed on both revenue and earnings and built on our operational and financial momentum exiting 2020. In looking at our results for the quarter, the year-over-year growth rates benefit from the comparison to a softer March last year when we absorbed the most meaningful negative COVID impact. That said, our business is growing at structurally faster rates than pre-pandemic. And as a result, we're raising our guidance for this year. Before discussing our updated outlook, I'd like to highlight our Q1 results. Total payment volume grew 50% at spot and 46% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've ever reported. Our Q1 TPV grew at a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 33%, accelerating from 30% in Q4 and reflecting our strong momentum in user growth. Notably, while we typically experience a sequential decline in volumes from Q4 to Q1, this year, our volume grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. Versus the first quarter last year, merchant services volume grew 50% currency-neutral. And volume contributed by eBay marketplaces declined 3% on the same basis. In Q1, eBay represented 5.5% of our volume, down 53 basis points sequentially and down 260 basis points from Q1 last year. Revenue increased a record 31% on spot basis and 29% currency neutral to $6 billion. Transaction revenue grew 33% to $5.6 billion, representing 20 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis and 8 points of acceleration sequentially. Strong performance across core PayPal, Braintree and Venmo drove these results. Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 42%, indicative of the ongoing strength of our diversified 2-sided platform. Other value-added services revenue grew 2% on a spot basis and 1% currency neutral to $412 million. These results were driven by strengthening credit performance, which was partially offset by lower interest income on customer balances. In the first quarter, transaction take rate was 1.97%, and total take rate was 2.11%. Nearly 1/3 of the 24 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted from the mix effect of eBay. A reduction of $101 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges, growth in bill payment volumes and accelerating Venmo volumes also contributed to this decline. The 31 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower growth in other value-added services revenue. Volume-based expense performance was the strongest in our history. These expenses increased only 9% to $2.5 billion on 31% revenue growth. As a result, transaction margin dollars grew 52% in the first quarter, and transaction margin reached 57.8%. Normalizing for the macroeconomic-related credit loss provisioning last year, transaction margin dollars grew 38%. Going into the expense highlights. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to a record low of 80 basis points, driven by both volume and funding mix. Continued improvements in our risk decisioning and mitigation strategies resulted in transaction losses improving 3 basis points to another record low rate of 10 basis points overall. In discussing our credit losses for the quarter, I want to provide additional context given the increased provisioning last year and the complexity in the year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, we increased reserves by $227 million for expected credit losses due to the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. After taxes, this represented a negative $0.17 per share impact. During 2020, we increased our reserve coverage ratio and ended the year at 23%. In addition, our gross receivables balance declined from $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter last year to $3.6 billion at the end of 2020. Tightened underwriting and strong repayment activity contributed to lower balances in our merchant loan portfolio. This decline was partially offset by growth in our consumer portfolio. These trends continued in the first quarter of 2021, and we ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in receivables. More favorable economic conditions and portfolio performance resulted in a partial release of reserves in Q1. This reserve release benefited credit losses by approximately $87 million and provided an approximate $0.06 benefit to EPS. As a result, at the end of the first quarter, our reserve coverage ratio declined to 21%. In the quarter, nontransaction-related operating expenses increased 31% and represented 30% of revenue, remaining essentially flat to last year. We are prioritizing growth. And to advance our key initiatives, we're continuing to invest more in sales and marketing and technology and development. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $1.67 billion, and our operating margin was 27.7%, our strongest performance for any first quarter. Normalizing only for the macro-related provisioning last year, operating income grew 46% and operating margin expanded approximately 300 basis points. In Q1, on this normalized basis and inclusive of our elevated investment spend, we earned an incremental $0.38 of operating income for every additional dollar of revenue generated. Non-GAAP other income declined by $39 million relative to last year. This was driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was largely offset by a lower effective tax rate. For the first quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 84% to $1.22. Again, normalizing for the $0.17 negative impact last year related to increased credit provisioning, non-GAAP EPS still grew 47%. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.1 billion. In addition, we generated $1.54 billion in free cash flow, representing 27% growth from the first quarter last year. For every dollar of revenue in the first quarter, we generated $0.25 of free cash flow. Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2021 and our guidance for the second quarter. This updated outlook reflects our ability to accelerate growth at scale at increasing rates of profitability as well as the underlying strength of our core business. For the full year 2021, based on our record first quarter performance and sustained momentum, we are raising our net new active TPV revenue and earnings outlook. Relative to our prior expectations, eBay's managed payments transition has accelerated, and we now expect a greater percentage of the migration to be complete by the end of the third quarter. This acceleration puts more near-term pressure on our revenue and earnings growth. At the same time, this more compressed timing allows for a cleaner exit in 2021. Broad-based strength in our Merchant Services business and improving credit performance allowed us to more than offset this impact. We now expect revenue to be approximately $25.75 billion for a growth of approximately 20% on a spot basis for the year. We are raising our expectations for revenue growth by 1 point while at the same time absorbing an additional 2 points of pressure to revenue growth from eBay. In addition, we expect to generate approximately 100 basis points of operating margin expansion this year relative to the more modest margin expansion we had guided at the start of the year. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $4.70, representing growth of approximately 21%. Relative to the guidance we provided at the start of the year, this is an additional 4 points of non-GAAP earnings growth in 2021. We're executing from a position of strength and seeing strong adoption of our new products and services. Our updated guidance includes increased investment in our digital wallet initiatives to drive further innovation, adoption and engagement. The strong underlying trends in our business and Q1 outperformance are allowing us to offset these incremental investments and the more pronounced eBay headwinds to deliver stronger earnings growth than we previously expected. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $6.25 billion, representing approximately 19% growth at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to be approximately $1.12, representing growth of approximately 5%. As a reminder, last year, operating margin expanded more than 500 basis points in the second quarter. Favorable volume and funding mix dynamics, combined with COVID-related underspend and nontransaction-related expenses, contributed to the strong margin performance and resulted in 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS. This record growth last year creates a tougher comparison. On a 2-year compound annual basis, our earnings guidance reflects 25% growth. I'd also like to discuss our updated net new active outlook. We're raising our guidance for 2021 net new active accounts. Based on the 14.5 million additional accounts in Q1 and our current trends, we now expect to add in the range of 52 million to 55 million net new users this year. This is an increase from the 50 million net new actives that we guided to start the year. On top of the approximately 73 million users added last year, at our current pace, we'll add more new users between last year and this year than we did in 2016, '17, '18 and '19 combined. As a reminder, in Q2 last year, we added 21.3 million accounts and are now lapping this growth. Given this tougher comp, and the ramp of our initiatives throughout the year, we expect Q2 net new actives to be lower than Q1 and for Q3 and Q4 adds to be sequentially stronger. It's worth noting a couple of points related to our guidance and our business overall. First, the environment in which we are operating, while more stable than a year ago, continues to be very dynamic and more challenging to predict than in normal times. In many of our core markets, we're on the threshold of some degree of a return to normalcy. People are getting vaccinated. There's a return to physical experiences. Travel is resuming. Some of this is certainly pent-up demand from the void that resulted from COVID-19 over the last year. For some, perhaps it may be a reversion to the way things were prior to 2020. The pace and degree of this change and its impact on the trends on our business is challenging to predict from 1 quarter to the next with the same level of certainty that we have in normal times. This brings me to my second point, which is unassailable. Our business has and will continue to benefit from the changes in consumer behavior that have resulted from this pandemic, namely, the acceleration of the continuing trend of the growth in e-commerce penetration and importantly, the growing ubiquity of digital payment experiences. We continue to see elevated e-commerce spending well above pre-pandemic levels, even in countries and markets that have begun to reopen. We're positioned to be a long-term beneficiary of these secular trends and as we've repeatedly said, are investing heavily to help shape this outcome. That said, our short-term forecasting is susceptible to more variability than normal. To wrap up, our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength, diversification and relevance of our scaled, two-sided global platform. We extended our leadership position in digital payments and delivered some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and relative basis. And our strong trends across the business reflect enduring secular trends and continued business momentum. We're continuing to invest aggressively to drive accelerated growth in a post-pandemic world and capture the significant opportunity ahead. At the same time, our meaningful scale enables us to realize additional efficiencies, expand our operating margin and support significant free cash flow generation. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Hey, thanks, guys, and great results here. When we look at coming out of last year's record NNAs, we thought 50 million was a good number, and now you're raising that. If you could just touch on the dynamics you're seeing around the net new actives, what's driving the upside even after these kinds of record rates? And especially as we go into reopening in the market, can you just talk through the activity and the churn levels? And then maybe on the other side of the funnel, if you could touch on the incremental users coming on, even as the world reopens, is it partnerships like Alibaba you mentioned today or other kinds of international? Or just really what's the big driving force for that confidence? Thanks, guys. Dan Schulman : I think maybe I'll start with the answer to that, Darrin, and then see if John wants to supplement anything. We had a strong Q1. It's up 46% ex the one-time Honey adds that we had last year. Ended the quarter with 31 million merchants, 392 million active accounts. We're really getting to a scale right now, Darrin, that has a huge network effect on it. We brought on in Q1, two new customers every second throughout the quarter. We brought on a new merchant every five seconds throughout the quarter. We brought in somewhere between 1.4 million, 1.5 million new merchants. That was up over 100% from a year ago. And I think of the drivers, it's predominantly PayPal's, it\u2019s predominantly still in our core markets, still seeing great growth from Venmo. But my view on net new actives is I say without being too aggressive here, look, I think we have a lot of opportunity yet here. We have a lot of expansion into international markets. I think our marketing programs are really beginning to deliver excellent results. I think we're just scratching the surface there. And when I think about what's going on inside the base, our engagement levels are going up substantially. I mean, you saw kind of our TPA grow by 7%. If you normalize for Honey, our TPA went up 8% in the quarter. But if you normalize for the huge amount of NNAs that John just talked about, because when you put on huge amounts of NNAs, and they don't have the full year to do their full TPA, maybe a bunch came on this quarter and they had 1.5 months to do transactions, and we count them in that TPA. But if you normalize that to say the $37 million we used to be doing, then that TPA grew by 14% in the quarter. And that is really a result of our daily active users coming on. Our daily active users were up 33% in Q1 across the base, but our new products and services right now are driving huge engagement levels. I'll just give you a couple of examples. Buy Now, Pay Later, I'm sure somebody will talk about it later because we have a lot of fun things to talk about. But 50% of the customers who have used Buy Now, Pay Later have repeated within three months and 70% have repeated within six months. If you look at our in-store cohort now, they're driving an incremental 60 to 120 incremental transactions. And we talked about this last call, and it's holding true. About half of our crypto users open their app every single day. And so we're clearly beginning to see both at the top of the funnel, the potential for increases into the top of the funnel and really narrowing the bottom of the funnel, which is why I'm bullish on -- actually our NNA trends. The one thing I'd point out, Darrin, that I think is really important is the cadence of those NNAs. Q1 was a good solid quarter for us. Q2 is always going to be the lowest quarter of the year because we did 21.4 million net new actives last year. Even though our churn rates are down, and that was one of the best cohorts we ever activated, it puts incremental pressure at the bottom of the funnel for Q2. And then we see really increasing amounts of NNAs as we go through the year. So in general, really strong on the NNA front, really strong on the engagement front. And hopefully, more of that to come. John Rainey : Yes. I'll just add real quickly, Darrin. Like if you go back to a year ago or maybe three quarters ago, when you saw the record amount of net new actives that came in the second quarter, I mean I think that -- I mean, candidly probably surprised everybody, right? That was an enormous number. And then you think about it sort of like, \"Okay, well, now what?\" Because we've got to make sure that we're engaging these customers and they're using us in all the ways that they can. And we -- even going back to that point in time, a year ago, we knew that the second quarter this year was going to be our toughest comp from a net new active perspective. Even as Dan said, despite the improvements we've made in reducing churn, there's still a lot of pressure there. And so Q2 is going to be sort of the low point for the year for us. And then we expect 3Q and 4Q to see strengthening acceleration there. But the thing that I will say that sort of gives us confidence in this, and we've talked about this for a period of time, but we've consistently said that these have been our most engaged cohorts that we've ever seen. And we're continuing to see those trends. They haven't waned like what you might expect related to people returning to the physical world. And so that gives us the conviction around raising this and really what it bodes for the rest of our business as well. Darrin Peller : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks, again, guys. Congrats again. John Rainey : Yes. Thanks, Darrin. Operator : Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you. Thank you. Really impressive results on many fronts. I wanted to ask on the first quarter revenue. So you beat your revenue guidance, looks like, by 3 percentage points. I think that's the widest margin of upside we've seen in a few quarters. So I'm curious, what surprised you? Can you rank for us what surprised you? What drove the upside? And how does it change your revenue outlook for the year? It sounds like it's enough to offset the bigger eBay drag, but would love it if you could rank it for us maybe. Thanks. John Rainey : Yes. Tien-Tsin, do you want me to start, Dan? Dan Schulman : Yes. John Rainey : So I think starting with the full year, you're right. The momentum that we're seeing in the business really has allowed us to overcome the headwinds that we're seeing from a more accelerated migration for eBay to its managed payments. To specifically address your question on Q1, there's actually a handful of things that, I think, performed differently than what we expected. Starting with January. So there was an extended holiday shopping period. Like the first couple of weeks of January, we saw much stronger e-commerce activity than normal. On sort of the other book end, getting to March, we saw a resumption in travel that happened quicker than -- more quickly than what we had estimated. And then sort of in between that, you've got the stimulus. And I don't want to overstate the effect of stimulus because we had assumed some of that in our forecast. I think it was pretty clear at that point in time that, that was going to happen. But I think fundamentally, if you step back and you think about these things that I described that maybe are more transitory, what has been I think a more permanent shift is what we're seeing around, call it, the displacement of cash. And you're just seeing more and more digital experiences that are replacing cash. So I'll give you one sort of silly example, Tien-Tsin, but last Saturday night, I went out to dinner. And a restaurant had reopened, I'm sitting inside. And when it gets time for me to get my check, I'm not handing off my credit card to the waiter for them to run and put it through the machine. They're printing a receipt with the QR code on it right there. That's a physical world experience that's happening digitally. And this is the transformation that is happening right in front of our eyes right now. We are on the threshold of this. And that's fundamentally, I think it's a small anecdote, but it's -- I think it's a good example of kind of what we're seeing in our business, where there's this convergence of online and off-line that is really benefiting our business. Dan Schulman : I'll just add on to that, John, because I think that is the strength that we're seeing even in markets that are opening. If you think about, we did a 100-point raise in guidance for revenues, you had 200 incremental points of pressure from eBay. That's really, in effect, a 30-point raise on our core business. And that's because we are now seeing people living a digital life. And what used to be and for us as well, like 1 year, 1.5 years ago is there was a separate distinction between in-store or the physical world and e-commerce in the online world. And now what we're seeing is that it's just a digital world. Even as economies open, more and more of those payments are moving to digital. Think about it, like Uber would be a good example. As more and more rides start there, they're moving into a physical environment, but it's all done through a digital platform and digital payments. And so clearly, that is something that we see as a sustaining and growing trend going forward. And I think John mentioned cash is definitely being replaced. There's just a study done a week or 2 ago by one of the major networks that said anywhere between 60% to 70% of consumers are going to use cash less frequently, and that's moving to digital. It's moving to digital forms of payment, and it's moving to P2P. And by the way, when it moves to digital, it's moving predominantly to debit, which obviously is also great from a funding perspective on that. And so I think we have this portfolio of services right now, whether it be Zettle or Braintree or QR codes or just what's happening in the physical world that complements now what's happening in the online world with our more traditional products. And that's kind of a 1-, 2-punch that I don't think any of us really understood the extent of or the depth of the transition to a digital economy. John Rainey : And just if I can add one more thing. For those reasons that Dan mentioned, it's also why we are investing as heavily as we are. At no point in time in our 6 years as a public company, have we invested as heavily as we are right now because we want to capitalize on these secular tailwinds, and we think it's really important. And that's why you see us not rolling through the entirety of that in terms of our EPS guidance because we think it's more important to invest right now, and that is clearly our bias. And fortunately for us, we're able to do that while still expanding our operating margin in terms of our guidance 100 basis points for the year. Operator : Your next question will come from Lisa Ellis from MoffetNathanson. Lisa Ellis : I had a follow-up on your comments, Dan, on digital currencies and their ability to potentially drive financial inclusion globally. As you're engaging with governments around the world that are experimenting with CBDCs, how are they thinking about the role of the private sector? And specifically, what role or roles could you see PayPal plain? Meaning, more broadly, how should we think about how CBDCs could impact your business? Dan Schulman : Yes. So we have had quite a number of conversations here in the U.S. and really across the world with the leaders of those regulatory bodies and some of the key players in government. I won't kind of obviously talk about the specifics of any of our conversations that we've had with them. What I would say is it is a conversation that is very much one of learning from each other, understanding the capabilities that each of us have, what some of the concerns that some of the central banks might have or governments, what some of the benefits of a platform like PayPal could do in various forms of how CBDCs could be issued. And I believe based on all my conversations that each country is going to go at different speeds. We're going to have different regulatory oversight in it. But there isn't one country around the world in which we've engaged in, where I don't think that they're envisioning a future that isn't one of a digitized Fiat currency. I think, obviously, there's a lot of synergy with digital wallets. There's a lot of interesting things as you think about next-generation technology that can add utility to payments, that can take down perhaps cost, the elimination of unnecessary intermediaries and certainly can speed the time in which somebody can access their money. So we've got a tremendous amount of really great results going on tactically with our cryptocurrency efforts right now. And we're excited about those. We're investing in those. But this whole idea around establishing a digital currency and blockchain business unit inside PayPal is to think about what is the financial system going to start to move towards? And how can we be a shaper of that, a leader within that and not a reactor to how that's happening. And that -- those conversations have been -- have gone well beyond my expectations in terms of the openness of governments and central banks to think about new ways of managing and moving money through the system. Lisa Ellis : Pretty exciting. Dan Schulman : It is actually, yes. Operator : Next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I had a question on the reopening trends seen thus far this year. And any discernible trends that you might have observed, like how it's affecting volume mix, funding mix and just overall engagement with the PayPal ecosystem? John Rainey : Sure, Sanjay. I'll start there and Dan may want to add a little bit. I think there's a number of things there that we're observing. I think building on your question around debit, that's certainly something that stands out. We see a shift in funding towards more debit versus credit, and that's across our broad portfolio of products, but a good example is even like Buy Now, Pay Later, where in the previous quarter, about 78% of that was funded with debit. That moved up to 82% in the most recent quarter. And so clearly, we're seeing a shift there. And again, going back to an earlier answer, we believe some of that is the displacement of cash. In terms of overall kind of trends that we're seeing around reopening, certainly, travel has picked back up. And that happened a little bit earlier than what we had anticipated. Among the verticals that sort of stand out, fashion still is one of the single largest growth verticals in terms of overall volume for us. But in terms of the highest year-over-year growth rates, still food and groceries, and incidentally, even in markets where you've seen some reopening. So again, it just -- it really supports what consumers have been telling the world in surveys for 12 months now. Now we're seeing it in behaviors. And so again, this sort of plays into a lot of the themes that we're talking about here in terms of this convergence of the physical world and online and the need to have these omni experiences for your customers. But those will be a couple of things that I would call out that we're seeing. Operator : Your next question will come from Colin Sebastian of Baird. Colin Robert : How you're feeling at this point about the original full year revenue target for that business? And related to that, if you have any feedback on how crypto integration and business profiles are impacting how people are using Venmo? And if you could just remind us how the pipeline of other enhancements to the app will sequence over the course of the year. Dan Schulman : Yes, sure. So first of all, Venmo had another really strong quarter. TPV, up 63%. It's off to a great start in Q2 as well. One really interesting thing on that John and I were remarking on the other day, is if you look at the annualized TPV of Venmo right now, call it about $205 million, $210 billion of TPV. Think back when we went public, our TPV for the year was $285 billion. So you basically have another PayPal inside of PayPal when we went public a year ago. And there is such huge monetization opportunity on that. I think, obviously, we feel very confident in the $900 million, but that is scratching the surface of what Venmo can be. This is a huge base that's growing. And the great thing is that the team there is executing on all of their initiatives. Credit card, we knew is a great experience, but it's performing beyond our expectations, new sign-ups, transactions. That's what happens when you have a great value proposition consumer experience. Crypto launched at 1% ramp. It just went to 5% ramp. It will be 100% ramped by the end of this month, the end of May. And obviously, if you look at again surveys that have come out recently and you look at millennials, something like 74% of them anticipate that they're going to use crypto in the next year or 2 in some way. Business profiles growing above plan. We're going to be introducing things like goods and services by our protection. That's a huge revenue generator on the PayPal P2P side. That same thing will be happening on the Venmo side. Pay with Venmo, which by the way, is very little of this year's $900 million. But that Pay with Venmo is going to be the majority of revenues as you look out several years from now. And so we're really excited about that rolling out. And eventually, Venmo is going to move down the same path that the PayPal super app digital wallet is going down. It's going to become a super app itself, putting in more and more capabilities and services around, again, shopping and basic consumer financial services and payments. It has international expansion in front of it. And there's just so much opportunity. I think we've all been bullish on the potential of Venmo. We are now beginning to see it realized and we just think that -- just want to keep investing in that because the opportunity is quite large. Operator : Our next question will come from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Good to see the strong growth engagement from Buy Now, Pay Later customers. Can you talk about your expectations for Buy Now, Pay Later for the balance of this year? More broadly, how you expect the most engaged Buy Now, Pay Later customers to engage in the PayPal ecosystem overall? Dan Schulman : Yes, sure. I'll start, and then maybe John can go in. First of all, it's a great value proposition in the market. I think everybody clearly understands that and sees that. It's no incremental cost for a merchant to have Buy Now, Pay Later. It's just part of their take rate easy, integration. And by the way, PayPal is a trusted brand. So consumers see it, they recognize it, they have no problems taking part in that value proposition. And because we have now 392 million customers on the platform, we know them. We know their behaviors. We have higher approval rates and less defaults than what we are seeing out in the Buy Now, Pay Later space. Just to give you a sense of results in front of that. Over $2 billion of TPV globally since launch. Over $1 billion in the U.S. Over 14 million loans have been done, over 5 million unique customers. We have over 500,000 unique merchants, more -- hundreds of LE customers, as I mentioned, 30,000 upstream, and that's growing every single day. And one of the great things we're seeing with customers that are engaging with Buy Now, Pay Later is there's a 15% halo lift in TPV on the platform. And because of funding it with debit, debit's increasing, there's like a 16% reduction in our cost per transaction. So it's a great proposition for merchants tons of conversations going on with all the leading merchants, big uptick with consumers, and we're going to expand into Australia by the end of Q2 and in much more of Europe by the end of the year. David Togut : Thanks for all those great metrics. Just a quick follow-up on bottom of the funnel impact from the growth of Buy Now Pay Later. Dan Schulman : Yes. Well, again, it's a little bit early because we've launched all of these things in like the last 6 or 8 months or so. So given we look at 12-month actives. So -- but if you look at the repeat behavior and the increased engagement, that probably bodes pretty well for both TPA and churn reduction, especially given that this is now scaling quite -- this is meaningful scale even for a company of our size. Operator : Your next question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I wanted to ask, John, on the impressive operating leverage, and we saw the raise of non-GAAP operating margins to -- I think it's about 100 basis points. So just thinking about what caused the increase in confidence there? And even though eBay is a bigger headwind and you're investing more, you're still increasing operating margins. So there's a lot of things going in the positive direction there. So I'd just like to get the details from you. Dan Schulman : Happy to address that, Bryan. So again, I want to repeat the number because it's a whopping number. 38% incremental operating margins in the quarter. That's -- it really demonstrates the scalability of our platform, particularly when you think about the level of investment that we've had internally, and you can look at some of the year-over-year comps in our expense line items and get an idea of that. But I think there's a number of different areas, but a couple that obviously stand out are the transaction-related operating expenses of transaction expense and transaction loss. To have record lows in both those, again, like the improvements that we've made in our risk capabilities to drive down transaction losses has just been tremendous. And we start talking about this probably 5 or 6 quarters ago. And look, I don't know if we're going to come in at 10 basis points every quarter. I certainly would hope so. But that is a performance that was really hard to imagine a couple of years ago. But the improvements there that we've made in terms of the capabilities are definitely sustainable. On transaction expense, look, I think you can pick at any one part of our P&L. And like -- take rate as an example. We saw declines there. Some of that's related to mix, like we're obviously doing, as an example, more bill payment right now, which carries a lower take rate. Well, at the same time, it carries a lower transaction expense. And so we've always focused on that margin between the 2. And again, to have a margin, a transaction margin approaching 60% this quarter, we're really pleased about it. And so the obvious question is where does that level out over time? Does it go down from 80 basis points, does it go up from 80 basis points. It's tough to tell, but I certainly don't think that we're going to see levels that we saw pre-pandemic. There may be some inflation. But I think all of the mix changes in our business and what we're seeing around the pull forward of e-commerce, we would expect transaction expense to remain at lower levels pre-pandemic, which, again, gives us the just amazing leverage that we have on this platform. Operator : That was the last question for the call today. I will now pass the call back to Dan for closing remarks. Dan Schulman : Yes. Thanks so much. Thanks you everybody, for all of your questions, and thank you for the time you spent with us today. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. We look forward to not just speaking to all of you soon, but hopefully seeing all of you soon as well. So again, thank you for your time. Take care and goodbye.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter 2021. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Wena. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2021. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2021. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, July 28, 2021. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that on the heels of a record year, our Q2 results once again reflect some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and a relative basis. It is now clear that customers around the world have embraced all forms of digital payments, even in regions where in-person activities are returning towards pre-pandemic levels. In this new normal PayPal serves as an essential and trusted platform for both consumers and merchants across all forms of commerce, payments, and basic financial services. As a result, we hit a new milestone in Q2, surpassing $300 billion of TPV for the first time in our history, growing 40% on a spot basis to $311 billion with an annualized run rate of approximately $1.25 trillion. This is even more notable given that eBay's TPV on our platform declined by 37%. eBay exited the quarter at under 4% of our volume and we expect their TPV will approach 2.5% of our total volumes by year-end. Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by a remarkable 48% on a spot basis. Our active accounts now exceed $400 million, up 16% to $403 million. We added $11.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, including an additional $1.5 million merchant accounts. That brings our total merchant count to $32 million. We still expect to end the year at the higher end of our previous guidance of $52 million to $55 million net new active accounts. Transactions in the quarter grew by 27% to $4.74 billion. And even as our net new actives continue to show strong growth, our transactions per active account accelerated 11% in the quarter to 43.5 times as our consumers engage more frequently across our growing suite of services. We grew our revenues by 19% to $6.24 billion. This growth comes even as we lap strong results from last year and absorbed 811 basis points of revenue pressure from eBay, as their revenues on our platform declined 51% in Q2. Excluding eBay, our revenues grew at approximately 32%. We now expect that eBay will be essentially 100% complete with their migration to managed payments by the end of the third quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance despite the fact that this accelerated ramp puts an additional 100 basis points of revenue pressure in 2021. The good news is that this pressure begins to ease in Q4, and obviously positions us for accelerated revenue growth in 2022. Finally, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.15 even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives. Venmo continued its strong performance in Q2 with $58 billion in TPV, up 58% year-over-year, with over 76 million active accounts. Revenue growth accelerated almost 70% in Q2, our highest growth rate in the past year, fueled by Venmo's product diversification strategy. More than 500,000 customers have established new business profiles on Venmo, with more than 300,000 created in Q2 alone. Pay with Venmo revenues grew by 183% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong adoption in trading of crypto on Venmo, and this quarter, we expanded the Venmo value proposition to allow merchants and consumers to pay for goods and services and receive buyer and seller protections for commerce transactions. This has been a very successful future on PayPal's P2P services and we expect it will be widely adopted on Venmo. I'm pleased to report that the initial version of our new consumer wallet, Super App, is code complete and we are now beginning to slowly ramp. In the next several months, we plan to be fully ramped in the U.S. with a host of products and services across payments, basic consumer financial services and commerce and shopping tools launching every quarter. New features will include high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, new and improved Bill Pay functionality, messaging capabilities outside of P2P to enable family and friend communications, as well as additional crypto capabilities and customized deals and offers. Each wallet will be unique, driven by our advanced AI and machine learning capabilities in order to enhance each customer's experiences and opportunities. As I previously mentioned, 32 million merchants now rely on PayPal. They trust that our scale, security tools and resources will help them to grow their businesses in today's rapidly emerging digital economy. PayPal is the only payments company to offer features like global seller protection and fraud prevention services at no additional cost. We are one of the few payments companies to allow consumers to use cryptocurrency as a funding source to check out on our platform. Our Buy Now, Pay Later offering comes at no additional cost to merchants, while boosting their conversion rates and increasing cart sizes by 39%. And we continue to expand our product differentiation through recent acquisitions like Chargehound and Happy Returns, that will drive additional value to both consumers and merchants post a sales transaction. Our announced pricing adjustments in the U.S. align our pricing with the value we deliver, while giving us flexibility to aggressively compete in full stack processing and at point-of-sale checkout. We continue to see strong demand for our in-store services with approximately 1.3 million merchants now accepting our QR codes and continued momentum and excitement across our large enterprise merchants. In fact every 20 seconds a new merchant signs up to use our QR codes. It's also very encouraging to see that consumers who use our QR codes spend more TPV. In fact 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. Our in-store efforts will no doubt be a multi-year journey, but these trends reinforce our conviction to be a seamless omnichannel wallet. In Q2, our overall in-store efforts across QR and parts equaled $6.3 billion in TPV, up 39% year-over-year. Our in-store suite of services continues to expand with the launch of PayPal's iZettle in the US as in Europe PayPal Now offer small businesses in the US an integrated commerce solution that not only helps them to accept payments in store with the Zettle card reader but also helps them to manage sales and inventory across their various channels, all in one place. Our Buy Now, Pay Later product continues its strong growth and is proving to be extremely popular for consumers and merchants alike. Since launch, we have processed over $3.5 billion in TPV, with more than $1.5 billion of that TPV in Q2 alone. Approximately 650,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities and 40,000 have positioned Buy Now, Pay Later upstream on their product pages. Over 7 million consumers have transacted more than 20 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later product. Australia is now fully deployed and off to a strong start with additional countries in Europe, slated to rollout later this year. Our employees, customers and government officials expect PayPal to be a role model and a responsible corporate citizen. I'm proud to say that we are delivering on our commitments to advance social justice and racial equity. Over the past year, we have committed all of the $535 million we pledged towards advancing racial economic equality. And we recently launched a new $100 million commitment focused on women's economic empowerment. These efforts are a direct reflection of our values and our belief that PayPal must be part of a solution that drives a better future for all of us. I'd like to thank our employees for their passion and their never ending commitment for shaping a new and inclusive financial services system. We are entering a new era and we couldn't be more excited to help drive an emerging digital future where all small businesses and consumers can participate and thrive in a post-pandemic world. And with that let me turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. We are reporting another very strong quarter. Our results are indicative of the strength, diversification and breadth of our two-sided Global Payments Platform. PayPal sits at the intersection of digital transformation and e-commerce penetration. As the largest open platform for digital payments globally, we're uniquely positioned to address the opportunity that these secular tailwinds present. Over the past six quarters, our team's focus collaboration and resilience have allowed us to innovate at scale and deliver our best performance in company history. Globally the pace and shape of the recovery varies. As the environment continues to evolve we are evolving with it to serve the changing needs of our consumers and merchants. During the second quarter restrictions started to relax across our core markets, and we saw the beginning of a return to normalcy in consumer behavior, Consumers are spending again in verticals that had been severely affected and have become more comfortable shopping in person and dining out Merchants are repositioning for the post-pandemic world. Relative to our expectations, which were for reopening spend to closely track vaccination rates we've seen travel and events volumes return more rapidly. At the same time in markets that have reopened elevated e-commerce spending above pre-pandemic levels is ongoing and indicative of permanent shifts in consumer behavior On a two-year basis our business performance is remarkably consistent and very strong. Our second quarter results last year were exceptional. We grew revenue 22%, delivered a 28.2% operating margin and grew non-GAAP EPS 49%. Both the operating margin and earnings growth, were the best performance we've ever delivered it's remarkable that in the second quarter of this year when we're lapping this explosive growth, our business is continuing to perform at a very high level. Our results are even more impressive given the transitory headwinds we're facing from eBay this year. As part of eBay's managed payments transition we're absorbing a rapid migration of marketplaces volumes off of our platform. Further compounding this effect is the eBay benefited meaningfully from COVID last year, which makes the comparison this year even more difficult. For context from 2016 to 2019 the three-year compound annual growth rate for eBay Marketplaces revenue on our platform was approximately 2% and in 2020 this revenue grew 11% approximately 5 times faster Also worth highlighting is that through this period as eBay's contribution to our revenue declined from 22% to 13% we've expanded our operating margin 500 basis points given the accelerated pace of migration in 2021. There is a more pronounced effect on our operating margin and earnings growth profile this year. At the same time, this is truly a transitory effect on our results, which we now expect to be very largely contain to 2021 with much less of a tail into next year. And as we've discussed over the past several quarters, near-term forecasting continues to be complex given the global macroeconomic backdrop various stages of pandemic recovery and differing tasks of reopening. It's with this orientation in mindset that we head into the back half of 2021. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight for second quarter performance. Total payment volume grew 40% at spot and 36% on a currency neutral basis to $311 billion. Our Q2 TPV grew at a two-year compound annual growth rate of 34% accelerating from 33% in Q1 and indicative of the strong momentum in our business. Versus the second quarter last year Merchant Services volume grew 43% currency-neutral, a resurgence in travel and advance as well as core payment volumes contributed to this performance. This quarter, eBay had a much greater effect on our TPV then in the first quarter. In Q2, eBay marketplaces volumes declined 41% currency-neutral from last year. This is in comparison to a 3% decline last quarter. eBay represented 4% of our volume in Q2, down 512 basis points from last year. In addition to lapping elevated growth during the pandemic, we saw a faster ramp of the payments transition than what we had expected earlier this year, which resulted in a larger decline in Q2 volume. Given the speed at which we're seeing intermediation progress our plans now contemplate nearly 100% completion of the merchant migration by the end of the third quarter. This accelerated timeframe means that while we expect a similar drag to our volume revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter this impact lessens in Q4 and begins to tail off from there. As a result, we will have a much cleaner exit to 2021. Revenue increased 19% on a spot basis and 17% currency-neutral to $6.24 billion. Transaction revenue grew 17% to $5.8 billion and on a two-year basis transaction revenue grew 22.3% in Q2 versus 22.7% in Q1 of this year. In addition to the consistency of our results, this performance is even more remarkable excluding eBay. In the second quarter, eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 51% in comparison to Q2, '20 and 27% sequentially. Our revenue, excluding eBay, grew 32%, an 11 point acceleration from last year's already strong second quarter. Other value-added services revenue grew 40% on a spot basis and 36% currency-neutral to $441 million. These results were driven by strengthening credit performance and portfolio growth partially offset by lower interest income on customer balances. In the second quarter transaction take rate was 1.86% and total take rate was 2.01%. The mix effect of eBay contributed to more than a third of the 37 basis point reduction in take rate. The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 3.22% in comparison to 4.1% in Q2 last year. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees, a decline of $122 million from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue and growth in bill payment volumes. Bill payment is a vertical, characterized by both a lower take rate and an overall lower cost of funding than our e-commerce volumes, Q2 was another great quarter of volume based expense performance. Transaction expense came in at 81 basis points as a rate of TPV this year relative to 83 basis points last year. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was a record low 9 basis points versus 12 basis points in Q2 last year. The net effect credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter, inclusive of originations and reserve reversals resulted in a benefit of $104 million. In the quarter, we had an increase in loan origination activity and ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in gross receivables. reflecting sequential growth of 11%. Strong performance of our loan portfolio, improving macroeconomic trends and the mix of shorter duration originations from our instalment products resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 14.9% from 21.4% at the end of the first quarter. As a result, transaction margin dollars grew 19% in the second quarter and transaction margin reached 56.8%. I'd now like to cover our non-transaction related operating expenses. Overall, these expenses increased 27% and represented 30% of revenue. These are higher growth rates than what we've incurred historically, but as I suggested before, we believe that there has never been a more important time to invest in our business and the secular tailwinds in our business has perhaps never been stronger. In Q2, we again invested aggressively in product innovation and our go-to-market initiatives. Sales and marketing increased 68% in the quarter and technology and development spend grew 23%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 11% to $1.65 billion and our operating margin was 26.5%. This includes an approximately 12% or $360 million decline in transaction margin dollars from eBay Marketplaces. Normalizing for the reserve build last year and subsequent release this year, non-GAAP operating income declined 7% and operating margin was 23.9%. And on a two-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income is 29%. For the second quarter non-GAAP EPS grew 8% to $1.15. This includes an approximate $0.27 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces transaction margin dollars. Adjusting for our increased credit provisions last year and this year's release of reserves, EPS declined 9%. And on a two-year basis, this represents 27% earnings growth annually. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.4 billion and in addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the rest of 2021. Our business is performing exceedingly well, and overall, consistent with the outlook we provided on our last call. Given our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the back half, we're raising our TPV outlook and reiterating full year revenue and earnings. We now expect TPV growth to be in the range of 33% to 35% given the strong volume trends in our business. We continue to expect revenue for the year to be approximately $25.75 billion representing 20% growth on a spot basis. In addition, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $4.70 or growth of approximately 21%. We raised our 2021 revenue outlook by $250 million or approximately one point of growth when we reported our first quarter results in May. We're now absorbing more pressure from eBay than we had previously expected. Our current outlook contemplates an approximately seven point negative impact to revenue growth for the year. This corresponds to an approximately $0.85 negative impact to non-GAAP EPS from reduced transaction margin dollars. We're pleased that the strength of our platform, and the diversification of our business is allowing us to maintain this elevated outlook. In addition, we expect to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow or approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Now turning to guidance for the third quarter. This quarter we're up against our toughest revenue comparisons versus last year. In Q3 20, we reported 25% revenue growth, our strongest performance for the year. As a result of this dynamic as well as eBay's managed payments transition our plans had always assumed that in Q3 we would report our lowest level of quarterly revenue growth for the year. However, now planning for eBay's drag on our revenue growth to be greater than previously expected resulting from both the accelerated pace of merchant migration in international markets as well as some additional core pressure, which magnifies this result. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion. At the midpoint this represents growth of approximately 14% of spot and includes about 8.5 points drag from eBay or approximately $465 million negative impact. On a two-year basis, inclusive of this drag, our guidance represents 19% growth. We also expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be flat to last year or approximately $1.07 reflecting increased investments to support our growth initiatives and the pressure, we're facing from eBay. Our financial performance over the first half of 2021 has been very strong and consistent with the guidance we've outlined at the outset of each quarter. At the same time the environment in which we're operating while more stable than a year ago continues to be very dynamic and more challenging to predict than normal. Adding to the complexity is this exercise a predicting eBay's transition for which we have less than perfect visibility. Each quarter we try to provide our best estimate of the level of performance that we believe we can deliver. Overall, our growth remains strong, and importantly we continue to see the categories that benefited from quarantine measures and shelter in place activities last year maintain higher levels of e-commerce volumes in comparison to pre-COVID levels. Our conviction in our ability to drive sustainably strong performance, and in the strength of our franchise has never been greater. This year we expect to process approximately $1.25 trillion of payments volume. We expect to grow revenue by 20% more than offsetting pressure to revenue growth of approximately 7 points from eBay and lapping our strongest year with 22% revenue growth. And given the momentum we have in development and innovation and the pace of scale of the new experiences, we're bringing to our customers we are investing in our business at record levels. Further, last year we grew earnings 31%. On top of that performance this year, we plan to grow our earnings by 21%. Importantly, our team has never been more focused or aligned around the shared goal of being the leading digital payments company in the world. Last year was a pivotal moment in our history and this year we're building on that foundation and continuing to realize our ambition for greater relevance, ubiquity and impact as a global payments leader. We look forward to sharing more of our progress with you. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you. Thanks so much and thanks for all the details in the slides here. Good, good. Just with the third quarter guidance being a little bit lighter than trend, but you're also reaffirming the year even with eBay expected to be 1 point worse. Can you just reconcile that thinking between the third quarter and holding the year and then also if you could just help us bridge third quarter to fourth quarter growth for us, given all the moving pieces here, that would be great. Thanks. John Rainey : Sure. Tien-Tsin, I'll start there. Look, third quarter has always been -- was going to be our toughest quarter from a year-over-year growth rate perspective for a lot of the reasons I outlined. There are a number of reasons that are contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter. But I think before I get into them, it's important to understand that if you look on a year-over-two-year basis, the revenue growth actually is very consistent in each quarter of this year. And for the full year, we will be growing in the neighborhood of 20%. But of the items that are contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter, there is a few that I think are notable to call out. One is, there's certainly less pressure from eBay. That abates somewhat in the fourth quarter. We also have some benefit from the pricing changes that we announced that go into effect next month. And then we have a number of different initiatives that we're rolling out in the second half of the year in which we get most of the benefit or the full quarter's worth of benefit in the fourth quarter. And so all of those things tend to drive. I think some acceleration in what we're seeing in revenue from the third quarter to fourth quarter. And then as usual, we always have some seasonality around the holiday shopping season which we again expect this year. Dan Schulman : Now if there's one thing I can add to John's comments is, Q3 is the height of eBay pressure. And then, as John mentioned, as we go into Q2 those headwinds that have been growing against us on eBay turnaround and become tailwinds. So we have something like 850 basis points of pressure in Q3, as John mentioned, that drops to 600 basis points of pressure as we go into Q4. So that's a natural lift of about 2.5 points of revenue growth. And as we go into 2022, that continues to help our results. And I think if you look beyond the eBay impact and looked at our adjusted results, you can see that the core business and the strength of our franchise has really never been performing better. I think John mentioned one thing that I think is worth highlighting that the elevated spend around online is continuing even as we see economies reopen. I mean, you can see that in our growth rates of our volumes, up 40%, 48% without eBay. But if you even look at things like our daily active users, our daily active users versus pre-pandemic levels are up 43%. They were up substantially last year and they continue to grow as we go into this year. And so I think we have a lot of strength in the core. Some of that's being matched by eBay, but eBay is all about timing. We always knew these revenues were moving away, it's just a matter of timing. And now we've got kind of what we think is the right case, a 100% in third quarter. And then from there on in, those pressures abate. Tien- Tsin Huang : Agreed. No, I think it\u2019s just better to rip of the band aid as you say. Dan Schulman : Absolutely. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you, both. Dan Schulman : That\u2019s part of the system exactly, right. Yes. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you, both. See you. Thanks. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Operator : Your next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi, Dan. Hi, John. I know you all -- you both provided a lot of information on eBay throughout your prepared remarks, but I did want to drill down further into sort of the overall effect of eBay on your results. If you can kind of speak to the ongoing impacts to the back half of the year and into next year, and then the flip side, obviously, you've mentioned the ex-eBay performance, the 32% growth and so on. Should one expect that to be coming out of that sort of growth rate to be sort of a more normal appearance of what you can do? John Rainey : Sure, I'll start Ashwin. I'm sure Dan will want to jump in. Look, I think there's a couple of metrics that really highlights the true performance of our business. But to start with, we've always known that 2021 was going to be the year where we have the most significant impact from eBay. And the fact that we're lapping what was tremendous growth last year, and still performing at the level that we are this year in the face of that impact from eBay is really just quite phenomenal. But I'll give you an example, I think really tells the picture here. So last year, in the second quarter, we grew revenue 22%. And in that number, there was a benefit of 5 percentage points of growth from eBay. So 22% revenue growth with 5 percentage points of benefit from eBay. This year in the second quarter, we grew revenue 19% and that number included 800 or 8 percentage points of headwind related to eBay's business. And so that really underscores the strength of the franchise and how well we're performing right now. And quite frankly, it's something that we're very excited about, because this sets us up for, I think, much cleaner performance going forward and an acceleration in some of our growth rates when eBay is a much slower growing and smaller part of our business going forward. Dan Schulman : And if I can maybe complement some of John's comments there, first of all, I do want to say this about eBay. Obviously, they remain a very close strategic partner for us. We still have about 60% share of checkout on eBay and obviously eBay merchants and consumers want and desire to use PayPal. If you think about, just to give perspective -- historic perspective, if you think about when we split from eBay, six years ago, eBay's revenues as a percent of our total were 26% of our total revenues. And we believe that they're going to end this year around 3% or so. And that their TPV is going to be under 3% as a percent of our overall volumes. And so this is, as I mentioned before, it's a timing issue. And frankly, the sooner eBay transitions, the better it is for our future revenue growth. I'd also say, just one other thing we are making a lot of progress with a lot of other marketplaces coming out of the eBay restrictions and we continue to see Alibaba continue to ramp. Really pleased to watch the growth rates there, and we are making a lot of progress with a lot of other marketplaces that we'll talk about as we get along further in the year. So this eBay transition is behind us. At the end of this quarter, the headwinds dissipate and we're glad to start to move forward. As John said, we'll really be able to see the strength of the franchise start to shine as a result of that. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Thank you for those comments. Dan Schulman : Yeah, you bet. Operator : Your next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Faucette : Good afternoon, and thanks for all the commentary, Dan and John. I'm sure, there'll be additional questions on the quarterly cadence and eBay, but I wanted to touch on or for you to touch on something you mentioned earlier, and that is growing in store acceptance and QR codes. We've heard some positive things from industry sources recently on growing usage there. I'm wondering if you can give a little color on what you're seeing from PayPal's perspective, and how your acceptance works with the partnership with Clover from Fiserv and what you've done to enable that for merchants and consumers. Dan Schulman : Yeah, I think I'll start on this one. And then maybe John can kick in. So first of all, clearly, pretty much every merchant, whether it's small, mid-size or large is envisioning a seamless omnichannel feature. And that's where physical and online kind of blur together that they now start to use that to digitally interact with their customers to basically tie in their loyalty programs, customize deals and offers to individual consumers. And that is moving well beyond just checkout. Before we were thinking QR codes and other forms of contactless payments were great because was both fast and maybe more healthy in a pandemic environment. But all of our conversations now go beyond checkout. People are looking to drive loyalty and looking to drive rewards and coupons, more flexibility how consumers like, order, track pay for their services, customize incentives. And so that's really the conversations that we're having and that's where we're getting a ton of traction. By the way, I do think that this seamless omnichannel effort by us is key to us doing everyday usage. And if I look at not just multiple millions of consumers that are using our QR codes, but what's happening is they also are spending 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform and that halo effect is a big deal as we look forward, especially as we look towards the Super App which maybe somebody will talk about later, but the more and more services we put together the more and more of that halo impact that occurs. And so we obviously are up to now 1.3 million merchants, every 20 second, a merchant's signing up for more QR codes with us. We have a lot of momentum with large enterprises right now. But the conversations have moved to how do we fully integrate their loyalty programs into our app. How do we drive customize deals for them? And so those are taking a little longer to go live to site. But they are much more integrated than we've ever seen before. And we're seeing with customers like CVS, once you start to integrate that together, once you start to get a deterioration, we saw CVS transactions go up a 151% month-over-month. And so we're really beginning to see some traction in the marketplace around all of these things. We're very excited about it. It's going to be a multi-year journey for us, but we know that both merchants and customers expect us to be fully omni. James Faucette : Thanks a lot. Dan Schulman : You bet, James. Oh, yeah, by the way, James. One other thing. You talked about Fiserv and Clover, forgot about that. So that is rolling out this quarter. We are a default funding instrument on Clover, the very close partnership that we have with Fiserv and looking forward to reporting more on that as quarters go on. James Faucette : Thanks for clarifying that, Dan. Dan Schulman : Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : All right. Hey, thanks guys. Look, it's great to hear that the Super App refresh is going well. If you could just give us a little more specifics on the timing of the rollout. And then what you're looking forward to meet in terms of engagement or impact on NNA levels? And I guess just quickly on NNA. Dan you mentioned earlier, you're still confident in the high end of the $52 million to $55 million range which -- that would require a bit of a step up from second quarter levels. So just any more color on the condition there. Dan Schulman : Yes, sure. I'll start right with that quickly. We always knew the second quarter was going to be the low point of the year because we did $21.3 million, or $23.4 million NNAs a year ago. And even though they are performing better than cohorts that we previously had historically, the churn is lower. It's still a ton of incremental churn versus traditional cohorts of on the second quarter. And we're clearly beginning to see that dissipate already this year as I look at NNAs coming in. And so I feel really good about that guidance right now. Q4 is always a high point of the year. And so you'll see it start to build from second quarter, up in to third quarter and then up again in to fourth quarter. Then maybe if I can just -- if that answers your question on NNA, I'll go quickly into the Super App. We made a really substantial milestone by being code complete on this first iteration of the Super App. We're slowly ramping. It's the first change we've done to the app, first change since I've been here that we've done to the app. And so we want to kind of measure what the engagement levels are and the uptake of it, but this is going to be something where this isn't a big bang theory that this app in and of itself, this version is the be-all and end all. It obviously is going to look across payments, basic financial services and shopping tools. You're going to see releases and enhanced functionality come out pretty much every single quarter. But early on, that's going to include things like high yield savings, enhanced Bill Pay which will do improve search and better UX, more billers, aggregators. We're going to do two day early access to direct deposit budgeting tools, something we haven't talked about, QA messaging. So if P2P you $10 for whatever you're doing and you want to message me right back without sending me a P2P you can go do that. And we think that's going to drive a lot of engagement on the platform. You don't have to leave the platform to message back and forth. Obviously, the UX is being redesigned with that rewards and shopping. We've got a whole giving hub around crowdsourcing, giving to charities and then obviously Buy Now, Pay Later will be fully integrated into it. And by the way, as we go into next year we're going to -- like last time I counted was like 25 new capabilities that we going to put into the Super App. And so I don't want to dismiss at all. What we've done right now, but it just continues to improve going forward. And the way that I'm looking at success with the Super App is, what kind of engagement levels do we get, fully expect engagement to move up. What's happening to our average revenue per active account? By the way, even with the new services we've recently launched our average revenue per active account at eBay went up 13% this past quarter and that's a really good sign along with the 11% improvement in TPA which was really a record in the last four years or so. And so we've got a lot going on. I think our engagement, average revenue per active user and then we'll look clearly at all the halo effect as well. But we're excited to be on the journey right now and be underway. And again, you just see it continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. Darrin Peller : Yeah, you bet. Operator : Your next question is from Colin Sebastian of Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Great, thanks, good afternoon. I want to follow up on the Pay Later initiatives. There's clearly you're gaining nice traction with the users. I wonder how much of that activity is incremental to volume if that's just a function of the higher conversion rate. And secondarily, we've heard from some merchants that return rates are little bit higher with Pay Later. So I'm just curious if that impacts merchant adoption at all. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yeah, sure. So look it was another terrific quarter, I mean just in every way for Buy Now, Pay Later. As I mentioned, we give 1.5 billion of TPV in the quarter alone, aside of $3.5 billion [ph]. But this is amazing piece of a -- stat on that $1.5 billion. That's up 50% from Q1, sequentially. So you can really see that even we had so much momentum in Q1, that momentum really accelerated in Q2. You've got a bunch more merchants using it now. 650,000 merchants, more and more of them are presenting it upstream on their product pages. That obviously gives us a disproportionate share of checkout when that occurs, and here you can tell by the 7 million customers, doing 20 million plus transactions and obviously our repeat rates are extremely high. There is a lot of satisfaction with the product. It's still something like 70% are repeating within six months and our halo effect is the same as it was last quarter. So 15% halo effect in TPV, still a substantial reduction in our TE cost, about a 16% reduction. We're still seeing 80% plus release funded through debit. And yeah, Australia we put in place just a couple of weeks ago and bam it's off to a really strong start right away. So -- and part of the reason Colin, that we're getting such strong results is because we have 400 million customers. And when we put something in, it happens at scale and we know those customers. So the approval rates are much higher, returns are lower because we know the customer. And so a lot of the other Buy Now, Pay Later players don't necessarily know the consumer, the way that we know the consumer in this. And so, we're pretty pleased. We've got a ton on our roadmap ahead in terms of expanding internationally, more and more functionality that we want to put on the product itself. John Rainey : Colin, I just had a couple of points there, I think are really encouraging as we look at the early progress there. One is that where we have upstream presentment, we see a double-digit click-through rate from consumers, which is quite encouraging. And particularly when you think about what Dan mentioned and scaling that across all of our customer base. But the other, and it's a very important one. And it actually ties back into Darren's previous question around revenue per user and engagement. But we see a 15% lift in overall TPV among those customers that are using Buy Now, Pay Later. So we're early stages here, but as we've repeatedly said, we think that we've got a value proposition that is frankly second to none, and quite encouraged by some of the early results that we're seeing. Colin Sebastian : Great, thanks guys. Dan Schulman : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks so much, Dan and John. Given the new PayPal pricing model on branded and unbranded products effective August 2, can you gauge for us the expected annualized impact on revenue and non-GAAP EPS from these changes. And then as part of that, could you just elaborate on your physical point of sale payment strategy given the size of the price cut on physical credit and debit card transactions is quite substantial?? John Rainey : Sure, I'll take the first part of the question, David. Look our pricing change included both price increases and price decreases. And it remains to be seen and sort of the volume changes that come from each of those. And so in the context of our $25 plus billion revenue base, I would say that for the year these are relatively immaterial on our results. But I think very importantly, this provides a lot more transparency and clarity to our customer base around how -- pricing and really trying to price to the value that we provide for these customers, and we've demonstrated time and again where that value comes from and just survey data on customers' willingness to buy when PayPal is presented at checkout that is exponentially greater than when it's not. So this is probably overdue. It's been the first time in 20 years that we've made a change to our base pricing like this. But certainly think it puts us more in line with the market and really prices to the value that we're creating for our customer base. Dan Schulman : Yeah, I think that is a pretty comprehensive response from John. I mean we obviously carefully review every one of our pricing changes, up or down. We do extensive market research before we do any change. And as John said, we look at where we have value and we price in accordance with that. Clearly on the branded side, we think we had a tremendous amount of value, things that John talked about, buyer and seller protection, Buy Now, Pay Later at no incremental cost for our protection, highest checkout conversion, et cetera. But we took down rates for basic full stack processing that also was reduced somewhat substantially from $2.9 plus $0.30 to $2.59 plus $0.49 and that is going to enable us to aggressively compete for all of the payment processing of the merchants that do business with us. And you've heard us say time and time again David, that we are going to move into the in-store space and we are going to move, so aggressively in there. We rolled out Settle [ph] in the U.S., is a really beautiful full package. It doesn't just include card reader but inventory management, sales reach out and allows a merchant to seamlessly load inventory in both their online and in store locations, then across multiple channels as well. So we're obviously going to be very aggressive on moving into in-store and it's always been part of our strategy. And by the way, if a small merchant does all of their business with us, they can actually see the overall cost come down. And we want to encourage them to do all of their business with us because we are trusted platform they do turn to us. And we price, we think the right way. We finally unbundled some of this branded and unbranded because that's how the market is playing and we know where we want to be aggressive, and we're going after that David Togut : Thanks so much, Dan and John Dan Schulman : Yeah, you bet, David. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ramsey El Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ramsey El Assal : Hi, Dan, John, thanks for taking my question this evening. Dan, I wanted to get your updated view on Crypto and Blockchain and see how you guys are planning and engaging with the ecosystem from a consumer product perspective, and I know you just mentioned new crypto capabilities in the new app, but also from like a balance sheet perspective and internal technology perspective, how will you kind of engage with the ecosystem in the quarters ahead. Dan Schulman : Well, we continue to be really pleased with the momentum we're seeing on crypto. And we're obviously adding incremental functionality into that whether we probably saw increased limits to 100,000 a week. We're right in the middle of some open banking integration, which will increase the ability to fully integrate into ACH and do faster payments. We're going to launch, hopefully, maybe even next month in the UK, open up trading there, we're working right now on transfers to third party wallets and we really want to make sure that we create a very seamless process for taxes and tax reporting and so, we're really looking at how do we integrate that into both the trading and the buy with crypto on our platform. But I will say this, all of that is interesting, but it is in the main course, in terms of what we are trying to do with our blockchain and digital currency business unit. We are clearly thinking about what the next generation of the financial system looks like how we can help shape that. We are working with regulatory agencies, central banks across the world. The number of countries that are looking at CBDC, Central Bank issued digital currencies is increasing rapidly. And you're like in 40 countries like six months a year ago, you almost up to 100 countries looking at it right now. And clearly there is an opportunity to think about a new infrastructure that can more efficiently, I believe that could be a lower cost to do transactions and also get money to people much faster than happens today. I mean, the other day I sent an EFT from one bank to another bank and that Bank told me we're taking three days to access that money in the EFT I sent. That's crazy. It needs to be instantaneous and there is a large desire by governments to really think how can you create a more efficient system using new technology to bring in more citizens more underbanked, underserved citizens into the financial system Because they disproportionately pay a higher take rate in those who are fully bank to our higher income levels. And there's a lot of connections between digital wallets and Central Bank issued digital currencies. Imagine not having to send out stimulus checks but sending those directly into digital wallet. We instantaneous receive it and you don't have to go in to check cashing location and exchange that and get charged for that exchange there's just so many benefits to that as well as just plain utility to payments. How can we use smart contracts more efficiently? How can we digitize assets and open those up to consumers that may not have had access to that before? There are some interesting defi [ph] applications as well. And so we are working really hard, and by the way, as you probably have seen we are trying to pick off the very best talent in the ecosystem to come work here at PayPal. We have a list of names and phone numbers and we are slowly but surely building a team that I think it's going to really shape the thought process around this and I'm really pleased with at least the early returns on that. Hopefully that helps you. Ramsey El Assal : It does, and very interesting. Thanks so much. Operator : And we have time for one last question from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks guys. Just wanted to ask a couple here on margin. And for starters, can you just reconcile for us the unchanged revenue and EPS guidance for the year with the lowered operating margin guidance and talk about how much of the guidance change on margin is from eBay versus perhaps elevated OpEx growth expectations? And then just as a quick follow on, give us a sense of how we should think about the margin potential of your business beyond this year as eBay conversion moves into the rear-view mirror. Thanks. John Rainey : Sure, Jason, I'll take this and it's great to speak with you. So starting with the first part on the change this year really two things to note, one that we talked about is eBay. eBay, we expect to have an $0.85 impact to our EPS this year. And the fact that we are performing and expect to perform for the back half of the year at this level and being able to whether that impact is I think really speaks to the strength of the overall business, but the second area and this sort of gets into the second part of your question as well, but we're also investing aggressively in our business. I would argue that there's never been a more important time in our business to invest right now, to invest for a future where we believe in the primacy of digital wallets, we believe in the permanent pull forward of e-commerce we believe in the ubiquity of digital payments and too, we want to help shape that outcome. We want to be a leader in that space. Now it happens that the structural nature of our business, our margins once they go up, and by the way they will, to be very clear about that. But at the same time, we don't want to be a prisoner to expanding operating margin one quarter to the next, because we want to be able to appropriately invest in our business to create the most shareholder value that we can over the long term, and become the company that we all believe that we can be. And so close out our margins will go up. We said this year that we expect to have flat, maybe some marginal improvement in our margins. But as we noted at our Investor Day earlier this year, our margins will go up over time, but we want to invest for growth and invest to be that leading digital company, payments company that we know we can be. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, thanks for the comment John Rainey : All right, thanks, Jason. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back to Dan Schulman for closing remarks. Dan Schulman : Thanks so much. Well, thanks everybody for those great questions. I want to thank everybody for your time. We hope that all of you and your families are staying healthy and I hope that you have a great summer as well, and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Take care and thanks again for your time.

Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Mel. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2021. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our Company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 and our outlook for 2022. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, November 8, 2021. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. Well, the big news today is that for the first time, we're teaming up with Amazon to enable customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout. Starting next year, customers will be able to make purchases on Amazon.com and the Amazon mobile shopping app using their Venmo accounts. This is, obviously, a very significant moment in our Venmo monetization efforts and marks the beginning of an exciting journey with Amazon, now that we're no longer constrained by the contractual obligations of the eBay operating agreement. The increasing scale and brand trust associated with our two-sided platform continues to set us apart from the rest of the market and enables us to expand our footprint with existing merchants and attract new partners.  And now to our results. Our overall Q3 results were generally in line with our expectations. Our Total Payment Volume grew 26% on a spot basis to $310 billion. This comes even as eBay's TPV declined by 45% in the quarter and is now approximately 3% of our overall TPV. Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by 31% on a spot basis with an annualized run rate of $1.2 trillion. Our active accounts were up 15% year-over-year, reaching 416 million. We added 13.3 million Net New Active accounts in the quarter, including another 1.2 million merchant accounts, bringing our total merchant count to 33 million, and we remain on track to deliver more than 52 million NNAs for the year. Importantly, our diverse suite of products and services drove double-digit growth in our transactions for active accounts up 10% to 44.2 times.  Revenues in the quarter grew to $6.182 billion, growing 13% on a spot basis. This was slightly below our expectations as back-to-school sales and travel were weaker than we expected. But even so, excluding eBay, our revenues grew by 25% in Q3. eBay now represents less than 4% of our total revenues, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11, even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives.  Our platform continues to drive substantial value for our merchants. PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet, with more than 75% of the top 1,500 largest global merchants utilizing PayPal at checkout, and on average, our PayPal checkout conversion is 34% higher than other checkout options. In addition to our Amazon news, we are very pleased to say that Walmart now presents PayPal as a checkout option for both their grocery and marketplace business, and GoFundMe added PayPal to their checkout flow with Venmo to follow in the coming months. Valero and Phillips 66 are adding our QR codes to their thousands of gas stations across the U.S., and United Airlines recently launched PayPal QR payments inflight. As checkout evolves from pay now to pay on your own terms, we've seen rapid adoption of our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities in the U.S., Germany, France, UK, and Australia. In Q4, we will expand Buy Now, Pay Later to Italy and Spain. Also in this quarter, we eliminated consumer late fees to ensure we deliver the very best value proposition to our consumers, while delivering on our mission to build an inclusive digital economy. Since our Buy Now, Pay Later launch, we have processed approximately $5.4 billion in TPV, with more than $2 billion of that TPV in Q3 alone. Approximately 950,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities, and more than 65,000 have positioned Buy Now, Pay Later upstream on their product pages, and over 9.5 million consumers have transacted more than 33 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later products. We will expand our global pay later portfolio in the first half of 2022 to include longer-term installment plans, allowing consumers to spread higher-price purchases over longer periods of time. This is already available in Germany, where we are seeing great initial success. We completed our acquisition of Paidy, a fast-growing, two-sided payments platform, and provider of Buy Now, Pay Later solutions in Japan. This will accelerate our momentum in Japan, a strategically important market and one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.  We are seeing very positive trends on our new PayPal App, which has now ramped to 100% globally. Consumers are engaging with the app and discovering the breadth of our new value proposition. Although it's still early, initial results show that the new app has driven a 25 times lift in consumers exploring our deals and offer [staff] (ph); a 15% increase in first-time users transacting with crypto, and it has also driven a 35% lift in our cash card enrollments, and the average revenue per account from digital wallet users is twice that of checkout only users. We expect to launch more features next year, including equity investing capabilities. It is quite exciting to see the initial positive reaction to our app, and we will continue to refine and expand its functionality to help consumers navigate an increasingly digital and connected lifestyle.  Venmo continues to achieve milestones and break records and is on track to deliver $900 million in revenue this year. With more than 80 million customers, and $240 billion in run rate TPV Venmo's scale is on par with PayPal's entire U.S. franchise in 2016. Venmo\u2019s customers are adopting more and more products, and we're seeing accelerating momentum with our new product introductions. Even with all this growth and these impressive accomplishments, we are just at the start of Venmo's commerce journey, and we could not be more pleased about joining forces with Amazon. We expect Venmo to be transaction margin positive this year, while still growing its P2P business at very healthy rates.  Back half of 2021 was always going to be the low point of our revenue growth this year, and we are appropriately cautious as we enter Q4 and as we think about 2022. We are seeing the impact of global supply chain shortages in our merchant base, consumer confidence is weakened with the absence of stimulus payments and with the economy reopening, more people may be likely to do their holiday shopping in store, as confidence in delivery logistics is depressed from last year, and of course, we still feel the impact of eBay\u2019s managed payments migration over the next few quarters, although at a lessening rate. Almost all of these issues are temporal, and consequently, we expect our revenues will accelerate throughout next year, and we remain confident in our medium-term guidance. I'd like to spend a few moments on the recent rumors that made their way through the news. We participate in a rapidly moving industry and it's quite clear that consumers and merchants prefer a more connected, digital lifestyle that encompasses financial services, shopping, payments, and commerce. Our market research and that of others, strongly supports the vision of a more connected economy, and PayPal clearly has the brand trust, regulatory relationships and scale to be a meaningful leader in the digital economy. Exploring all potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value is our responsibility. But obviously, only a select few deals will meet our very strict financial, strategic, and capital allocation criteria. We are fortunate to be a market leader in an environment with so many potential opportunities, and operate in an industry with a number of favorable tailwinds. We will continue to execute against our game plan and responsibly explore the options in our rapidly evolving ecosystem so that we remain the leader we are today in tomorrow's world. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, partners, and employees for helping us deliver a solid quarter. We're now reporting our results for the 7th quarter since the pandemic began, and it's remarkable to take a step back and reflect on everything that we've accomplished during this dynamic and unprecedented time. There's been a profound and enduring shift in global commerce and consumer behavior, which has significantly expanded our addressable opportunity. The powerful and accelerating secular tailwinds of increasing e-commerce penetration and cash displacement have helped to advance our leadership position in payments. To give you a better sense of the scale of growth we've experienced, it took 20 years for PayPal to reach $600 [billion] (ph) in annual payment volume, which occurred in 2019. Only 2 years later, we crossed $1.2 trillion. Relative to 2019, we've seen significant growth across our key performance indicators, including active accounts, engagement, TPV, revenue, EPS, and free cash flow. At the same time, we're operating in a complex environment. The macroeconomic landscape is currently characterized by varying rates of reopening activity globally and influenced by short-term supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures, and concerns related to consumer sentiment. These factors contribute to a backdrop that continues to make forecasting more challenging. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our diversified platform, our global reach, and the scalability of our business. Notably, we delivered these results against tough year-over-year comparisons and in the quarter where we faced the most acute pressure from eBay's payments transition.  For the quarter, we are reporting revenue of $6.2 billion representing growth of 13% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. eBay Marketplace's revenue declined 67% to $235 million and contributed less than 4% of total revenue, versus approximately 13% last year. Excluding eBay, revenue grew 25% year-over-year, and 26% on average for the last 2 years. This 2-year compound annual growth rate, is particularly notable. Throughout 2021, this growth rate has been consistently strong at 25% and 26% in the first and second quarters respectively. I would also like to provide some context for our performance relative to our expectations when we provided third quarter guidance in late July. First, travel volumes strengthened in June and July. This trend then reversed in August and September due to concerns related to the Delta Variant. Second, back-to-school spending was somewhat softer than we had expected. While our overall performance was well within our guidance, we saw moderation towards the tail end of the quarter and exited at a lower growth rate than we had predicted.  In the third quarter, transaction revenue grew 10% to $5.6 billion. This growth rate reflects the steep decline in eBay revenue in the quarter. Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 23%. Other value-added services revenue grew 50% to $575 million. This performance was driven by increased revenue from Synchrony, and accelerated recognition of loan servicing fees from the PPP program. In the third quarter, total take rates, was 1.99% consistent with the second quarter and a decline of 22 basis points from last year. The mix effect of eBay contributed to approximately 55% of this decline. The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 2.43% compared to 4% in Q3 last year. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in a lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees, as well as merchant mix and growth and bill payment volumes. The 25-basis point decline in transaction take rate was driven by these same factors. The third quarter was another strong quarter for volume-based expense performance. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 83 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point versus last year. Transaction losses improved 4 basis points and represented 9 basis points as the rate of TPV. This level of loss performance is consistent with last quarter, matching the lowest transaction loss rate in our history. In the quarter, loan origination activity increased and we ended Q3 with $3.7 billion in net receivables representing sequential growth of 13%, and 43% growth relative to last year. Growth in our short-term installment pay portfolio was the primary driver of this increase. Strong performance of our loan portfolio, more stability in macroeconomic trends, and the mix of shorter duration originations from our installment pay products, resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 11.6% from 14.9% at the end of the second quarter. The net effect of credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter, inclusive of originations and reserve releases, resulted in a benefit of $25 million, and year-to-date, we released $300 million in reserves.  Overall, volume based expenses grew 20% and represented 46% of revenue, resulting in a transaction margin of 54.2%. I'd now like to cover our non-transaction related operating expenses. These expenses increased 17%, representing 30% of revenue. In the third quarter, our rapid pace of innovation continued. We had an exciting cadence of product introductions, including our new digital wallet apps for both PayPal and Venmo, the launch of Crypto buy, hold, sell in the UK, our goods and services P2P experience in Venmo, and cash back to Crypto with the Venmo credit card. To support and advance our key initiatives, we continue to invest aggressively in technology and development, and sales and marketing, including increased spending on customer acquisition and engagement strategies. These expense buckets drove 70% of the increase in non transaction related operating expenses.  On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was essentially flat to last year and our operating margin was 23.8%, and on a 2-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income was 20%. For the quarter non-GAAP EPS grew 4% to $1.11. This includes an approximate $0.29 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces, transaction margin dollars. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20 billion. In addition, free cash flow grew 20% to $1.3 billion, representing 21% of revenue. I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2021, as well as our preliminary thoughts for 2022. For 2021, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $25.3 to $25.4 billion, an increase of approximately 18% from last year. This represents a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 19%, and excluding eBay, we now expect 2021 revenue to grow 28%. We expect our operating margin to be in line to last year, which was the highest in our history. This performance reflects our strategic investment spend throughout the year, as well as the negative transaction margin dynamics resulting from eBay, offset by the benefit from the release of reserves. We now expect non-GAAP EPS for the year to be approximately $4.60, a 19% increase on top of the 31% growth last year. In our 2-year basis, this is 25% growth. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $5.2 billion in free cash flow, representing $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue we earn. As a result of this update to our full-year guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion. This represents approximately 13% growth at the midpoint. We also expect a $1.12 in non-GAAP EPS, representing 4% growth.  While the impact from eBay's payments migration came in consistent with our expectations for the quarter, relative to the beginning of the year, the headwind increased significantly. Until recently, we believe we could absorb this additional pressure and still deliver on our prior guidance, and while we came within our revenue expectations for the third quarter, the contributors to our revenue growth were somewhat different than what we had expected going into the quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we also began to see growth rates coming a little lower than planned. We're off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, but growth rate still remains slightly below our prior expectations. In addition, retail supply chain and labor market concerns which may impact the important holiday season have led us to adopt a more cautious stance for the fourth quarter. That said, in recent days, we've seen improvement. At this point in time it's difficult to say definitively whether the stronger turns will persist throughout the quarter, or if this improvement is a pull-forward of consumer holiday activity. Relative to the guidance provided at the start of 2021, we now expect revenue to be about 0.5% lower for the year, despite much more pressure from eBay than we had initially expected. Adjusting for the additional pressure to revenue growth from eBay, our revised 2021 guidance is actually ahead of the outlook we provided at the start of the year. In providing quarterly and annual guidance since July of last year, our goal has been to responsibly balance transparency with reliability and certainty. At the same time, we've also tried to emphasize the complexity of forecasting in this environment. We are taking what we view to be a prudent step in adjusting our outlook. But let me be very clear, our key strategic initiatives are on track and performing very well. The initial response to our new digital wallet experiences has been very strong, and the implementation of our new headline pricing in the U.S. has been successful with no discernible impact to merchant activity. The underlying strength, diversification, and resilience of our business on an absolute level, and relative to pre-pandemic are unassailable and position us to remain on offense regardless of short-term headwinds. Our ability to sustainably deliver strong growth at our scale is indicative of the network effects of our business and our competitive positioning as a global leader in digital payments at the intersection of the powerful secular tailwinds of e-commerce penetration and cash displacement has never been stronger.  As it relates to our expectations for 2022, we'd like to share some of our initial thoughts and the assumptions we're making for internal planning purposes. We are currently in the midst of our budget resource, and investment planning process for next year. In addition, how we exit the year, as well as the status of some of the exogenous factors that Dan and I have already discussed, are also important inputs for the year ahead. On a preliminary basis for 2022, we expect revenue growth in the high teens. If we had to put a point on it today, we'd likely anchor it at about 18%. It's also important to appreciate our expected trajectory of revenue growth. Due to the cadence of eBay's payments migration, as well as the stimulus measures earlier this year, we expect the first quarter next year to have more difficult comps and be our lowest growth quarter. Our plans are for revenue growth to then accelerate through the year, and to exit 2022 at a revenue growth rate in line with or ahead of our medium-term guidance. Similar to 2021, we expect that our growth rates will exceed industry growth rates by a healthy margin.  Given the ongoing planning that we're still doing, we will guide EPS growth when we report Q4 results early next year. That said I'd like to provide some color on how we're thinking about it. We see significant investment opportunities across our key priorities. In the past few years we've accelerated our pace of product innovation to better serve our growing network of more than 400 million consumer and merchant accounts. We are investing to advance our product roadmap, increase our relevance for customers, and drive daily engagement, and to support these initiatives, we expect our non transaction-related expenses to grow in the high single digits in 2022 on a base that will grow 20% this year. It's also important to note 2 factors that will have an impact on our EPS growth next year. First, we will lap the benefit we realized from the release of the credit reserve this year, and second, we expect our effective tax rate to increase from the lapping of one time favorable tax adjustments. We expect these 2 items to result in an approximate 10-point headwind to non-GAAP earnings growth in 2022. That said, we remain very confident in the medium-term guidance we provided at our Investor Day earlier this year. We're witnessing the pull forward at e-commerce and displacement of cash continuing at an undiminished pace, even as reopening occurs, it's also true that the most difficult year in the transition away from eBay will be largely behind us as we move into 2022 and we expect our revenue and TPV growth rates to accelerate. We believe that investing in our business is more important than ever before, given the opportunities we see in front of us, and while we certainly expect our margins to increase over the long-term, we don't want to be so overly focused on that for one quarter, or one year to the next, that we don't invest appropriately. We're playing in this space to win. We are well-positioned to capture the immense opportunity ahead and see a clear path to achieving our financial and strategic objectives. Our powerful 2-sided platform focused on execution and mission-driven culture, backed by the tailwinds of digital commerce, set us up for success now, and in the years to come. Before I turn it back over to the Operator for Q&A, I would like to spend a moment discussing our approach to capital allocation. Our business is characterized by its very powerful cash flow generation. Since separation, we generated approximately $22 billion in free cash flow. We've returned nearly $10.5 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, and allocated approximately $13 billion in cash to acquisitions and investments. We remain committed to both a disciplined capital allocation and to balancing organic and inorganic growth investing to drive shareholder value creation. Inorganic opportunities are accelerant to our growth plans and to achieving our long-term aspirations. It's important to note that our medium-term outlook does not rely on acquisitions. At the same time, we will continue to be opportunistic in executing our strategic priorities, shaping the future of payments, and advancing our leadership position. With that, I will turn it back to the operator. Operator, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operators Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to ask one question only and you may return to the queue for a follow-up question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. First question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Real exciting to hear about the Amazon news. I noticed a lot to talk about here, but I wanted to ask on the market rumors on Pinterest if you don't mind and I know you are not pursuing a deal at this time, But just wanted to ask if your appetite to do a large deal is still there? If your longer-term outlook hinges on adding any assets like that with different revenue sources like advertising? I know, John, you said you're not counting on M&A for mid-term, just thinking a longer-term here. Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yeah. I'll start off with that and then John can chime in on this. Let me just take one step back, and start a little bit with the big picture because that may help put everything into context. Look, we're obviously focused on becoming an essential everyday app for consumers, and that's on the consumer side, and on the merchant side, we want to provide a comprehensive platform for merchants to participate in the digital economy, and that includes everything from consumers engaging at the beginning of their shopping journey to purchase and post-purchase, and if you look at all of the acquisitions that we've done over the past 5 years, they kind of play into that overall strategy, whether it be what we've done internally with the PayPal App or QR codes, acquisitions like Honey, which have been essential to our shopping and deals tab fully integrated now into the PayPal App. Happy Returns, Chargehound that are part of our post-purchase process that we'll integrate into our app and put into our platform for merchants, iZettle Hyperwallet now is our payouts product going forward. So I\u2019m very pleased with all the acquisitions we\u2019ve done, they fit into our strategy, they're executing, many of them well above what we initially thought, some were delayed in terms of their integration for various reasons, but overall, really and pleased with the way our acquisition and acquisition strategy has gone and the integration into our strategy.  The truth is we review hundreds of potential acquisitions every single year and we put every single one of them through a very strict set of strategic financial integration filters and we look at like are we going to buy, build or partner, and, you know, John and I have been here now for - well, I've been here a little over 7 years, [Indiscernible] closing in on that \u2013 and we have never done a large acquisition so far, and the reason for that, and by the way, we look at a couple of those every year. There's very few that we look at, but we look at a couple every year and they have a much higher hurdle rate than our smaller acquisitions. I mean, we want to look, is it going to be a distraction? How tough is the integration? We fully understand what it means to do a large acquisition versus a small acquisition and in seven years we haven't done a single large acquisition because they haven't met any of our hurdles. I'm not saying that we might never ever do that, but - so it's not a likely event as we look forward. And our M&A philosophy, it remains the same. We're going to focus on high-quality assets that will accelerate our growth in areas that are more efficient than us doing it inorganically, and to your question specifically, we don't need to do something large to or small, frankly, to deliver on our medium-term guidance. All of our acquisitions are supplemental to our medium-term guidance, and clearly, we're going to be acquisitive going forward. I mean, we've got incredibly strong balance sheet, $20 billion cash and cash-like investments on it. We're generating between $5 billion and $6 billion a year of free cash flow. But we are going to maintain the same strict and disciplined manner that we look at acquisitions that have lifted acquisitions over the last couple of years. John, anything that you can add? John Rainey : I think you covered a lot of it, Dan. I just would add, Tien-Tsin, that we laid out what we believe to be a very compelling case at our Investor Day around value-creation over the next 5 years. That was entirely an organic plan and remain so. But that said, we don't want to sit here on our hands and think that that's good enough. If there are opportunities that are out there that create even more value creation, it's our responsibility to look at those, and so that's where deals of this size may come in sometimes, but we take capital allocation as a very serious activity for us, and then arguably one of the most important, and so as they have said we have a lot of rigor around that, and thus far nothing has matched those rigorous hurdles for us. But I think and the management team shares a belief that we have the same opportunity over the next 5 years to create value that we just realized over the last 5 years. But if we can do more than that, then we should do more than that, and so that's why we explore every opportunity, but the growth plans that we laid out in the early part of this year at our Investor Day are entirely organic. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is now open. You may ask the question. Colin Sebastian : Good afternoon everybody. So pretty big news here with Amazon on the Venmo integration, especially given how protective Amazon is over their checkout flow, so congrats there and it might be helpful to expand a bit on what you talked about Dan around the agreement such as are the economics with Amazon similar to other marketplace deals that you have in place, are there opportunities to expand the relationships to other PayPal brands and services and maybe when in 2022 we can expect that to show up on the site. Thanks very much. Dan Schulman : You bet, thanks, Colin. Good question. First of all, I'd say one of the things we talked about early on is being free of the restrictions of the eBay operating agreement. We're going to have the possibility to open us up to working with a number of marketplaces that we were previously prohibited from doing so, and you're seeing some of that. You are seeing what we're doing with Ali and AliExpress, that continues to expand in terms of the volumes. There we are getting closer and closer with Walmart and Amazon is the latest example of us being able to team up with obviously an extremely significant player in the e-commerce space, and what I really like about this is like eBay results are like a pig to the Python right now. But these that we're talking about, right, are much more of a permanent nature. These are what will be with us going forward as eBay is a temporal phenomenon working through our results. We're still working through the launch timeframes. We are both eager to get this out into the marketplace, but we're still working those two, we obviously have large teams, each of us on this. It is the beginning of a journey of our two companies teaming together. I wouldn't venture at this moment as to where we'll go together; we're both very focused on the substantial opportunity that there is with Venmo at checkout, and we couldn't be more pleased to be able to team with Amazon on this. Obviously, if you think about the amount of market share that Amazon has in the U.S. this quite substantially increases the addressable market for Pay with Venmo. And Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward. Just as I think about the journey that Venmo has been on, this obviously is a punctuation point for sure. But even this year, Venmo will be transaction margin positive. That is a major milestone for that team, right on track to deliver the $900 million and obviously, exit the year at an accelerating growth rate and this partnership with Amazon will no doubt take that to next level. John Rainey : Colin, I'll just add real quickly that Dan and I both appreciate that the investor community probably is getting tired of us talking about eBay and eBay results, but arguably not more so than we are, but this is the other side of that coin. It's as simple as that. I mean this would not be allowed had we not taken the steps that we had, and so we're quite excited about this and what it bodes for the future. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Thanks. Good afternoon. I'm going to focus on the roll out of the new PayPal and Venmo apps. I know you made some comments in the prepared remarks, but can you elaborate a bit further, give a little more color on the early impact you're seeing maybe on user growth, engagement growth, etc., including maybe some aspects so far that have surprised you? Thank you. Dan Schulman : Yes. Thanks, Lisa, good to hear your voice. So anytime you put something substantial out into the market, and this is really the first giant revamp that we've done of our PayPal consumer app and it's pretty massive, complete redesign. Typically on that, so what you find is you've got declines in engagement as people kind of like work their way through discovery of it, and then what you have is, over time, that really starts to accelerate, as we said you know. This has been completely the opposite which is the biggest delight, I'm not sure it's a surprise to me, but we are seeing, really, meaningful leaps in terms of our discoverability of the breadth of our products and service line right now. We talk about PayPal shopping, the full integration of Honey into the PayPal App, Honey now is completely mobile, and not just desktop, and that is empowering a whole tab of that. We've seen a 25 times lift in people exploring that tab and starting to put deals into their wallets and that kind of thing. It\u2019s pretty amazing.  On things like crypto, first-time user, once we did the app went up by 15%. Our strongest week ever for first-time users was like last week. We\u2019ve had strong weeks for first time users of growth on that, but clearly the new app is driving both discoverability and conversion on the crypto side. And then I'm quite excited about what's happening with cash card. Because cash card is kind of like a debit card, right? In relation to the balance, and it can be used offline and obviously online, and this is a big part of our omni strategic thrust, and to see that go up, there's enrollment score up by 35%, and remember, this is really early days, we fully ramped in the middle of October, globally. So this is early on and I usually think of early on as, okay, how do we start to claw back to where we were and then start to move forward as customers get it. This was a leap forward. Look, there are a lot of things that we're going to do to improve the customer experience. We're putting FIS now into our bill payment, expanding our bill payment quite dramatically, expanding the usability and kind of the simplicity of it , but each and every one of the products and services we are looking at the feedback we're getting and just making small little changes to keep increasing. This is going to be, I didn't think it was going to be a big bang, it actually just turned out to be a relatively big bang on introduction. But I really think of this as evolutionary quarter-by-quarter-by quarter. We will launch high-yield savings in the next several months that will begin to ramp, will start to put on things like equity investing, we anticipate doing that next year and there\u2019ll be more and more products and services to help customers engage more and more, and that's why like that ARPA, wallet users versus checkout only, again early, but to see that already leaping up to 2 times that of checkout only. that\u2019s why John and I are quite excited about the impact of the initiatives that we're putting into place, and they are clearly going to drive a lot of growth for us as we look forward. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI David Togut : Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the third quarter KPIs, they\u2019re certainly strong and broadly in line with your 5-year guide, and then you called out some short-term factors and tough comparisons for taking guidance down for the fourth quarter and guiding 2022, at least, your preliminary guide below the 5-year model. But when you look at 2022, at some of the shorter-term factors, you've called out like supply chain issues and return of consumers more to the physical POS, how confident are you that some of these issues are actually shorter term versus potentially longer lasting that might stretch into 2023? Dan Schulman : Okay. David, let me talk very quickly about Q3 and then I'm going to have John talk about our Q4 guidance and our confidence in 2022. So you're right, actually, if you look at Q3, and let me just talk about revenue, TPV, and maybe engagement, as 3 metrics on that. The way that I think about our business right now is what's happening on our MS business. Because eBay is a temporal thing, it's just going through the system right now. It's less than 3% of our TPV, it\u2019s less than 4% of our revenues, and dropped, and so really our business is our MS Business going forward. And if I look at revenue, revenue growth. I think this is really interesting because I examined this quite carefully. If I go back 5 years and look at our MS revenue growth, in Q3 of 2017, it was 24%. In 2018 in Q3, it was 17%; 2019 was 23% then it jumps up to 26% in the middle of the pandemic, Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, this quarter it is 25%, and so like people talk about reopening stuff, like that is enough. Our MS business is going from strength to strength. We have seen a leap forward in digital, and that is continuing, if you look at it in our MS and John will talk about it in Q4, and as we look next year. Same thing on TPV. TPV in Q3 of 2018. MS, I'm talking about MS, was 27%, it jumped up to 29%. Then in Q3, 2020 it jumped to 40% and over that 40%, we're growing this quarter at 31%, and so these are all really, really strong numbers, and if I look at even like transactions, which I think it's really interesting, we did 4.9 billion transactions in Q3 this last quarter. If you go back a year ago, we did about 4 billion, we're almost up a billion transactions in a year in the quarter, and our transactions ex-eBay are up 31% year-over-year. Our TPA transactions were active, double-digit growth for the second quarter in a row. Again, ex-eBay in the third quarter, our TPA was up 18%, and so these are, yes, of course, we get hit by some of these exogenous things that go on. But if I look at the strength of the core business every single metric is way above, even our forecast is way above our medium-term guidance, and that's kind of like what gives us just a ton of confidence, and we are obviously being, I think appropriately cautious and conservative as we look forward at this time, but I feel like if I look at the what the real part of our business is every metric is trending pretty strongly right now. John Rainey : David, let me hit a couple of points here regarding some of the assumptions about our outlook. So first, with respect to the reopening of the economy, our basic assumption is that that's sort of a slow and steady pace similar to what we've seen here more recently. With respect to supply chain or labor shortages, I don't see a quick fix to that, so that could be with us for some period of time and I think the pressure there's probably more acute on some of the SMB segment versus large enterprises, and so that is baked into our assumptions as well. We\u2019re also not going to have the benefit of stimulus next year or likely not based upon what we see today, and then the last point I'd make is around eBay. eBay, if you think about the high teens or 18%-mark that we put out there for revenue growth, the impact to eBay year-over-year in terms of a headwind is about 200 basis points. If you just take what eBay represents in our business in 2021 compared to 2022. Said differently though, if we were to exclude eBay in both years, the revenue growth is 22%, and so that's exceedingly strong, and I think the best proxy for how to think about our business going forward, and so wrapping all of that together and sort of tying it to where we stand right now with the guidance that we just gave today. If you go back to the beginning of the year, and the guidance that we provided, 50 million Net New Actives, roughly $25.5 billion of revenue, we're effectively right there, and I think very, very importantly, that was the basis for the 5-year plan, the medium-term guidance that we laid out just a few weeks after that, and so that's a way of saying that we are right on track with what we have laid out at the beginning of the year with our medium term guidance. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to touch on the organic trends of the business, mainly the KPI Net New Actives and just maybe if you can give a little more color on the organic dynamics you are seeing now, a year and a half into COVID, in terms of gross adds versus mature levels, and we're also getting more questions on '22 guidance and some of the inputs there that you just touched on that, John, so thanks, but thinking about the underlying, sort of user growth potential there, engagement potential, and then really just reminding us of your conviction in the drivers getting to 750 million of NNA long-term? Thanks, guys. Dan Schulman : Sure, so let me talk a little bit about NNAs. So $13.3 million in the quarter up about $2 million from last quarter, growing 15% year-over-year unlike a lot of companies that experienced growth during the COVID time, and then unwinding our growth remains incredibly strong on the NNA side. I mean, think about it, in the minute that we have been talking, so far Derrin, we put on about 100 consumers and 9 new merchants. We're putting on 1.5 consumers every second of the quarter, every 6 seconds we've put on another merchant, so really unbelievable. And if I look 5 years ago, you remember this, 5 years ago we put on 13 million Net New Actives for the year we just had this quarter alone we've put on a 110 million Net New Active since January of 2020, and as we said, I think in our press release we expect to end the year in north of 430 million actives on the platform. So you know obviously continued strong growth, but as you look forward to that 750 million, there are 2 places that our Net New Actives come from. One is top of the funnel, and top of the funnel is actually pretty strong right now and remain so. It's just kind of a must have platform for merchants and consumers and scale begets scale in this business. But as you get bigger and bigger, the bottom of the funnel becomes equally, if not even more, important, and so reduction in churn becomes a really important element of our ability to get to the $750 million. That's why we're so excited about what we're seeing in terms of our TPA numbers again normalize it, ex-eBay up 18%. Last quarter, I think it was up 17% double-digit growth even with eBay and 2 quarters in a row, some of the things I was talking to Lisa about in terms of the engagement on the app, those are things that the more people engage, the more people get cash cards and start utilizing that service offline, we see halo effects inside the business, Buy Now, Pay Later all of that that actually effects churn rate, and if we can keep a consistent top of the funnel, maybe even improve that a little bit, but reduce our churn rate, you'll start to see Net New Actives actually accelerate going forward and so we remain so quite confident in the 750, but that's what the drivers are of that Derrin. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much and thanks for all the color and detail of things that you're going through. John, I know you kind of touched around this in your commentary, but if we think about all the irons and initiatives that you have in the fire right now, how should we think about kind of the medium-term progression of your operating margins? I know you also highlighted that you want to make investments, but just trying to make sure that we try to align our own expectations with how you're thinking about your planning purposes going forward. Thanks. John Rainey : So I'll start by saying that, I would hope that people appreciate and agree with this, but I don't think there's ever been a more important time to invest in our business than right now. This is a precious opportunity that we have with some of the secular tailwinds. We're fortunate in that the margins on our business want to go up. We've demonstrated that we can scale at a very low marginal cost, we've got tremendous opportunities some of which we've talked about today, that give us confidence that over our planning horizon, our margins will go up. That's not something that I think we lose a ton of sleep about. Quite frankly, I think the more challenging dynamic is where to invest, where we can get that return that's expected, and if you think about the last couple of years being 2020 and this year 2021, our operating expenses have grown about 20% each of those years, and I would discourage you from thinking about that as a sort of one-time spend related to customer acquisition or something like that. There's a lot of like engineering costs around people that are punching the keyboard to write code, and that's still with us today. So even as we talked about the high single-digit growth next year, that's on top of 2 years of 20% growth. But for us it\u2019s also important not to spread ourselves too thin and to make sure that we are prioritizing appropriately and some prioritizing involves, say notice our things as well. And so I think we've laid out a pretty clear plan over the next few years with our focus on things like the digital wallet, building out commerce capabilities, continue to monetize Venmo that give us ample opportunity to invest. But as I noted in my remarks, we don't manage the business to have margin expansion for the next quarter, or frankly even for the next year. We're looking at how we create a Company over the next 5 years, that can have the same type of market value appreciation that we've experienced over the last 5 and the decisions that we make really just lineup with that much more so that trying to maximize for any particular time period. And so maybe not directly answering your question, but our margins are going to go up over the long term and we're not going to be handcuffed to doing that from one period to the next at the expense of like creating shareholder value. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one last question, comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, guys. Hey, how are you? I guess, they're now tracking to more of the lower end of the 52 to 55 million target for the year previously thought to be closer to the higher end. So I'm just wondering, is this some incremental softness in gross adds, is it higher churn, a decline in new activations? It seems like we may be down a little bit quarter-over-quarter in Q4 but normally there is some positive seasonality. So just wanted to get your take on what\u2019s going with the NNA? Thanks. Dan Schulman : Yeah, great question Jason. Thank you for that. If you remember we started the year at 50 million then we raised it 52 to 55 and then we thought we'd be towards the higher end of the 52 to 55. At this point, we're just being consistent with our revenue guide as well. We're going into the heart of the holiday, you're exactly right. If holiday season shapes up like it did last year, then we'll have more than 52 million organic because there would be a lot more of shopping, and if it doesn't, then we'll have a little bit less. So it's very consistent with us just being, I think prudent and cautious given some of the trends that we're seeing and others are talking about. Again, supply chain shortages, people can\u2019t shop if consumer confidence is down, people do more in store, we\u2019ll get less M&As than we typically might, . If the holiday season goes as it did last year, we'll get more than we are talking about right now. So I just think it's just very consistent with the guide that we gave, and again, as John mentioned, we had a good start to the quarter, we\u2019ve had a pretty strong last week report too, but we're early on right now and so we don't like it when we are at the mid-point of our guidance or any of that kind of thing. We are used to being a Company that puts out things and then beach what it puts out, and we want to assure that what we say is appropriate and an appropriately conservative on it. So that's how I think I would answer that question, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Dan Schulman : All right. Operator, thank you, Jason for that last question, really look forward to talking to all of you over the course of the next couple of days and weeks and at a number of different conferences, and thank you for all your support and your time today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings\u2019 Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter 2021. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Donna. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal\u2019s earnings conference call for the fourth quarter of 2021. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company\u2019s performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022 and our medium-term outlook. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, February 1, 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle and thanks, everyone for joining us. Today, I am going to highlight our 2021 results, but I also want to spend time discussing the opportunities and challenges we face this year. 2021 was one of the strongest years in PayPal\u2019s history. Our revenues grew by 18% to $25.4 billion and our non-GAAP EPS grew 19% to $4.60. We surpassed $1 trillion in annual TPV for the first time in our history, ending the year with $1.25 trillion of total payment volume. We had a record 5.3 billion transactions in Q4 alone, up 21%. We added 49 million net new active accounts to exit the year with 426 million active accounts, including 34 million merchants. In the last 2 years, we added 122 million net new active accounts. And despite that spike in new users, our transactions per active account grew to 45 this past year, an 11% increase. And last but not least, we generated $5.4 billion in annual free cash flow. With all that said, 2021 was also a difficult year. It was a particularly hard year to forecast. eBay\u2019s migration to managed payments happened faster than we anticipated. Overall, eBay put $1.4 billion of pressure on our top line, reducing our revenue growth by 700 basis points. Ex-eBay, our revenue growth was very strong, growing 29% on a spot basis for the full year and 22% in Q4. Exogenous factors also did impact our results. Supply chain issues disproportionately impacted our cross-border volumes and our small business merchants. Inflationary pressures impacted spending within certain segments of our user base. Rising threats from COVID variants cut travel and event bookings and the elimination of government stimulus had an impact as well. E-commerce growth rates during the holiday season were lower than industry expectations despite a strong 2-year growth rate of almost 50%. And we are also lapping some of the strongest quarters of growth in our history. Even so, we once again grew our market share and came within our revenue guidance for the quarter. 2022 is going to be a year of transformation and investment as we transition from outsized growth, driven by lockdowns during the pandemic and finalize the lapping of eBay\u2019s managed payments transition. EBay\u2019s transition will put an incremental $600 million of pressure on our top line, approximately $400 million in Q1 and $200 million in Q2. In the second half of the year, I look forward to being able to stop adjusting for eBay and letting the strength of our core results speak for themselves. Our growth ex-eBay has consistently been above 20%. And our year-over-two-year growth rates have been remarkably stable, again demonstrating the underlying strength of our platform. As I take a step back to reflect, it\u2019s clear we are in a significantly stronger position than when we entered the pandemic, with the world continuing to digitize the use of cash dissipating and the move towards omni-channel commerce accelerating. Our vision of becoming an essential consumer financial super app across payments, basic financial services and shopping tools is more relevant than ever before. And our tens of millions of merchants continue to look to us to provide a comprehensive platform for them to navigate the digital economy, where the lines between virtual and physical commerce are disappearing. The past 2 years have revealed new insights about our customers. We have seen their behaviors and expectations evolve throughout the pandemic with corresponding impacts on the key drivers of our business model. Consequently, as John will discuss in more detail, we are shifting our emphasis more towards engagement and towards driving higher value NNAs. Consumers who are more engaged drive incremental sales for our merchants and they drive growth at much higher margins and ROI. Over time, we obviously still expect to grow our net new actives, but more in line with our pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we fully expect engagement will increase above our current trend lines, while we accelerate revenue and EPS growth throughout the year. Our forecast for 2022 is appropriately measured given the difficult comps in the first half and an unpredictable macroeconomic environment. We are going to focus our energy on what we can control, including key product and go-to-market initiatives that will enable us to capture the numerous opportunities that are inherent in the secular shift to digital. At the same time, we will drive increased operating leverage in order to enter 2023, with revenues and non-GAAP EPS growing at over 20%. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong and our team is executing to win. Last year, we launched more products and experience for our customers than any other year in our history. We integrated Honey into the new PayPal app to help consumers shop and discover deals and new brands. We expanded our checkout capabilities to help consumers pay on their own terms, whether in-store with QR codes, over time with Buy Now Pay Later, or with the emerging funding sources like cryptocurrencies or reward points. And we acquired Happy Returns to anchor our post purchase process and make returns easier and more affordable. We expect these investments will continue to drive increasing engagement. We are intently focused on taking our best-in-class checkout experiences to even greater heights. Through our investments, we are making it faster and easier to checkout with some of the highest authorization rates in our history. Today, more than 70% of the top North American and European retailers, including more than 80% of the top U.S. retailers accept PayPal or Venmo at checkout. We continue to grow our market leadership in branded payments with our average share of checkout among top merchants continuing to increase. Last quarter, we signed new or expanded agreements with Instacart, Gap Inc., DoorDash, Adobe, Oracle and salesforce. Buy Now, Pay Later is a perfect example of the type of investment we are making to give shoppers and retailers more reasons to engage with PayPal. Buy Now, Pay Later is available in 8 markets, including with Paidy in Japan. We continue to see rapid consumer adoption, with $3.2 billion of Buy Now, Pay Later TPV in Q4 alone, a $13 billion run-rate, with Q4 growth of over 325% year-over-year. We have processed 54 million loans globally since launch, with 13 million unique consumers and 1.2 million merchants using our Buy Now, Pay Later services. Venmo had a solid finish to the year and closed out 2021, with more than $0.25 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, up 80% year-over-year. We are still at the beginning of our monetization journey, with Amazon implementing the option to pay with Venmo later this year. And Venmo is turning an important corner and in Q4 helped to drive the sequential increase in our overall take rate. As always, we have got a lot of work ahead of us. We are fortunate that we have so many assets to leverage in the future that is clearly moving in our direction. We have a two-sided network at scale. We are one of the most trusted brands in the world. We have tremendous financial strength, with a strong balance sheet and we anticipate generating approximately $6 billion of free cash flow in 2022. We have a seasoned and experienced team with strong relationships, with customers, regulators and policymakers around the world. I want to thank the PayPal team for all they do, for staying focused, innovating its scale, delivering more product than ever before, with record platform stability and availability in a time, where our payment volumes have nearly doubled over the past 2 years. I am excited about building on the underlying momentum of our core business and I know our team feels that same sense of purpose and optimism. And with that, let me turn the call over to John. John Rainey : Thanks, Dan. I\u2019d like to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding year following our record-breaking performance in 2020. There are several important points that I want to discuss today. I am going to discuss a pivot in our strategy to focus more on engagement and what that means for our net new actives going forward. I also want to discuss why we are taking a more conservative outlook for 2022 for both revenue and earnings. And lastly, that we don\u2019t believe either of these items will prevent us from achieving the revenue and earnings growth rates, along with our free cash flow objectives in the out years of the period contemplated in our medium-term guidance. But first, I want to spend a moment discussing our Q4 performance. 2021 certainly had its ups and downs, but when one steps back and looks at our overall performance, it was really an amazing year. TPV grew 33%. Revenue grew 18%. And we generated $5.4 billion in free cash flow. We also added 49 million customer accounts, ending the year with 426 million. And our engagement metric, transactions per active account, grew 11%, an acceleration of approximately 10 percentage points from 2020. Remarkably, in 2021, growth on our platform, excluding eBay, accelerated meaningfully on top of extraordinary performance in 2020. TPV growth accelerated more than 500 basis points to 38% and revenue growth accelerated more than 600 basis points to 29%. Since 2019, our volumes ex-eBay, have nearly doubled. And overall, we have consistently grown volumes well ahead of industry growth rates. We also advanced our leadership position in checkout. Since the start of the pandemic, on average, our share of checkout among the largest publicly traded merchants has increased by nearly 200 basis points. Further, in the U.S., consumer adoption of our digital wallets is several times higher than the next nearest wallet. And our merchant acceptance leads all other checkout buttons by an even more sizable margin. By any measure, we are a leader in digital payments. There are only a handful of companies that generate the amount of revenue and free cash flow growth that we do annually. And we are confident that our long-term market opportunity is greater than ever. In the fourth quarter, total payment volume grew 23% to $340 billion. eBay volumes in the quarter declined 45% and represented 2.7% of total volumes versus 6% last year. And excluding eBay, volumes grew 28% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue in the quarter increased 13% to $6.9 billion. Revenue ex-eBay grew 22%, which is 2 points ahead of our medium-term growth outlook. This strong performance was broad-based across Braintree, Venmo, core PayPal and our credit products. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2020, U.S. revenue grew 27% and international revenue decreased 1%. Supply chain shortages and eBay\u2019s transition adversely impacted cross-border volumes and foreign exchange fees. Ex-eBay, international revenue grew 11%. Importantly, on a currency neutral basis, the 2-year compounded growth rate for revenue in the quarter remained consistent with the fourth quarter of 2020 underscoring the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, total take rate was 2.04% and transaction take rate was 1.88%. Notably, both increased sequentially, reversing an approximately 2-year trend of sequential take rate declines. Both product mix and pricing benefited our performance. In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was strong. Transaction expense increased 3 basis points as a rate of TPV to 87 basis points driven by volume mix, particularly our growth in Braintree volumes and Q4 seasonality, which increases credit card mix relative to other funding instruments. Transaction losses improved 1 basis point to 9 basis points, which matches the best performance we\u2019ve reported in our history. Credit losses were 1 basis point as a rate of TPV versus 3 basis points last year, driven by our mix of originations, portfolio performance and $9 million in reserve releases. At the end of the quarter, our credit loss reserve coverage ratio was approximately 9%. In total, we released $312 million of reserves in 2021. Transaction margin dollars increased 6% to $3.6 billion and ex-eBay grew 18%. Transaction margin as a rate declined 365 basis points to 52.3%. And our non-transaction-related expenses grew 10% in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was flat in comparison to last year and operating margin declined 291 basis points to 21.8%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.11. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.3 billion. In addition, free cash flow increased 38% in the fourth quarter to $1.6 billion and we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock in the quarter. I\u2019d now like to discuss our net new accounts and provide more context for our performance and our expectations for 2022. For the quarter, our guidance contemplated generating about 12.9 million net new actives on an organic basis. We had a slower than expected finish to the year and came in below our target. There are three factors that contributed to this, which I will discuss in increasing order of magnitude. First, the more muted into the year for e-commerce growth, driven by both supply chain challenges as well as pullback in spending by lower income consumers affected consumer growth. Second, in the back half of the quarter, we also changed course on some of our customer acquisition strategies, including incentive-led campaigns. And lastly and most impactful to the quarter, there were certain accounts that we disqualified or excluded from our net new active number. For context, we regularly assess our active account base to ensure the accounts are legitimate. This is particularly important during incentive campaigns that can be targets for bad actors attempting to reap the benefit from these offers without ever having an intent to be a legitimate customer on our platform. In the fourth quarter, in connection with the increased use of incentive campaigns throughout 2021, we identified 4.5 million accounts that we believe were legitimately created. This number is immaterial to our overall base of 426 million customer accounts, but it affected our ability to achieve our guidance in the quarter. Now I want to shift to how we\u2019re thinking about net new active accounts in 2022, which is separate and apart from the factors impacting Q4. I\u2019m going to start with the headline here and then provide some explanation. We are evolving our customer acquisition and engagement strategy, and we now expect to add 15 million to 20 million net new customer accounts this year. In addition, we no longer believe that the 750 million medium-term account aspiration we set last year is appropriate. I\u2019ll explain. Over the past 2 years, we\u2019ve added more than 120 million customer accounts to our platform. This is, without question, remarkable growth and a complete step change from our trajectory prior to the pandemic. Our strategy for this has been twofold : continue to add net new actives and increase the engagement of our customer base. Last year, given the strong user growth, we pursued a strategy to retain those customers most likely to churn as well as attract many more new customers. We also leaned into incentivized customer acquisition tactics to a much greater extent than we ever have in our history. At the same time, we have continued to focus on and invest in areas that deepen our engagement with our customers, particularly as we continue to add new products and services. To assess the effectiveness of these strategies, we look at the impact on customer behavior in the months that follow account creation, in essence, looking at the ROI or return on that investment spend from their expected contribution to TPV, revenue and operating income. These programs are very successful in generating account creation. But overall, these customers have lower engagement and a higher propensity to churn and have not matched our required level of return. This dynamic compounds over time as it requires increasing investment, simply to keep minimally engaged users on our platform. Similar to a lot of businesses, we have a Pareto dynamic in ours where the vast majority of our volume comes from about third of our customer base. What this means is that unlike a subscription model where more users equates to more revenue in our business, that relationship is much, more attenuated. In assessing our marketing effectiveness, our engagement initiatives were considerably more successful than the incentive campaigns. We successfully moved customers up the engagement continuum into higher levels of engagement throughout the year. These strategies had strong returns and over time will be important contributors to achieving our long-term revenue per user objectives. Moving forward, we will continue to grow our users, but our focus will be on sustainable growth and driving engagement. To be very clear, this is a choice on our part. We could increase our spend and accelerate our net new active trajectory. However, we believe there are better ways to achieve our financial results. We strongly believe that we are making the right decisions in redirecting our spend toward high-value customer acquisition and engagement channels. That said, over the next 12 months as these less engaged customers naturally roll off, it will materially reduce our quarterly net adds. Over the next couple of quarters, we plan to supplement the disclosure of net new actives with the addition of monthly active unique user and ARPU metrics. These metrics have a more meaningful correlation with our financial results, and we believe this incremental disclosure will allow you to better assess engagement on our platform and the degree to which our strategies are working. I\u2019d now like to discuss our financial guidance for 2022 in the context of our fourth quarter performance and the initial outlook we provided in November. Overall, revenue performance for the quarter came in about how we had expected. October was a strong month, buoyed by some expected full pull forward in holiday shopping However, the back half of the quarter was weaker than we expected, consistent with the reported sequential decline in seasonally adjusted retail sales and consumer spending in December, we experienced a softer end to the quarter. The impact of Omicron and the effect of inflationary prices, combined with lack of stimulus is having an impact on spending, and by extension, our business. This impact is most pronounced on our lower income cohorts and has continued into the first quarter. The persistence of inflationary effects on personal consumption, labor shortages, supply chain issues and weaker consumer sentiment have led us to adopt a more cautious outlook. On last quarter\u2019s call, we preliminarily indicated high teens revenue growth for this year and said that if we had to pinpoint it, it would be around 18%. We have an incredible business, but we are not immune to the vagaries of the economy. Based on our more conservative stance today, we are starting the year with an expectation for revenue growth in the range of 15% to 17%. If these issues do not improve, it could cause us to be toward the lower end of that range. Should we see improvements relative to what we\u2019re seeing right now, it could result in being toward the upper end of that range. The environment continues to be difficult to predict, and this guidance provides our best estimate of the likely range of outcomes. In addition, as we discussed when we reported our third quarter results, our earnings growth in 2022 will be constrained by lapping the release of the credit reserves and a very low effective tax rate last year. In 2021, we released $312 million in credit reserves. This benefited operating margin by approximately 125 basis points and earnings per share by $0.21. Our effective tax rate was 10.5% last year, resulting from favorable discrete items, settlements and resolutions and benefited earnings per share by approximately $0.33 for the year. This is compared to an estimated tax rate of 16% to 18% this year. In the aggregate, these factors totaled $0.54 of EPS pressure year-over-year and represented the 12-point headwind to earnings growth this year. At the same time, continuing to invest in innovation in our go-to-market strategies is essential. Over the last 2 years, we\u2019ve invested nearly $1 billion over and above our historical spend in areas like engineering, technology, marketing and customer support, all of which have generated tremendous returns for us. This year, we\u2019re focused on leveraging these investments while continuing to innovate at scale strengthening our competitive positioning and advancing our leadership in digital payments. Importantly, we expect to deliver solid leverage in our non-transaction-related expenses in 2022, which will be offset by volume-based expense growth, predominantly related to our changes in our credit reserves. As a result, we expect operating margin to be in the range of 23% this year. And for the year, we expect to deliver $4.60 to $4.75 in non-GAAP earnings per share. In the first quarter, we\u2019re up against our hardest comps, as we grew revenue 31% and non-GAAP EPS 84% in Q1 last year. The first half of last year benefited from stimulus, stronger consumer confidence and a greater contribution from eBay. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 6% to $6.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.87, which represents about a 30% decline from last year. As we progress through the year, our revenue growth will accelerate. We plan to deliver at least 20% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and exit the year at a top line growth rate in line or ahead of our medium-term target. In addition, while the trajectory of the economy has been difficult to predict and may give rise to short-term deviations in our expected performance, over the long-term, nothing has changed as it relates to our confidence in our business and our expectations for performance beyond 2022. That said, when we laid out our medium-term outlook 1 year ago, underlying the assumptions was a more normalized steady-state expectation for overall economic activity and consumer demand. Our medium-term targets simply did not contemplate inflation at a 40-year high and supply chain issues not seen in my lifetime. As such, 2022 is now off to a slower start than we previously anticipated, and we are taking a more conservative stance on the year. We continue to believe that our revenue and earnings growth rates as well as our free cash flow objectives are achievable in the outyears of the period contemplated in our medium-term guidance. I want to close with these thoughts. We arguably just had one of the best years in our history when you examine our financial metrics. Eclipsing $25 billion in revenue and generating almost $5.5 billion in free cash flow. By virtually any measure, we are a market leader in digital payments and will continue to grow faster than the market. There are very few companies of our size with our global reach with our growth rates and cash generation. But we\u2019re in a dynamic industry and one that is constantly evolving, even more so because of COVID. And we are evolving with it. Notably, our strategy as it pertains to engagement and net new actives. And even with the broad diversity of our business, we are not completely insulated from macroeconomic factors that while maybe impacting short-term performance have nothing to do with a long-term intrinsic value of our business. We\u2019re going to continue to innovate, to grow, to increase our relevance to customers and focus on the things that we can control to continue to create value and be a global leader in digital payments. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator, we can... Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to drill in on the NNAs again, if you don\u2019t mind. Just what drove the decision here to focus on engagement focusing on quality instead of growth in NNAs? Just trying to gauge your confidence and expanding ARPU as implied in the guidance both this year and I suppose in the mid-term now that the $750 million is off the table? Thanks so much. John Rainey : Sure, Tien-Tsin. I\u2019ll start and Dan might want to jump in. Look, I\u2019ll start with some context. We\u2019re a data-driven business. And if you just look at the last year, we did almost 20 billion transactions on our platform. And each of those transactions has hundreds of signals about that transaction. What was the size of the transaction? What was the price point? Was it on a mobile device? It was at a repeat customer? Did it happen after a P2P transaction, and that informs our strategy. And we analyze that \u2013 and informs the strategy. We measure the results, and it creates this feedback that we then refine and pivot our strategies as well. And what we\u2019ve been able see is that when we asses the strategy around trying to retain these very low engaged users versus of tempting to move people up maybe from the medium engaged user to the high engaged user group. The ladder is much more effective for us to focus on engagement. And I think it\u2019s important to note, we are not a subscription model business, where there is a direct relationship between our net new actives and the amount of revenue. As I noted in my prepared remarks, there is a Pareto dynamic in our business where the vast majority of our volume comes from about third of our customers. And so we think that we need to pivot to evolve with the feedback that we\u2019ve received and go achieve our medium-term guidance a different way than what we initially have laid out. But importantly, there is very encouraging signs that we see around engagement. And we\u2019ve talked about some of those. But when we, for instance, add a \u2013 provide a separate product or service for a customer, and they are engaging with us in a different way. The ARPU for that customer increases appreciably. And so this is a pivot in our strategy. We think it\u2019s appropriate for our business, but it does not mean that we don\u2019t have confidence in our medium-term outlook as it relates to both revenue and earnings and free cash flow. Dan Schulman : Maybe I\u2019ll just add a couple of things onto John\u2019s response. First of all, we did put on 122 million NNAs over the last 2 years, which is obviously substantially more than what our pre pandemic levels were. And within that, there are always a number that are low engaged or have done one transaction and nothing else. And we drove some programs, incentive-based programs to see if they would reengage and then engage back with the base. And what we found is that they were due one transaction and then fall dormant again. And so our view is spending money on lower-value NNAs that are not engaged in the base becomes an increasingly expensive proposition over time and does nothing for our revenue growth. In fact, this year, when we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re going to do $15 million to $20 million, it\u2019s probably going to be about $20 million incremental one-and-done customers that roll off. That does nothing to our revenue that is actually just people coming out of the base that were never engaged. Over time, we feel like our NNAs are that revert more back to pre pandemic, which was in the $30 million to $40 million a year range. And could that change slightly? Could that be more as we go into more international penetration we\u2019re seeing some very encouraging signs, as John said, with a digital wallet, where if somebody adds one more service to the digital wallet, their average revenue per active goes up by 25%. The average revenue per active of the digital wallet user is 2x that of a checkout only. And so we really feel like we are going to invest our dollars in the best way to drive our revenues and our earnings and in the most efficient way. So we have great confidence in the medium-term outlook. And this shift is one that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t bring on tens of millions of NNAs every quarter. It just means that we\u2019re not going to throw marketing dollars at low-value subscribers coming in. And that, as John mentioned in his remarks, is a conscientious choice that we\u2019re making. Tien- Tsin Huang : Very clear. Appreciate your thoughts. Dan Schulman : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Darrin Peller : Hi, thanks, guys. Can you just \u2013 can you touch on the assumptions for your revenue guidance? I know your 15% to 17% is obviously lower than the prior 18% as of expected as of a few months ago. So maybe John or Dan, if you could just touch on the magnitude of ARPU expansion or consider and perhaps any color on the take rate or other factors? And just maybe any assumptions that might be conservative here and also, John, just the cadence and trajectory, I know you talked about exiting the year at 20% plus growth rates. Obviously, it\u2019s great to hear just we need a good ramp as the year progresses. So anyway, thanks guys. Any color that will be all. John Raineys : Sure, Darrin. You packed a lot into that one question. I\u2019ll try to get most of it. So look, as I noted, we are adopting a more conservative stance on the year, and that\u2019s informed allowed by what we\u2019ve seen over the last 8 to 10 weeks in our business. And I think underlying the outlook that we have for 2022 is e-commerce growth. The consensus estimates that we see are in the kind of the 10% range. And so that\u2019s sort of a fundamental assumption to start with. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen weakness around spending in our lower income cohorts. And imagine for us, it\u2019s \u2013 the percentage of our user base is pretty similar to what you see just like in the U.S. overall. So it is a large percentage of our user base. And this was a cohort that certainly benefited from stimulus in prior periods earlier this year. And we\u2019re seeing the effects of inflationary pricing around that where there is a more elastic demand curve around that. Certainly, with higher income cohorts, you\u2019ve got a more inelastic demand curve, and that\u2019s a lower percentage of our base. But generally speaking, I don\u2019t think people are going out and buying boats with Venmo. And maybe they are, but this has had an impact on our business. And so when we provide that range of revenue guidance for the year, if this persists and doesn\u2019t improve, then it\u2019s going to be at the lower end of that range. If it improves appreciably, then it\u2019s the upper end of that range. And so if you take the midpoint, we do have some expectation that some of the supply chain issues and inflationary pressures that we\u2019ve seen right now, improved in the back half of the year. With respect to cadence, the first half of the year, clearly is the most difficult from a year-over-year comp perspective and most notably because of the impact that eBay has in our business, Dan talked about, in his prepared remarks, sort of the impact that it has $600 million in the first quarter as we get that \u2013 I am sorry, first half, I am sorry, first half. As we get passed that and also at the same time begin to see some of the benefits from some of our new product initiatives rollout through the year. The second half will be much better and look, we want as much as anyone to demonstrate to all of you the power of our business and so we are very much looking forward to that back half of the year and an exit rate there is much more in line with our medium-term guidance. Dan Schulman : Darrin, I think also if you uncouple the headline revenue numbers from our revenue numbers ex-eBay and look at it whether it would be in the fourth quarter 22% revenue growth ex-eBay, growing over 27% revenue growth ex-eBay from a year ago. And you look at that 2-year CAGR, it\u2019s about 25% CAGR. You look in the first quarter, which is our low quarter of the year. And ex-eBay, we are growing revenues 13% on top of 38% revenue growth ex-eBay a year ago. Add the two up, you have got a 2-year CAGR of about 25% again. So, what I was saying in my remarks is that our business ex-eBay is remarkably consistent and our 2-year CAGRs are also remarkably consistent. And so we are lapping eBay, which goes away by the end of June as we go into the back half of the year, and we are also lapping our two strongest quarters of growth in the first and second quarter. And just as we look at the math of that and then on top of that, obviously, all the initiatives that we are doing, we see growth rates exceeding 20% plus as we exit the year. And I think if you look behind the headline numbers, you can see those numbers have maintained their strength quarter-over-quarter. Darrin Peller : Great. Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the take rate. It did stop, I think, a 2-year decline. And just thinking about it going forward with the Venmo monetization, especially Pay with Venmo being a factor, thinking about pricing, if there is any other benefits domestically or internationally there, and then mix P2P versus branded and Braintree. It looks like from the guide that take rate, the moderation of take rate going down also alleviates there. So, just thinking about those factors, John, maybe you could help us with that. John Rainey : Sure. Well, we were pleased to see the sequential increase in take rate in the quarter versus the third quarter. And I do think it sort of underscores some of the strength in our business, particularly around pricing and also, as Dan noted, Venmo, quite excited to see that Venmo having achieved it\u2019s roughly $900 million in revenue last year that\u2019s starting to be a contributor to take rate. And we have been saying this for some time. We are glad to actually show the results. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume, though, that Brian, that every quarter, we are going to see a sequential increase going forward. But it\u2019s a step in the right direction. I think maybe a better way to think about take rate for this year is really looking at the factors that drove the year-over-year change. And of course, year-over-year take rate declined. But if you look at that decline of 17 basis points, roughly half of that was related to eBay. And certainly, that goes away as we get into the back half of the year. The other next largest contributor, which was about 4 basis points or 5 basis points related to that decline was a decrease in foreign exchange fees that we monetize on cross-border transactions. And so that sometimes goes up. So, if you look at like the core business, there is actually a very small change in what\u2019s happening with take rate and so quite pleased about that. And I think it really \u2013 like when you also overlay on that, the pricing change that we made that contributed to that I think it underscores the value proposition and how that resonates with our customer base. We are seeing users becoming more loyal to brand ecosystems like ours. And look, when side-by-side given the choice to choose PayPal or other wallets, more than 50% of the time, people are choosing PayPal. And so this shows the strength of our business, the ubiquity, the network effect of it, and that\u2019s translating into the effect on our take rate. And frankly, we are just pleased to see that we don\u2019t have some of the noise that\u2019s been persisting in that comparison over the last couple of years, and we will get into much cleaner compares in the back half of next year. Dan Schulman : Yes. And I think I will just expand on one part of John\u2019s remarks. I mean if you look at Venmo exiting the year with $250 million of revenues growing at 80% plus. I mean as we think about Venmo revenues this year, we can see that our revenue is growing another 50% plus as their average revenue per active continues to grow. And so I think when we look at a bunch of things that before, we are putting pressure on take rate. And now we are seeing the opposite of curve. I think that obviously bodes well at least on the pressure on take rate, if not the stabilization of it. Bryan Keane : Great. Thank you very much. Dan Schulman : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. Alright. Well, it has been a couple of tough quarters here coming out of the pandemic. You have highlighted, of course, in detail the shift from NNA growth to ARPU growth. But beyond that shift, just taking a step back, what are some of the other strategic and operational adjustments you have been making now over you are making in order to adjust to this new world and reaccelerate growth as you look out later into 2022? Dan Schulman : Lisa, there is sort of a little bit of inflation between end of pandemic and us entering into the eye of the eBay transition, which happened concurrently. So, coming out of that, you are lapping very strong growth quarters for us, and we are going into eBay and the pandemic is beginning to end. If people are conflating a lot of that, which is why I was trying to point out that the core business ex-eBay, has been pretty consistent as we have looked over the last several quarters. And clearly, the lapping is going to have an impact, although a lessening impact in the first half of this year until we move into the back half. I would say though the other big thing, Lisa, that we have talked about quite a number of times is sort of the ascendancy of digital wallets, of financial super apps in the \u2013 in checkout. There have been numerous studies. JPM just put out one payments, just put one out, where you are seeing digital wallets take increasing share at checkout. And clearly, there is no other digital wallet close to us in terms of scale, and there is overwhelming consumer preference for PayPal in those wallets. And our super app is showing extraordinarily promising early results. Now, we only rolled that out fully in the middle of October across all of iOS and Android, so we are three months or four months into it. But what are we seeing, we are seeing double the average revenue per active account when somebody uses our app versus just checkout. When somebody uses the app their propensity to churn is 25% less. The discoverability and first-time users of people coming into the app, crypto is up 40%, in-app donations are up 300%, people coming into our shopping tab is up 35%, people going from the shopping tab to merchants to shop is up over 700%. And so we are really encouraged by what we are seeing on the app. And by the way, the app, only about 50% of our base has the app right now. So, it still has quite a bit of ways to go to penetrate and we want to spend marketing dollars on moving people into that app. And inside the app, like things like bill pay, like you and I have talked about many times, we are seeing a 200% increase in first-time users there. We want to make sure that people can discover the services because every time they add another service, it grows ARPA by 25%. And so we are going to focus heavily on digital wallet. We are going to continue to focus on checkout because that checking out is the bread and butter of PayPal, and we have a best-in-class experience, and we feel there are numerous ways. We continue to improve that. We are going to increase buy now, pay later capabilities, which is on a tremendous role. And also move into a focused set of international markets from leveraging the LISC extension we just got in China for an incremental 5 years, leveraging off the Paidy acquisition in Japan and really looking at markets like Mexico and potentially Brazil to accelerate. So, a number of things that we are very focused on. And the final thing that I would say that John mentioned in his script and I did in mine as well is that we think that there is the opportunity for significant increased operating leverage, utilizing our scale and having our OpEx growth move back more towards normalized growth that we had pre-pandemic, which we think will help expand margins as we go forward. And that scale is clearly going to enable us to leverage improved unit economics going forward. And so those are kind of the operational changes where we are focused and why we have such confidence that as we go through the year, you will see acceleration of revenues and earnings improving at 20%. Lisa Ellis : Very helpful. Thank you. Dan Schulman : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. So, I know you have said that you are positioned to achieve the medium-term revenue and EPS targets over the last 3 years of the 5-year guidance period. So, are we to assume that you expect to be below those levels when we look at the 5-year CAGR basis in its entirety? And I guess, if not, if you still think you can achieve these targets on the 5-year basis, what would really drive the necessary increase in engagement? Thank you. John Rainey : Sure, Jason. It\u2019s good to speak with you. I appreciate the clarifying question. So look, any time you put out a longer-range plan over multiple years, it\u2019s rarer than anyone ever assumes a business cycle in there and not that we are exactly going through the business cycle, but we are certainly seeing some macroeconomic pressures on our business that were not contemplated at the time that we did our guidance. So, you are correct in that we have confidence that we can achieve those growth rates of 20% revenue and 22% earnings growth in the out years beyond 2022. But because we have not done that in the first 2 years of that, you are correct, mathematically, that CAGR is much more \u2013 that compounded annual growth rate is much more challenging. But when you step back and you think about the core earnings power of the business, the core growth opportunities that we have, look, e-commerce is still going to grow. We are still seeing a pull forward around that. We are still seeing the increase in digital payments, the primacy of the digital wallet, all of these things benefit us. And I would say even benefit us even more because of the scale and brand that we have. And so we shouldn\u2019t conflate like changes in real disposable income of people with digitization trends, which benefit our business. I would argue that our competitive positioning has never been stronger. And so we are very focused in 2023, \u201824 and \u201825 and demonstrating that we can achieve those growth rates. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Appreciate the clarification. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks so much. This was touched on a bit earlier, but given the 2022 headwinds you have discussed, what are some of the structural changes you see sustaining as we enter 2023, for example, you have called out 20% plus expected revenue growth as you exit 2022. And then related to that, with the pivot to increase focus on growing engagement? What\u2019s the timeline of new applications we should watch for in the expansion of the PayPal super apps? John Rainey : Where to start? Well, maybe I will start with the first part of your question, David, on some of the structural changes and we covered this a little bit in a couple of questions, but we continue to see a movement, particularly in checkout or gravitation towards digital wallets versus other ways to pay. And in fact, in some studies, it would suggest that PayPal is second only to debit in front of credit in terms of preference from consumers. And as I noted earlier, like you are beginning to see more and more preference for brand ecosystems. And we think that\u2019s only going to become more relevant as we go forward, which is part and parcel to why we are emphasizing our digital wallet strategy so much because when someone is using our app is using our digital wallet. They are much more likely to be engaged with us in other parts of our ecosystem, including offline transactions. And so all of these things, I think are structural changes related to the pandemic that getting the timing precisely correct on when we reach that, that pivot or that step function change is sometimes difficult. But I don\u2019t think anyone would argue that we are continuing down that trend and it\u2019s only been accelerated during the pandemic. Dan Schulman : Just add to it a couple of things. One, obviously, we feel like supply chain issues will work their way through. This actually is impacting quite profitable revenue streams for us like cross-border. When we look at export out of China, that\u2019s double-digit negative, and it\u2019s typically double-digit positive for us, and that will turn its way around going forward. So, we know some of these things are temporal and will change over time. But we wanted to be measured in the guidance that we put out for this year. And on the digital wallet, we put out a ton of new functionality out there. We are just started to ramp the high-yield savings product that we are introducing with Synchrony. That started at the end of January. We are aiming to be 100% ramped with that by the end of Q1, early Q2. We are \u2013 have quite a number of people on the waiting list for that. And we want to really spend a lot of our efforts this year, enhancing each of those various products and services to create best-in-class value propositions around every single one of them. I think we have a really comprehensive, good first step of our digital wallet. I think each of these areas can be linked better to each other. The value propositions can improve, we will add incremental features over time, but really our opportunity this year is expand our app penetration because we see what happens when that occurs. And then when people are in the app, introducing to more and more services because that has a tremendous amount of leverage in the business model. David Togut : Thank you very much. Dan Schulman : You bet. Operator : And we have time for one last question from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. When we think about your revenue growth, we like to think about what Venmo could contribute? And then we like to think about what the onus is on sort of the rest of the business, if you will. I know you mentioned that Venmo did roughly $250 million in Q4, and I think it was around that $900 million for the full year. Dan, you alluded to this earlier in terms of growth for next year, what could you tell us in terms of what is implied for next year\u2019s or for fiscal 2022 in terms of Venmo growth and revenue monetization? And how that might look into 2023 and beyond as well? Dan Schulman : Yes. I think this year, we are contemplating 50% plus revenue growth for Venmo on top of what it did this year. Obviously, they are continuing to add incremental services. Eventually, you are going to see Venmo have a lot of the capabilities that the PayPal super app has because that consumer base loves Venmo, or wants to live more and more of their financial life on the app. We have over 83 million people using Venmo right now in the United States. Think about that as a percentage of the population. Yes, it\u2019s one like out of every 3.5 people in the U.S. is using Venmo right now. We obviously have plans to take that overseas. We are going to be rolling out Venmo with Amazon, with Starbucks, with DoorDash, I mean there are quite a number of very high-profile merchants that are going to be implementing pay with Venmo on top of all of the things that they did last year. And so we have got a lot of promise yet to go, as I mentioned. I feel like we are in the beginning stages of the monetization progress, team is executing extremely well against both their objectives, but really importantly, against the roadmap as well. And so I think you just continue to see Venmo grow. And by the way, when it grows, obviously, its ARPU grows and as I mentioned in my remarks, it starts to add to our ability to grow take rates certainly that adds to an upward pressure on take rate as opposed to a downward one. I think that was our final question. I do want to thank everybody for all of your great questions. We really appreciate it. Realize there is a lot of information that we put out today. We want to thank you for your time as well. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon, and meeting with you in person. And again, thank you for your time. Take care, and bye-bye.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PayPal Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter 2022. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022 and our medium-term outlook. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 27, 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We obviously have a lot to cover today. But before I begin my formal remarks, I want to start by saying how dismayed we are at the atrocities happening in Ukraine. Early on, we suspended our transactional services in Russia and worked quickly to enable PayPal's send and receive services in Ukraine. Since then, our platform has enabled approximately $100 million to be sent to Ukrainian citizens and refugees. In addition, thanks to the generosity of our community, nearly $0.5 billion has been sent over our platform to leading nonprofit organizations supporting Ukraine. It is in times like these that we are most reminded of the essential role our platform and services provide to those most in need. This afternoon, in the interest of time, I'm going to briefly cover our first quarter results, before I provide a strategic update and discuss our outlook for the quarter and year ahead. We have provided additional coverage of our Q1 results in our investor update presentation. As all of you know, after almost 7 years at PayPal, John Rainey will be leaving the company to join the leadership team at Walmart. I'm happy for John. And I'm not surprised that the Fortune 1 company has recognized all that John has done to help build PayPal into what it is today. John, I'm going to miss you, and I wish you the very best of success and happiness in your next chapter. I also want to say that I'm thrilled that the Board has appointed Gabrielle Rabinovitch as Interim CFO. The 3 of us are here together, and we will be handling Q&A as a team. I want to begin my prepared remarks by acknowledging that our shareholders expect more from us than our track record over the past several quarters has delivered. And I take full accountability for that. Navigating through the pandemic and an uncertain macroeconomic environment with resulting shifts in consumer behavior has made visibility more challenging. But we need to do better, and you will hear more from us today about delivering on our commitments. Before we talk more about our go-forward focus, let me touch on our Q1 results. I'm pleased to report we delivered solid results that exceeded our guidance on revenue and earnings. The first quarter of 2021 was the strongest in our history, with 31% spot revenue growth and 84% non-GAAP EPS growth. And despite lapping this growth, revenues increased 7% to $6.48 billion and increased 15%, excluding eBay. U.S. revenues grew 20%, and international revenue decreased 5%. Ex eBay, international revenue grew 5%, which was on top of 47% growth in Q1 last year. Volume-based expenses increased 25% and represent 49% of revenue versus 42% of revenue last year. This uptick of approximately 700 basis points resulted from increased funding costs driven primarily by volume mix and lapping the release of $84 million of credit reserves. Nontransaction-related expenses grew 8% in the quarter and represented 30% of revenue, which was flat to last year. Investments in technology and development were offset by leverage in our other nontransaction operating expenses. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 in the quarter, absorbing an incremental $0.03 of earnings pressure due to our suspension of transactional services in Russia. We also generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.5 billion in capital to stockholders through share repurchases. As I shared last quarter, we are increasing our emphasis on incremental engagement across our existing customer base while continuing to add higher-value accounts. In Q1, we added 2.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, bringing our total active base to 429 million. Our transactions per active account grew 11% to 47. We continue to be pleased with our Buy Now, Pay Later franchise, which is seeing persistent market share gains. We did $3.6 billion in volume in Q1, up 256%, with over 18 million consumer accounts choosing this funding option since launch. And we are seeing increased merchant penetration and upstream presentment, which will allow us to continue to deliver strong results. In Q1, Braintree outperformed again, with volumes growing 61%. This growth comes with the success of key customers like Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash, Live Nation, vineyard vines and TikTok. Importantly, for many of these merchants, we are their exclusive or primary provider of unbranded processing. In addition, Venmo delivered strong revenue performance in Q1, with growth of approximately 60%. Volume grew 12% to $58 billion, on top of 63% growth a year ago. Venmo now has more than 85 million accounts in the U.S. And our goal in the coming year is to drive more commerce transactions on Venmo while continuing to be a leading P2P platform. We are making progress in driving more Pay with Venmo transactions, business profiles and off-line purchases with the Venmo debit and credit cards. And our integration plans with Amazon are progressing, with the back half of the year as our current launch time frame. Across both PayPal and Venmo, we are working hard to have our digital wallets at the center of our consumers' daily financial lives. Our redesigned PayPal digital wallet app is now installed by over 50% of our base, and our app users are engaging with more features and driving incremental average revenue per account as a result. Customers who use our digital wallet transact 25% more at checkout than users that are not using the app. And over 70% of our Buy Now, Pay Later users engage through our digital wallet. We have nearly completed the rollout of our savings product, and we will be introducing additional financial services and commerce functionality in the coming quarters. Our digital wallet ARPA is 2x that of a customer who only uses checkout, and the churn rate for digital wallet users is 25% less than the rest of our base. We are focused on increasing adoption of our digital wallet and believe it is one of our most meaningful opportunities to drive growth. In addition, working with partners has been and continues to be an important ingredient to our success. We recently renewed and expanded our strategic partnerships with American Express and Citibank. Our strong and growing relationships with these important partners and others highlight our commitment to offering our customers choice in how they pay by enabling seamless FI integrations into our products and services. I would like to now discuss our outlook for Q2 and the year. While we are pleased that we delivered Q1 with a beat on revenue and EPS, 2022 remains another challenging year to forecast. In laying out our 2022 outlook several months ago, we noted that if macro pressures persisted, we would trend towards the lower end of our range. And if we saw structural improvement, it would push us upwards towards the upper bound. It is clear that relative to early February, the macro environment has deteriorated. Russia, Ukraine and China are contributing to increased global uncertainty and incremental inflationary and supply chain pressures. And more specific to PayPal, forecasting normalized consumer e-commerce spending, as we come out of the pandemic, is exceedingly complex. As a result, we believe it is prudent to lower our 2022 guidance and reevaluate our medium-term outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 9% and non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.86. We expect a bit more than $200 million of impact from eBay in Q2. And we have tough comps as eBay revenue grew -- as eBay -- ex eBay revenue, excuse me, grew 32% in the second quarter last year. We also had reserve releases of $156 million in Q2 2021, which creates an approximate $0.11 headwind to earnings growth. For the year, we now expect 11% to 13% revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.81 to $3.93. Ex eBay, this represents revenue growth of approximately 15% to 17%. In addition, at the midpoint of our range, this equates to back-half revenue growth of 15.5%. Our revised EPS guidance reflects the flow-through implications of our revenue expectations and volume mix. We are now forecasting 10 million net new active accounts for the year. We expect to add positive NNAs to our platform every quarter this year, with Q2 representing the low point. I want to share additional context about the work we are doing to increase our operating leverage. Pre-pandemic, we were in the process of simplifying our operating model and enhancing our operating efficiency. The pandemic forced us to put many of those initiatives on hold to simply scale the business and support the unprecedented growth on our platform. We are now coming back to this work with renewed focus, energy and purpose. While we are focused on incorporating more discipline into our operating model and driving operating leverage in our business, we are simultaneously investing to grow. We see opportunities to accelerate our growth and customer engagement. We believe our portfolio of digital payment assets is unmatched in breadth and depth, which creates a powerful competitive advantage for us. To extend this advantage and advance our leadership position, our focus on streamlining and improving the way we work is critical and will allow us to achieve more efficient growth. Overall, these efforts will yield significant savings, allowing us to continue to reinvest in the business and drive profitable growth. For the year, we now expect to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we still plan to balance capital allocation between investing organically in our business, share repurchase and inorganic growth. That said, to be clear, transformative acquisitions are not on our growth agenda at this time. We currently expect that any activity for the foreseeable future will be focused on straightforward deals that have clear and unassailable alignment with our skills and capabilities. Finally, I would like to discuss our medium-term outlook that was provided at our Investor Day in February of 2021. We have reassessed the feasibility of achieving our revenue and earnings targets. These targets relied on several baseline assumptions, relating to both e-commerce penetration and macroeconomic factors that are no longer on the trajectory that we forecasted. As a result, we're withdrawing our medium-term outlook. We will continue to guide revenue and earnings on both a quarter and full year basis and continue to update you on how we are thinking about our business over the long term. Make no mistake, we have strong conviction in the growth potential of our business and our ability to sustainably create value for our shareholders. However, we recognize the need to level-set expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. We know the scale of our 2-sided platform is truly differentiated and gives us strong competitive advantage. We believe the secular tailwinds from the digitization of payments and e-commerce growth are persistent. And we believe that we are uniquely positioned to bring more merchants and consumers together globally than any other company and help them connect and transact safely. We continue to have many opportunities in front of us, given the scale of our 2-sided network and the ongoing growth in digitized payments. We will advance our leadership in checkout, continue our work to become the preeminent digital wallet and bring PayPal's tools to more in-person context, all the while investing in our foundational technologies. Hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of millions of merchants value our comprehensive set of products and services. And we are investing resources to both improve our existing products and innovate for the future with capabilities, including enhanced loyalty programs, package tracking and returns management. With branded checkout and full-stack processing as the foundational elements of our platform and competitive advantage, the opportunities ahead are significant. And we believe PayPal is well positioned to play a leading role in driving the future of digital payments and commerce. We believe we will continue to grow revenue faster than the rate of e-commerce growth and increase our market share in digital payments. At the same time, we will continue to focus on improving operating leverage to support sustained value creation, accelerating the velocity of getting product into the hands of our customers and driving greater organizational effectiveness by simplifying processes and increasing accountability. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year unfolds. And with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : And good to hear your voices. John, we will miss you, of course. Dan, this one's for you, maybe just building on how you just closed the formal remarks. Reflecting back on the challenges over these past 6 to 8 months, what, in your view, are the top 3 or 4 things that PayPal really needs to do differently going forward to turn around the trajectory of the business? Daniel Schulman : Yes. It's good to hear your voice as well, Lisa. I feel the same way about John. So look, it's been a difficult several quarters for us in accurately forecasting on what our business would look like. I will say that, over the past 5 years, we very consistently gained market share as true also in Q1, if you look across the different products and capabilities we offer. And so I think we need to, one, kind of rethink, and we've tried to start to do this year, our philosophy and methodology around forecasting. And we'll talk probably about that later. I'm sure there will be conversations about that. Second, I think there are less things we need to do extremely well. And so we are really going to be focusing on checkout, and we can talk about that in more detail later in the call, but we have a number of initiatives on advancing our position in checkout and also thinking about next-generation checkout as well. And we also need to double-down on the digital wallet. We clearly believe that's where the future of the industry is going. It's the future of PayPal. It is the heart of what we are trying to do from an engagement perspective. And so those are the 2 things that we really need to double-down on. I would say the third thing is we need to go back to where we were before we came into the pandemic, with a real focus on our operating model, making sure we simplify and streamline, putting more and more accountability into the hands of our product managers and driving really end-to-end accountability and ownership across the whole business. And so there are clearly a lot of things we need to do. I feel like we're beginning to make good progress on some of the execution. Q1 was a piece of that and some of the metrics are -- we're seeing green shoots on that. But we've just got to stay focused and keep driving simplification and operating leverage in our model. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : And may I also start by saying thank you to John and absolutely wish you nothing but the best. I'll ask on the outlook. I know Lisa asked a good question on what's going to change, but I'm just trying to better understand the full year vision to revenue and EPS and where you're landing now versus 90 days ago. So it looks like the eBay assumption is the same. So how much of the change is due to macro factors versus maybe you know a little bit more about the impacts of your strategy shift? And of course, how much did conservatism play a role, recognizing, as you said, visibility is tough and you have a CFO seat to fill, et cetera? John Rainey : Sure, Tien-Tsin. I'll start. And let me first say thank you for your comments. And I think Gabrielle will probably jump in on this as well. But I'll give a little bit of color to the way that we're thinking about guidance. And so you'll recall, and Dan also referred to this in his prepared remarks, that at the last quarter, when we gave a revenue range of 15% to 17%, we very clearly said if things did not improve, we would be at the low end of that range. And that's a different approach to the guidance that we have today, insofar as we are actually assuming that things get a little worse from here. It's been challenging forecasting sort of the return or the normalization of e-commerce trends post-pandemic. And we've been chasing this for a little bit, and we don't want to continue to find ourselves in that situation. So if you sort of contrast where we are today with when we gave that guidance, not only have things not improved, I think very clearly, they've gotten worse. We've got a war that's broken out in Ukraine. We've seen more supply chain issues that are acute in places like China. You've got even higher inflation now, which is, I think, disproportionately affecting our customer base that skews more towards discretionary spend versus nondiscretionary spend. All of these things affect the way that we're approaching the outlook for the year. Gabrielle, do you want to add anything? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, sure. Thanks, John. So Tien-Tsin, in terms of sort of lowering the revenue outlook, in addition to what John mentioned around just the macro worsening and what that means for our overall growth expectations in our core markets, we also, to John's point, sort of took a look at what we're seeing on our own platform. And that really relates to sort of e-commerce and consumer behavior. It does have that sort of macro intersection, but for us, because we have more of a discretionary platform, we do see a greater impact on the spend. And so relative to how we started the year, e-commerce globally is slower than what we thought, and we're seeing that come through on our platform. And so we're reflecting that, and that's both in terms of just the spending patterns as well as off-line/online mix. So that's sort of how we're thinking about starting the year. It's really not about our overall conviction in the secular tailwinds that support the business, but we want to be realistic about what we're seeing in-year and adjust that outlook for that. The final contributor to it on the revenue side is really that we've recalibrated our expectations on some of our initiatives at PayPal based upon those lower global growth expectations. And so we wanted to have a consistency in that conservatism around what we think are sort of newer initiatives can deliver in-year given some of those macro impacts. On the EPS side, it's really a flow-through of some of these things, but maybe just something I would call out is from a volume standpoint. We are seeing outsized performance from Braintree. So that unbranded processing mix does play a role in the overall profitability of the business. And so we're taking down EPS, in part, for that. In addition to that, we're continuing to invest heavily in the areas that we think are important to drive that long-term profitable growth. And so that's what you're seeing sort of in terms of the overall impact to EPS. One other call-out would just be suspending transaction services in Russia does have an EPS impact as well, and so we have adjusted our outlook for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : John, I also want to wish you the best. And guys, when we look at -- yes, when we look at the guidance that you guys gave, and I know you withdrew the medium term, which I think a lot of investors expected at this point, but the exit year, if you could just help us understand the cadence of the year and then the exit growth rate implied by the new guide range and maybe a little more on the assumptions behind that exit rate. Daniel Schulman : Yes. Sure, Darrin. I'll start off there and then see if Gabs or John want to add to it. So as I said in my remarks, what the back half implies with our 11% to 13% is a 15.5% revenue growth in the back half, so mid-teens, in general, with that. And then as we think about EPS, there are a number of onetime events on our EPS growth rates. But when we think about kind of like what is an exit as we go into next year, just kind of on a normalized basis, it's probably in the mid-teens as well. And as we think about the medium term, the thing that I talked about in my script is that we've had a long track record of taking share and growing faster than e-commerce. And so as you're thinking about kind of what does that medium term look like, it really depends on your view of kind of where e-commerce is going to come out. We'll take a look, but there are a lot of shifting estimates right now, as John mentioned, coming out of the pandemic, now coming into a high inflation kind of a macroeconomic environment that's uncertain. And the magnitude of that uncertainty is wider. We felt it was best to characterize kind of what the company expects to do over the medium term as opposed to put out any specific numbers. John Rainey : I'll just add too, Darrin, that, look, no company wants to be in the position of pulling their medium-term guidance. But when you step back and you look at the set of assumptions on which we base that medium-term guidance, they're very, very different today. That said, and perhaps I'm in a unique position to say this, that doesn't take away our conviction and the long-term value and the prospects for this business at all. This -- there are a few companies of our size and scale in digital payments that have some of the unique attributes that we have around our cash flow generation, our revenue growth and the margin profile that we do. And so we're not immune to some of these economic vagaries that we're going through right now. But we've got to respond to that. And -- but that should not take away from how you think about our business longer-term. And again, we are perhaps the purest play in digital payments, and we're going to continue to invest appropriately to make sure that we stay that way and stay a leader in digital payments going forward. Daniel Schulman : Yes. And if I can just jump on top of John's points. Like at some point, these trends tend to turn as well, but when that happens is unclear. And so we know, as long as we continue to invest, to seize those growth opportunities, to ensure that our growth remains in excess of that of e-commerce, when these things do change, we'll be beneficiaries of that as well. So we just want to be heads down, focused on the things we control and execute really well against them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wonder if you could give us an update on the kind of pivot to focusing more on customer engagement versus acquisition. And I guess, specifically, do you have all the tools that you need now to sort of execute on this shift? Is there more development or M&A or incremental technology or resources that you're going to need to dedicate to the new strategy? Or are you kind of set where you are now to make it happen? Daniel Schulman : Yes. It's at such a fast-moving environment that we operate in, with constant innovation, that we're never in a place where we're not going to need to continue to innovate and invest in the business. I think we've made some really important strides in the past year or so with the advent of our digital wallet. We clearly think that the world is continuing to digitize. Yes, there's some normalization between online and off-line right now. But going forward, the world continues to digitize. And disparate parts of the economy are coming together, whether that be shopping, payments, basic financial services. And so the wallet is going to be one of the key elements of how we drive customer engagement. And we're going to continue to evolve the wallet. It is v 1.0 right now. And there's going to be v 2.0 and v 3.0, and we've got a number of things on our road map that we really want to execute against this year. But we're already beginning to see uptick in our engagement. For the second quarter in a row, we had 11% TPA. Ex eBay, actually, engagement went up 19% in the quarter. That's a pretty big move in terms of engagement. And you heard the stats that I talked about in my script in terms of the increases in ARPA, the decreases in churn. And as you think about kind of our growth going forward, 30% of our customers generate 80% of the volume on our platform. We're clearly not a subscription business, we're a transaction-based business. And growing those transactions is a huge opportunity for us. We probably, today, have like 25% of the online financial transactions that a consumer does. And so there's a ton of room for us to grow in that area. I would also say the surest way for us to grow net new actives going forward is to increase engagement. Like when you're at 429 million active accounts, even with a consistent churn rate year-over-year, and by the way, we know, this year, our churn rate will be somewhat higher because we're letting these low engaged consumers churn off the platform because the ROI to keep them isn't worth it. But the more we can keep people on the platform engaged, the more we'll grow our NNAs going forward. And so the 2 big things we're focused on, improving checkout, improving digital wallet, are the things that we'll probably be talking about for years to come actually. Anything you would add? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to shift over to Venmo for a minute, if I could. I know that volume growth started the year at 12%. Clearly, there was a tough comp there. I'm just wondering whether or not any of the new IRS rules around reporting of these transactions is having any impact there, how you expect Venmo volume growth to evolve during the course of the year. I know you started really strong on the revenue side, with Venmo at 60% in Q1. So fair to assume you still expect 50%-plus revenue growth from Venmo this year? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, Jason, I think we continue to expect the 50% revenue growth for Venmo this year. To your question on sort of the IRS change, I would say, very early in the year, we did see some impact from that. We've worked a ton on customer comprehension and education. So we think that's basically behind us, just in terms of what the impact could be. But we also are up against really tough comps. And so last year's Q1 was 63% growth for Venmo, this year, 12%. The business has scaled to the point that it's actually meaningfully larger than what our U.S. business was coming out of separation. And so at this point, we continue to expect strong growth, but it's going to be a mix of commerce volumes and revenue as well as the P2P piece. Dan, anything to add? Daniel Schulman : I would just say they've got a strong road map ahead of them, putting in business profiles, transitioning that almost into storefronts, enabling charities to be a part -- listed on Venmo, the full debit card refreshed, revamping P2P, even improving searchability and other things around that. So they've got a -- and then, of course, launching Amazon in the back half of the year. So they've got a pretty full road map. And I think Gab summarized all the other points perfectly. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I wanted to ask about TPV. When I look at total payment volume in the quarter, I see the dichotomy between U.S. growth, up 21%, and international, only up 5%. So clearly, international is growing slower than the U.S. So wondering, when I look at the international market, what are some of the factors there that are influencing the growth rates. Is it inflation? Is the Ukraine situation bleeding into other parts of Europe? Is there any share loss? Any color on that would be great. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Bryan. I think the 2 main drivers really are, in first instance, actually very challenging comps. We're up against very, very tough comps from last year. So Q1 of last year, international revenue growth, 38% in the quarter, and it was 47% ex eBay. So that alone is sort of one of the drivers this year. The other big piece really is the eBay component. And so that too is playing a role. So on the revenue side, international revenue growth, ex eBay, was up 5%, relative to the negative side that you see. Probably also worth highlighting, that China and U.K. continue to be tough markets for us, and that is both the eBay migration, but it really is also the macro. And so that's one where we're watching it really closely. We did see sort of China revenue down more than it was in Q4., U.K. revenue down again more than it was in Q4, and so we'll continue to watch it closely, but that definitely does have a macro layer to it. Bryan Keane : Got it. And good luck, John. John Rainey : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : I would like to ask about competition. Specifically, there have been some high-profile challenges reported for startups in the one-click checkout space. Could you talk a little bit about some of the benefits of PayPal's scale that may create barriers to entry among new entrants and where you're most focused as it relates to competition, if not necessarily new competitors? Daniel Schulman : Yes. Well, as you point out, look, checkout is our business. I mean you've got to be able to scale it. And it's got to be perfect. As you noted, retailers depend completely on a checkout provider. And if it doesn't go right, they can lose a tremendous amount of sales. And so like the brand trust we have and our track record over time, our availability, our fraud and risk capabilities, have been honed over the last 10 or 15 years. Like on average, a retailer that does 100 transactions with PayPal, we approve 6 more than somebody else -- another checkout methodology. These make huge differences. I would say, the other thing, of course, is that it is a network effects business. The larger the scale, the more attractive the network is. And when you do consumer surveys, 60% of consumers pick PayPal as their #1 choice to do an online transaction. The next closest digital wallet is 8%. So it's not even close. PayPal customers are 2x more likely to shop when they see a PayPal button. And for smaller merchants, having the PayPal brand is essential because in today's age, you're seeing much more e-commerce sales that are outside of local territories. It's across state. It's across the country. It's across countries. And seeing that PayPal brand enables the consumer to feel confident that they've got protection and for a business to feel comfortable because we give them seller protections as well. And so we have a ton of scale advantages and a ton of experience in high auth rates and low loss rates, which typically don't work hand in hand, but they do work that way with us. And look, we are not resting on any of those laurels by any stretch of imagination. We are driving to improve basic hygiene, increased uptime and availability at 99.999% level, taking latency down to low single-digit seconds, simplifying our UX right now. Too often, there's a pop-up that occurs, and it takes you out of the web or the native app. And you don't want to go out and then back into that app. So we want to drive in-context or in-line checkout. We know we can even make our integrations easier and simpler by moving more and more towards industry standard integrations. And we're going to optimize log-on through new identity techniques. And by the way, we are also thinking about the next generation of checkout. The real issue for retailers is not so much can you make conversion better when a consumer gets to the product page or the checkout page, which, by the way, is important because every little bit actually matters to merchants, and we clearly lead in that area. But the real issue is less than 5 out of 100 people who go to a merchant's website actually check out. So there's a ton of drop-off before a consumer gets to the product pages or to the checkout. And basically, nobody has the amount of data and information we have on customers. We vault over 1 billion financial instruments on our platform, well more than that. And being able to work with retailers and consumers, to surface who that consumer is, obviously with consent and all of that, so that a retailer can customize kind of to every customer coming on that have offers or deals or with a homepage they come to is a huge potential next-generation of checkout with a lot of interest from merchants. And nobody can really do that better than we can because of our scale and the data we have. And so I think we got a lot of good advantages right now, but we are really thinking about how do we take it to the next level and how do we even reimagine checkout. Operator : We have time for one last question from David Togut of Evercore. David Togut : All the best to you, John. John Rainey : Thanks, David. David Togut : At the beginning of the pandemic, Dan, you clearly articulated a focus on unified commerce, in particular, a major rollout of QR codes at some of the biggest retailers in the country. And more recently, we've seen consumers return to the physical point-of-sale with increased vaccination rates. Can you update us on how PayPal is positioned in unified commerce, and in particular, where you stand with the QR code rollout? Daniel Schulman : Yes. Well, I think we said from the very beginning, it's proving to be very true, that in-person payments is going to be -- it's going to be a long shot for us going forward. There's no magic word to that. We are continuing to increase, every quarter, the number of retailers that offer our QR codes. But changing consumer behavior to move to mobile and mobile checkout, it's going to take time. It clearly will happen over time, but it's going to take time. And so our view on this is that we really feel like putting quite a large emphasis on revamping our debit and credit card to tie in fully with our app, but enabling a consumer to shop seamlessly. If it's in-store, they want to use a form factor they're familiar with, they can do that. But it ties completely into the app, fully integrated, a little like the Venmo credit card is into the Venmo app. We just launched this 3-2 card, 3% cash-back on any purchase on PayPal, 2% everywhere else, but it is a fully integrated experience. And so, for instance, what might you be able to do with that. You might be able to go into a store, pay with your 3-2 card and then come into the app and do a Buy Now, Pay Later type of thing. So flexibility on choice of how you pay, not just doing it instantaneously. You may want to split that way of paying for that through rewards points and fiat currency. And this, tying in of both using the mobile phone at point-of-sale, but also enabling people to use cards and tie that directly into our app, I think, is probably a good 1-2 punch as we think about moving into in-store. Clearly, Buy Now, Pay Later is exploding everywhere. And we are really gaining good traction there, good traction on upstream presentment, and more and more people want to use that. And that plays, by the way, right into our advantages as well because we have 10 years of credit experience. We think we have the lowest loss rates of the Buy Now, Pay Later industry, probably the highest approval rates because we know so many of the customers and a really powerful value proposition to merchants. And now, we can tie that both online and off-line, and that can be a pretty powerful combination. All right. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. And John, we -- you heard it from everybody, but you'll hear it from us how much we will miss you as well. And... John Rainey : Thank you. I will miss you all as well, too. Daniel Schulman : Yes. And we look forward to working with you, I'm sure, the projection, as well. Okay, everybody. Thanks very much for your time, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Take care. Bye, bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good evening. My name is Savannah, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter 2022. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And I would now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Savannah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2022 and comments related to anticipated cost savings, operating margin and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.  You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, August 2, 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased to share that in the second quarter, we met or exceeded our expectations announced in April, marking the second quarter in a row of hitting our non-GAAP guidance. We are well underway in a deep transformation of our business to regain our momentum. This transformation is supported by 3 major initiatives. The first is to seize the opportunity to grow our market share as many of our competitors retrench and reorient their business models. We are focusing our investments in the areas where we have tremendous advantage due to our scale and the inherent network effects driven by our 2-sided network. We are doubling down on Checkout, our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets and our Braintree platform. These efforts are having their anticipated effect as we, once again, took share in Q2.  Secondly, we are meaningfully reducing our cost structure. I will discuss this in detail, but over the past 6 months, we have taken action to exit the year with operating margin leverage that will continue to grow in 2023. And third, we have reinvigorated our organizational operating model, and we are recruiting world-class talent to our product, engineering and technology functions. And later in my remarks, I'll expand on our progress in these areas.  With that in mind, I'm very pleased to announce that Blake Jorgensen will be joining us as PayPal's new Chief Financial Officer starting this week. Blake joins us from Electronic Arts, where he was CFO and Chief Operating Officer, driving extensive operational excellence and shareholder value. He has also been CFO at Yahoo! and Levi's and was co-Founder and President of the Investment Bank, Thomas Weisel Partners. I am looking forward to working with Blake as we enter the next chapter in PayPal's journey. I would also like to thank Gabrielle for all she has done to support me and the PayPal team in her role as interim CFO. I can't say enough good words about her performance, and I'm pleased to announce that she will be taking on the additional role of Treasurer as well as our investor relations and corporate finance responsibilities.  Let me now turn to our results. Our revenues in the second quarter came in at $6.81 billion, up 10% FXN and 9% spot. Importantly, the shape and dynamics of the quarter reflect the trends we anticipated in our full year guidance. April revenue growth was 7% FXN, May was 10% and June was 12%. And our preliminary revenue growth rate in July further accelerated to north of 14%. eBay payment intermediation was a 400 basis points drag on revenue growth in the quarter, and we anticipate that will drop to approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter and be inconsequential to our results in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.93 exceeded our guidance by $0.07 as actions we have taken slowed nontransaction-related expenses to 6% year-over-year in Q2. As we discussed during our last call, we have been working to drive productivity improvements across all functions. Our strategy shift to focus on customer engagement from our unparalleled network of consumer and merchant accounts led to significant opportunity for greater efficiency and, importantly, deeper investments in our world-class portfolio of assets. We have narrowed our focus, driven greater productivity and increased our market share gains with profitable growth.  We are leveraging our enhanced scale coming out of the pandemic to drive meaningful reductions in unit costs across our supplier base. As a result, we will realize our target of approximately $900 million of savings in 2022 across our OpEx and transaction expenses, which was contemplated in our reset guidance last quarter. We anticipate this reduction in our cost structure will result in at least $1.3 billion of cost savings in 2023, which will result in operating margin expansion next year. These cost savings are not onetime in nature and will continue to benefit the company on a run rate basis.  We are also still sharpening our pencils to identify additional areas of productivity improvements across our servicing, marketing and engineering functions as well as opportunities to rationalize our real estate footprint and shift our hiring to lower-cost geographies. These efficiency gains will allow us to increase our investments in our highest conviction growth opportunities, which, as I mentioned, include Checkout, Braintree and our digital wallets.  Importantly, as a result of this exercise and disciplined leadership from our team, we are targeting nontransaction-related operating expenses to be roughly flat as we exit 2022. Consequently, we expect operating margin expansion beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and continuing in 2023. As we said last quarter, NNAs for Q2 will represent our low watermark for the year. We are reiterating our full year guidance of approximately 10 million NNAs. However, as with all of our forecasts, NNA growth could be affected by broader economic factors, given the channels that drive organic customer acquisition may be negatively impacted by falling consumer sentiment and reduced demand for discretionary goods.  That said, almost 80% of our volume is driven by 30% of our active accounts, which is why our primary focus is on driving engagement across our base. And here, I'm pleased to report that our transactions per active account, or our TPA, grew 12% to 48.7x per year. And our core daily active users are up over 40% from Q2 2019, a 3-year CAGR of about 13%.  Signaling its confidence in our business, the PayPal Board of Directors has authorized an additional $15 billion share repurchase plan. We expect the pace of our share repurchases to remain aggressive as we believe there's currently a unique and attractive opportunity to return capital to our shareholders. Our Board is committed to evaluating all options for return of capital to our shareholders. And we expect to share a financial and strategic update, including capital allocation, at an Investor Day in early 2023. PayPal is one of the most trusted consumer brands in the world, and we have built a diversified platform with unparalleled global scale. We believe the recent turmoil in both the e-commerce and fintech sectors has created an unparalleled opportunity for PayPal. In contrast to others in the industry, our strong financial model, which will generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow this year, provides us the flexibility to invest and strengthen our competitive position.  We are clearly seeing a flight to quality in the market and we expect to continue to drive market share gains. Our share of Branded Checkout grew in Q2 and remains strong with leading retailers, where we are retaining the share gains we drove over the last 2 years. We continue to leverage our inherent strengths in checkout, which include our base of more than 35 million active merchant accounts with billions of financial instruments vaulted across PayPal and Braintree.  We are currently testing our new mobile SDK, software development kit, which enables native in-line checkout, removing friction to make our payment experiences faster and more convenient. And we are also enhancing our checkout user experience to better serve our nearly 400 million consumer accounts, by surfacing the most relevant funding instrument based on past purchase behavior, merchant category and purchase price, among other attributes. We believe innovations like these will continue to differentiate our value proposition and drive increased conversion for our merchants.  We are making great strides in the presentment and global distribution of our branded marks. We have expanded our relationship with Shopify, and we are now powering Shopify Payments in France. In addition, we continue to win large and significant full-stack processing deals with leading merchants across the world, including, Shein, Zappos, BetMGM and Carrefour. We intend to press the advantages we have in scale with our portfolio of payment assets to take additional share in this challenging macro environment.  Our Buy Now, Pay Later products continue to distinguish themselves from our competitors. In the second quarter, we processed $4.9 billion in volume, up 226% year-over-year with over 22 million consumers using our Buy Now, Pay Later services over 100 million times since launch. Our upstream presentment continues to grow with over 200,000 merchants displaying our Buy Now, Pay Later on their product pages. We recently expanded our offerings with the launch of Pay Monthly, which gives U.S. consumers the ability to spread payments over longer periods of time.  A key competitive advantage for us is our deep expertise and experience lending through all types of credit environments. We benefit from both our scale and long-standing relationships with our customers. We know who we are lending to, and as a result, we have high approval rates and loss rates that are among the lowest in the industry.  Our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets are formidable assets that drive engagement across our commerce and payments platform. Digital wallet users are twice as likely to choose PayPal at checkout. And we have an opportunity to increase both engagement and ARPA by continuing to invest in commerce tools. As macroeconomic factors such as inflation impact our customers, our services like PayPal Honey are helping consumers make their money go further. Through the browser extension, PayPal Honey serves up targeted coupons and rewards at checkout. And through our digital wallet shopping hub at the beginning of the shopping journey.  We are working hard to help our customers save money. Already this year, we've helped consumers save over $100 million. In an inflationary environment, these products are increasingly sought after and valuable. In fact, the PayPal Honey browser extension increased selection and conversion at checkout by 18%. And in the second half of this year, we are focused on driving even more savings for our customers by redesigning the shopping hub and our digital wallet and unifying our rewards programs.  Venmo remains a key growth driver for our business with nearly 90 million active accounts, driving revenue growth in Q2 of more than 50%, with the revenues exceeding $100 million last month alone. We continue to see increased commerce transactions on Venmo with commerce volumes growing more than 250%. In Q2, we signed or launched Pay with Venmo with leading merchants, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Draft Kings, booking.com and the Washington Post. And of course, we look forward to launching Pay with Venmo on Amazon.  We are also hard at work on new initiatives that will increase both scale and engagement, including allowing teens to create their own Venmo accounts. And in September, we plan to launch the ability for charities to establish a profile on the Venmo app to encourage more giving ahead of the holiday season.  As I shared last quarter, we are meaningfully streamlining our organizational structure to simplify decision-making, drive end-to-end accountability and make it easier for our teams to rapidly bring innovative products to market. Our new operating model is oriented around our customers. Our consumer business is led by Doug Bland, and Doug joined PayPal through our acquisition of Swift Financial, where he was Chief Operating Officer. He has been leading the rapid expansion of our global credit products, overseeing the introduction of a wide range of products, including our Buy Now, Pay Later services. And he has deep expertise in navigating challenging credit and economic environments.  Our merchant business is organized into 2 primary areas of focus : enterprise and merchant platform led by Frank Keller and small- and medium-sized businesses and partner channels led by Dan Leberman. Both Frank and Dan have been with PayPal since before separation in various leadership capacities and have extensive product and operational expertise. These changes will ensure we make the necessary decisions and trade-offs to accelerate our delivery of the highest-quality products while driving our operating metrics.  Mark Britto, our Chief Product Officer for the past several years, will retire from PayPal at the end of the year. I'm very grateful for Mark's leadership, counsel and friendship during a period of tremendous growth for PayPal and for the strong bench of talent he has cultivated. An external search to replace Mark is well underway, and we expect to announce his replacement in the near future.  In closing, I'd like to acknowledge again that it has been a volatile time for our sector, for our shareholders, for the market and the global economy at large. But we feel this is a unique opportunity for high-quality market leaders like PayPal with strong business models to increase their market leadership. We are laser-focused on delivering on our key initiatives. We continue to take share. While others pull back, we are investing to improve our value proposition.  We are finally moving beyond the lapping of both the pandemic stimulus payouts and eBay intermediated payments. And our increasing revenue growth rate in each successive month of Q2 and July reflect this, setting us up to deliver on our second half expectations. We're driving meaningful productivity and cost improvement in OpEx and our transaction expenses, and we expect to see these actions result in increased operating margins as we exit the year, setting us up for a strong 2023.  And we've made significant and positive changes to our organizational model with several additional talented leaders joining our senior leadership team. I want to thank our PayPal team for their continued dedication and commitment. I'm grateful for the outstanding support you provide each other and our customers each and every day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gabrielle. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. PayPal delivered another solid quarter, meeting or surpassing the second quarter non-GAAP financial targets we shared with you in April. We delivered on our commitment of sequential acceleration in our revenue growth and slowed our nontransaction-related operating expense growth. Our results are indicative of the strength, diversification and breadth of our 2-sided global payments platform. Our team remains focused on what we can control. And more importantly, we're committed to accelerating our core strengths and building PayPal for the future. We are guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers and value for our stakeholders. Over the past 2 quarters, we have seen even stronger opportunities to advance our leadership position in payments and add to our momentum, with our digital wallet, checkout and unbranded processing strategies. Of course, unlike everyone, we're closely monitoring the impact of high inflation on economic growth, consumer demand and sentiment as well as broader global macroeconomic indicators. The backdrop continues to be complex, and we're taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business.  PayPal's unique competitive advantages continue to drive us forward. Today, we believe we are better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. At the same time, we're increasing our rigor in managing our cost structure and prioritizing higher-return strategic initiatives. We are focused on improving our operating margin profile while investing in our key priorities.  Over the years, PayPal has experienced serious business and macro challenges and has emerged stronger every time. As we look ahead, we're confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook. We believe we are operating in an environment in which strong and enduring platforms like ours get stronger. That has never been more apparent than it is today. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 10% on an FX-neutral basis, more than 0.5 point ahead of our guidance and 9% at spot to $6.8 billion. At the time we provided guidance, there was an approximately 30 basis point difference between our spot and FX-neutral growth rates, which essentially doubled during the quarter, given dollar strength.  We expect FX to continue to be a headwind as we move through the back half of 2022. Transaction revenue grew 8% to $6.3 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue grew 21% to $534 million. This performance resulted from solid growth of our credit products as well as increased interest income on customer stored balances.  In the second quarter, U.S. revenue grew 18% while international revenue declined 1%. In addition, on a currency-neutral basis, international revenue increased 1% and, excluding eBay, 8%. On both a spot and currency-neutral basis, international revenue growth accelerated 5 points sequentially. Additionally, eBay Marketplaces' revenue declined 60% to $166 million and represented less than 2.5% of our total revenue. Our revenue, excluding eBay, grew 14% at spot.  Transaction take rate was 1.85% and total take rate was 2%, both essentially flat to last year and to Q1 of this year. The blended take rate on eBay volumes declined to 2.13% from 3.22% in Q2 last year. This was offset by an approximately 5 basis point increase in the take rate on non-eBay volumes, resulting from gains from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue, Venmo and lower P2P volumes.  Transaction expense came in at 90 basis points as a rate of TPV relative to 81 basis points as a rate last year. This result was largely driven by the increase in contribution of Braintree, which is predominantly card-funded, to our overall mix of payment volume. To a lesser extent, funding mix also contributed to higher transaction expenses as a result of more normalized debit card usage relative to 2021.  Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 11 basis points versus 9 basis points in Q2 last year. In addition, credit losses were $68 million or 2 basis points of the rate of TPV. In the second quarter of 2021, we released $156 million of credit reserves, which benefited transaction margin and operating margin performance in the prior period by 250 basis points. In the quarter, loan originations increased and we ended Q2 with $6.2 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 9%. The growth in global Pay Later receivables was the largest driver of originations. The mix of shorter-duration originations from our Pay Later products and strong performance of our loan receivables portfolio resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 7.3% from 8.3% at the end of the first quarter. Overall, our volume-based expenses grew 30%, which in conjunction with 9% revenue growth resulted in a transaction margin of 48.7%. This was 814 basis points lower than last year and represents a 7% decline in transaction margin dollars. Excluding the benefit from reserve release last year, transaction margin dollars declined 2% or 564 basis points as a rate, which was primarily driven by TPV mix.  Starting in the back half of this year, we expect to begin seeing benefits to our transaction expense from leveraging our scale across the network ecosystem. In addition, we have directed our focus on rationalizing nontransaction-related expense growth. In the second quarter, overall, these expenses grew 6% year-over-year, relative to growth of 27% in the second quarter of 2021.  Nontransaction-related expenses represented 29.6% of revenue, an improvement of approximately 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. The growth rates for customer support and operations, sales and marketing and technology and development expenses were meaningfully lower than last year. Notably, sales and marketing spend declined 7% year-over-year in the second quarter, following a 68% increase in Q2 last year.  On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $1.3 billion. Our operating margin was 19.1%, which is nearly 1 point better than our outlook going into the quarter. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS was $0.93, $0.07 stronger than our expectations. In the quarter, we faced an approximate $0.11 per share headwind from the release of credit reserves last year. Our outperformance was predominantly driven by lower nontransaction-related operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate.  We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.6 billion, which includes approximately $6 billion of cash we estimate is needed to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements. Our cash position is inclusive of $3 billion in proceeds from debt we issued in May. Approximately half of the proceeds from this offering were used to refinance upcoming maturities coming due in September 2022 and June 2023. Importantly, through this transaction, we were able to extend our weighted average maturity by approximately 5 years while increasing our average bond coupon by only 70 basis points.  During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $2.3 billion. In the second quarter, we also completed an additional $750 million in share repurchases, bringing 2022 year-to-date repurchase activity to $2.25 billion, representing approximately 95% of free cash flow generated so far this year. We have taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program over the past several quarters. We continue to believe that share repurchase remains an excellent use of capital for our shareholders.  And as Dan mentioned, our Board recently approved a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with the $2.8 billion remaining on our 2018 repurchase authorization, this brings our aggregate outstanding authorization to nearly $18 billion. Given our desire to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our business, we will continue to be opportunistic with the pace and quantum of our share repurchases. Overall, this year, we plan to return 75% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, as we look to optimize our capital allocation and increase our flexibility, we are renewing our focus on credit externalization opportunities. Our last significant credit externalization event occurred in July 2018, when we closed the sale of our U.S. consumer revolving credit portfolio to Synchrony.  Since that time, the composition of our on-balance sheet credit portfolio has changed meaningfully. While today, credit receivables represent about 7% of overall assets versus 17% at the time of the Synchrony transaction, funding our credit products continues to require an increasing amount of our free cash flow. Our credit products are an important driver of customer lifetime value and engagement. In addition, we believe they represent best-in-class products in each of the key credit categories in which we compete. That said, to optimize the use of our balance sheet and remain maximally capital efficient, we're assessing opportunities for additional strategic credit externalization. And we'll update you on our progress as we move through the back half of the year. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. When we provided guidance last quarter, we contemplated that there would be a challenging macro environment for the balance of the year. As everyone has seen across the market, macro conditions remain highly dynamic. We guided last quarter to a range of 11% to 13% revenue growth, and given today's environment, we think it's important to be conservative.  Accordingly, I would point you to the lower end of that range on a currency-neutral basis. While the macro remains uncertain, I also want to underscore that we have strong momentum across the business with accelerating revenue growth from April to May to June and now through July, and the team is focused on achieving our targets for the year. We expect third quarter revenue growth to accelerate 2 points to 12% on a currency-neutral basis and that we will exit the year with revenue growth of approximately 14% in the fourth quarter.  It is important to note that we [indiscernible] a 150 basis point headwind in the third quarter related to revenue we recognized from the PPP lending program in the third quarter last year. Excluding this impact, we expect our third quarter revenue growth to reach nearly 14%, which results in relatively consistent growth in both the third and fourth quarters. The vast majority of the expected acceleration in our top line performance from the first half of 2022 relates to finally having the tougher eBay compares behind us. In addition, we expect the diversification of our platform and the contribution from new initiatives and our merchant pipeline to allow us to exit the year with our business in a stronger position than how we entered 2022. We are also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance and now expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.87 to $3.97. Our cost discipline in conjunction with our efficiency and prioritization initiatives, are enabling us to drive this improved earnings performance.  We also expect that this progress will allow us to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2023. In addition, we remain on track to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow this year. In closing, we're pleased with the progress we're making across many fronts. We're advancing our strategic priorities and, at the same time, sustainably improving our cost structure. The cash flow generating power of our business is a strategic competitive advantage and continues to give us a high degree of flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline. We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.  And while we are not immune to economic headwinds, we will continue to deepen our focus, invest for the long term and strengthen our competitive advantages. Finally, I'd like to welcome Blake to PayPal. I'm absolutely thrilled that he'll be meeting our finance organization and I look forward to supporting him. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gab. So before we start the Q&A section, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide some color on the discussions we've had with Elliott Investment Management. First of all, the discussions have been both constructive and collaborative, and we appreciate the partnership we've built with Jesse Cohn and his team. We are completely aligned in our mutual goal to maximize shareholder value, and we are substantially aligned on the areas of focus for achieving our objectives.  Our discussions are focused on operational improvements, revenue-generating investments and capital allocation, and they are consistent with our short- and long-term objectives and plans. We've been working on a number of initiatives such as improved profitability and return of capital and we appreciate Jesse's collaboration and input on these important topics.  And as we discussed, we're pleased to announce the following : approximately $900 million of cost savings in 2022 across our operating and transaction expenses, with savings potential of at least $1.3 billion through fiscal year '23, an invigorated capital return program including a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, full evaluation of capital return alternatives and an upcoming Investor Day in early 2023 to share operational, capital allocation and strategic updates. We continue to engage with Jesse and his team at Elliott, and they have communicated that their investment is a vote of confidence in our strategy, in our management team and our ability to generate long-term value for shareholders. We have also entered into an information sharing agreement to maintain our collaboration across the previously mentioned initiatives, and we look forward to our continued partnership. That's the extent of our comments on Elliott's position in PayPal. And now I'd like to turn it over to the operator to hear your questions on other areas of our business. Thanks very much, and operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Lots to digest here, and Gabs, congrats on the elevated role of Treasurer. I think for Dan just to kick it off, the Q&A, I wanted to hear how you're prioritizing executing the strategy you mentioned with lots going on here, right, with filling some key roles, you've got Elliott. As you just mentioned, you've got cost-cutting plan, capital allocation consideration. So what part of the strategy, as we've heard it, do you think of as nonnegotiable, right, in the short and the long term. That was the key question I had, but also what moves down in priority? I didn't hear about things like in-store and others. So would you mind commenting on that? Daniel Schulman : Yes, it's a great question. So we're executing on the game plan that we started laying out at the beginning of the year. We knew we had a lot to get done. And we knew we had to, one, narrow our focus on growth opportunities in which we had high conviction of their ability to make an impact. Does it -- make no mistake, we are in the business of strengthening our value proposition, growing going forward and gaining share. That is our #1 priority.  And we know the 3 things that we really need to invest in there, and there's no debate around that whatsoever. It is Checkout because that is the bread and butter of our business. We have a lot of advantages there. We continue to gain share, but there are a lot of places where we can make incremental improvements and, in some cases, some pretty radical improvements to improve our value proposition and competitive position.  Number 2 is in our digital wallets. Both Venmo and PayPal, we are seeing very encouraging green shoots. We've talked about some of those. I'll probably talk about more of it in future questions, I'm sure. But that is the future. Digital wallets are the future, a combination of both payments and commerce and financial services coming together. And we are seeing some really -- some quite a bit of adoption, quite a bit of churn reduction for those who come in. So we'll continue to invest there. And finally, Braintree. My hat goes off to that Braintree team. They have done some Herculean tasks this year. We have tremendous momentum in our full stack processing in the marketplace. As I mentioned, there is a flight to quality in the market. We are clearly seeing that. And that platform, we're just going to continue to invest in, both on the pay-in side and the payout side on things like orchestration and a multi-PSP environment.  And so those are the 3 areas that we are going to double down on and they're nonnegotiable. We are, by the way, pulling back on other areas like you mentioned because if you're going to narrow your focus by definition, there are places where you're pulling back. For instance, we were going to focus on invest this year, like stock trading and that kind of thing. We're not going to do that. We have reallocated those headcount into checkout. We've also been able to reduce headcount. We don't have the same regulatory footprint that we thought we might have.  In store, we're really moving into card as opposed to a focus exclusively on QR. That is kind of where the market is right now. It is much more impactful for us and much less expensive as we go into card being off-line tied fully into the app in a fully integrated way. And so you've got certain things long-tail international that we're just going to have cross-border come on that. We're not going to go into those domestically because they've got high beta and cost a lot, and it just takes a lot of time and effort to go and do those things.  So we are focused on the things we think will make the largest impact. We see the impact of that already. I'm quite pleased with our ability to consistently take share. We saw that, I think, accelerate in this quarter and do all of that while being efficient and productive. And those are things that we started quite a bit. We're making really good progress and they are beginning to show up in our results. And I think as Gab mentioned and I mentioned, by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we'll start to see operating margin expansion. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Look, we had expected some cost saves, and it makes sense, just given the growth of expense lines over the last couple of years. But the magnitude you're talking about is definitely more than we anticipated. So if you can just touch on how we should think about the sources of the expense saves. Maybe, if any, will be reinvested into areas versus pass through to the bottom line, and really what we can expect in terms of investment levels into the wallet and Checkout and kind of operating leverage this would be to. Daniel Schulman : Yes, I'll start and then maybe Gabs will jump in. So first of all, we're a growth business. And for us to continue to improve our value proposition, we need to invest and we need to invest in those areas that I've just mentioned to the last question. It's in checkout and our digital wallets and our Braintree platform. And we are doing increased investments this year around that. But we're doing that while being quite aggressive and focused on where do we have costs and how can we start to take those out? One is focus, as I mentioned. We're like -- we're not -- we were doing 100 things. We're now doing 3 or 4 things extremely well. There are some things, obviously, but we are really focused. And all those other things are being applied to those key focus areas.  Number two, we have a tremendous amount of scale coming out of the pandemic. We're going to do somewhere around $1.4 trillion of TPV this year. Our transactions are at $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 16%, up 20% ex eBay. And so the amount of volume we have in the business has and now has been leveraged across all of our suppliers. The more volume, the better your unit costs are. We've renegotiated our contracts across many of our suppliers, and that is giving us both OpEx savings and transaction unit cost savings in our transaction expenses as well.  And then, of course, you can always drive more and more productivity. We put on quite a number of headcount. As Gabs mentioned a year ago, our OpEx grew by 27%. We have plenty of heads. We can be more productive. In fact, our headcount is lower than when we started the year, both in our contingent workforce and our full-time workforce. But we are doing that by reallocating resources, investing in some places, taking away from others. We are driving a better product experience so we have less calls coming into servicing. Therefore, we need less people. Those are the good ways of achieving productivity.  And of course, we're looking at low-cost geos to do incremental hiring in and rationalizing things like our footprint, looking at our consulting spend. And we're cutting all of that back as we focus. And so we feel really comfortable with the investments that we're putting in. It's really important that we continue to invest in the business. But at the same time, be able to take out a tremendous amount of cost to be quite efficient. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes. Maybe I would just add, in terms of the $900 million of identified savings this year and the $1.3 billion next year, nearly 50% of that really comes from transaction-related expenses. And as Dan mentioned, really sort of benefiting from the scale we have and the ecosystem. So I wouldn't think about that as cuts to the way we do business, more really benefiting from the scale that we have and the large platform that we have.  In addition, I'd say even with those savings, we would expect transaction expense to grow next year. And that's really just from the strong growth of Braintree that continues to impact our mix. And so we don't expect year-on-year for TD to come down.  The other point I would mention is some of the savings are really not an insignificant amount, as Dan mentioned, really do relate to headcount. And we recalibrated our headcount plans to really be balanced with our growth plans on the year. So some of our expectations around the top line have come in. The way we thought about growing [indiscernible] has really adjusted. And so that's an important driver of the savings as well. Daniel Schulman : Yes. Well, I don't think we'd be seeing the incremental revenue growth. I mean, we've gone from 7% in April to north of 14% in July revenue growth. A piece of that has been the eBay lapping for sure. But a part of it is just taking share of the sales pipeline from our Braintree, implementing that live to site and slow-but-sure incremental improvements in checkout. That has to happen and needs to be a balance between cost cutting and investment. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. A follow-up on Darrin's question related to the expense and margin side of things. Just maybe taking a longer-term view, how should investors think about the margin trajectory of PayPal, given that you've got Braintree growing so well, but the implication being it's mixing in as a lower gross margin business. So just looking out kind of beyond this immediate $900 million, $1.3 billion, but sort of more conceptually or structurally over the long term, how do you think about navigating that kind of mix-related gross margin pressure and then operating margin potential for the business? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Lisa. So I think as a starting point, I mentioned, sure, on the Braintree side, yes, mix is important. And certainly, there is a different profitability sort of dynamic to Braintree. At the same time, I would mention that, that really is limited to the LE side of Braintree. And to the extent that we continue to grow our Braintree franchise in the SMB space. And to the extent we continue to grow it in Europe, really, the profitability characteristics of it are quite attractive and will continue to support the business. But in addition to that, we do have a long track record of profitable growth. And so as both Dan and I have mentioned, we do expect to begin showing operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. If we think about next year, a little early right now to provide full guidance on the year. But to start right now, we're targeting at least 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. And importantly, sort of initiatives that Dan has mentioned and the efficiencies that we're realizing the work that we're doing will allow us to grow profitably and sustainably improve the margin profile over time. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to ask a little bit about Venmo. I saw the overall volume there grew 6%. I think it slowed a bit against an easier comparison. So just curious how it came in versus your expectations. Maybe what we should expect for the second half there? It sounds like the Venmo revenue growth was robust again, so I'm assuming you're still on track for the 50% revenue growth in Venmo for this year. But just curious to get your take on what's happening with volume growth. Daniel Schulman : Jason, thanks for the question. So look, there's a lot to be excited about at Venmo right now. It's closing in on 90 million active accounts. It's going to do something like $0.25 trillion of TPV this year. And when you have that kind of scale, clearly, things begin to slow down a little bit.  As you mentioned, revenue is up 54% in the first half. We had -- we're doing $100 million revenue months now. And a host of initiatives, I'll touch on in a second. But on the TPV side specifically, it's still tough comps. I mean, we grew 58% TPV in Q2 of last year. I mean, I wouldn't say that's easing comps. It's still pretty tough comps. So on top of, obviously, you're ending stimulus, you got reopening, macroeconomic conditions, et cetera.  But there are a lot of things that we can do to improve the value proposition around P2P and around increasing TPV there. And the team is working on that, on a complete refresh of the app, which really will focus around like, search improvements, syncing up with contacts, persistent send and receive buttons no matter where you are in the app. So there are things we can do, I think, to help improve the accessibility and the ease of use of P2P in Venmo, but it's still going right now from strength to strength.  It's commerce volumes, which really Pay with Venmo goods and services and business profiles, as I mentioned, are up 250% year-over-year. These guys are working on a debit card reboot, which will be kind of like metal form factor, full app integration, rewards integration, teen accounts, which opens up the addressable market anywhere between 20 million and 30 million TAM that opens up with that. You have charities start to come on to the -- their profiles, which will encourage giving before the holiday season there.  So I'm pretty pleased with what they're doing. We're also looking at things like PayPal, Venmo, P2P interoperability, which I think is a very big opportunity. Networks, the bigger they are, the more valuable they are and the ability to start to link to PayPal and Venmo P2P interoperability, I think, is a big opportunity as well. So a lot to think about, a lot to look forward to, obviously, including Pay with Venmo on Amazon. So more to come but they're working on a ton of things right now. Operator : Our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Congratulations, Gabrielle. Good to see the accelerating 12% growth in transaction per account in Q2, which is actually your highest in at least the last 6 quarters. So what do you see as the key proof points that this higher growth rate in customer engagement is sustainable? And are you on track to increase ARPA this year enough to support your new 2022 revenue guidance? Daniel Schulman : Yes. Well, first of all, I think on the revenue guide, as Gab talked about in her remarks, I mean, our guide for Q3 normalized is about 14% if you removed the sale of the PPP onetime thing we did last year. So just this quarter, we're going to -- and then the jump-off into fourth quarter is basically flat to hit the guidance that we put out there, and July came in north of 14%.  So I think we're feeling as good as you can be in an environment that is unpredictable and anything can happen. But we're feeling really good about the revenue guidance that we gave. In terms of the engagement in TPA, I think you're going to continue to see TPA increase as the year unfolds. And you can hold me to that next quarter.  But some of the proof points are, if you look at people who are in the digital wallet and we now have over 50% of our base in our digital wallet. They've got 2x higher the ARPA than those not in the digital wallet. They do 25% more checkout. Churn is now -- our best view of it now is churn is reduced by 33%. We thought that was about 25% last quarter so that's gotten slightly better. And they do 2x the transactions per active for those who aren't in the wallet.  And so one, the more we can enhance and move people to the digital wallet, the more engagement and TPA growth we'll have. The other thing is we actually have a lot room to improve in terms of just usage of PayPal. If you look at the Fed came out with how many financial transactions does a typical consumer do in a year? And it's a little over 800. About 25% of those are online, so about 200 of those are online transactions. We only capture about 25% of those. And so there's a huge opportunity as more and more moves online, as we expand the digital wallet, as people see all they can do with that.  We just launched our high-yield savings at 1.65% interest rate. That's about 16x the national average. We're putting on thousands of people a day on to that. There's a lot we can do as we look forward. And I think the more we can put on to the digital wallet and the more compelling those services can be, the more you'll see TPA and ARPA grow. And we'll see it as we go through the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Rayna Kumar : Congratulations, Gabrielle. You have a very unique strategy in Buy Now, Pay Later, so I just want to dig into that. If you can discuss the progress of Pay in 4 and Pay in 3 and how it may evolve if we were to enter a global downturn. And secondly, have you been able to get better placement as a result of your BNPL strategy? Daniel Schulman : I guess maybe I'll start. Gabs, you can jump in. Obviously, we do have a unique approach to Buy Now, Pay Later, Rayna, as you mentioned. We don't charge any merchant fees. We have no late fees to consumers. We make our money not off of the Buy Now, Pay Later but the halo impact, which is about a 21% halo impact when somebody uses Buy Now, Pay Later. And so we aren't dependent on those revenue streams. And the profit pool for us in Buy Now, Pay Later is not inherent within Buy Now, Pay Later, but in Checkout and in our take rates. That gives us a tremendous advantage as we look at different credit cycles. We can tighten up quite easily where we need to on that. We also know, 90% of the people that apply for Buy Now, Pay Later. That is a tremendous advantage for us. We know their history. We know how they've paid. So we have amongst, if not, the highest approval rates in the Buy Now, Pay Later, and at the same time, amongst, if not, the lowest loss rates as well.  And so -- and we also -- we've been in this business for 15 years or so in the credit business. We've gone through cycles. We have people who understand this inside and out. And so I think we have a huge amount of advantages. We continue to leverage it.  And your last question is are we seeing incremental share gain when we have Buy Now, Pay Later? Clearly, we now have, with our 200,000 merchants, where we now are up on product pages. That is tremendous share gain for us and placement where, in many cases, it never even gets to the checkout page. It's just done right. The Checkout is done right off the product. page. And so as we continue to grow that and as again, there's a flight to quality in the market as well, and we have such a kind of robust value proposition, we continue to see more and more merchants place us upstream in their checkout. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : I'd also just add, we're continuing to see better upstream presentment in part because of how we're continuing to grow the product characteristics. So introducing longer duration, more options with monthly payments gives merchants more ways to allow their consumers to spend. And so that also helps drive that upstream presentment. It's been a really great product for us. We continue to see very strong performance, very low loss rates as well. Daniel Schulman : And you saw that over 100 million times used by 22 million consumers. That shows the value that consumers see in it. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : I'd also add as we think about potentially an environment where we can see some contraction in the economy, the new late fee dynamic to what we do is just exceptionally consumer-friendly. So we don't charge transaction fees for consumers on Pay in 4, Pay in 3, no interest fees, no late fees. And so overall, it's an incredibly attractive product for our customers. Rayna Kumar : Very helpful. Operator : And we have time for one last question, and that will come from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : It was encouraging to hear about the share gains within Branded Checkout. I was wondering if you could just explore that a little bit more and talk about where you see e-commerce industry growth right now and how core PayPal is performing relative to that. And Dan, you teased some potential radical improvements at Checkout. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and initiatives that the core PayPal branded checkout is pursuing to improve or maintain share. Daniel Schulman : Yes, sure. First of all on e-commerce growth rates. It's tricky and people have different opinions on it. As best we can tell, in the second quarter, e-commerce growth was relatively flat. If you take out travel out of that, it might have actually been slightly down, probably negative if you remove travel from it. And if you look at our Branded Checkout, which is sort of ex eBay, P2P and Venmo, we had positive growth and we likely gained a bit of share, if not a little bit, more than a little bit of share on that. We obviously want to continue to do better on that. And as we come into this quarter in July, we're beginning to see that turn in Branded Checkout is actually growing again, which is obviously also really helpful as we look at margin dynamics and that kind of thing as well.  For the full year, people were talking about 10% early on. That has kind of dropped into about the 8% for the full year. It's kind of where we're hearing as we look at a number of estimates out there. But BofA is down at 5% for the year. JPM is at 7% for the year. All of them accelerating in the back half, by the way. But it's still a little hazy, Mike, honestly, to understand what normalized e-commerce will look like.  We clearly did not see the bump-up of 5 years that everybody had seen during the pandemic. But we are along the traditional historic e-commerce penetration rates and I'd expect that to continue but we'll see how that normalizes. But we'll continue to expect to grow significantly faster than the rate of e-commerce going forward, both on branded by the way and unbranded as well.  And just really quickly on the Checkout side of this. I mentioned this on our last call. There are certain ways that we want to modernize the merchant experience. There's kind of the basics of this because checkout and payments are a hard business. They're like the lifeblood of a merchant. Scale matters, trust matters. Reliability is crucial on that. Conversion rates are crucial like, for instance, the average conversion rate for a merchant outside of PayPal is between 50% and 60%. For PayPal, it's between 80% and 90%. So we've got big advantages but there are also a lot of things we can do better.  Latency is one of them. Our goal is to get to 3 seconds of latency. We've already cut, this year alone, 5 seconds out of our latency. That's huge when every second really matters. The other thing that we're really focused on is removing clicks and scrolls. Right now, too often, clicked on PayPal, especially in a mobile and you go into a pop-up window. It takes you out of context and then back into the merchant app.  We are just rolling out a beta on a new mobile SDK and API that offers a consistent user experience across form factors and gives full control to a merchant of their native app. So no bouncing out, eliminating friction, increasing speed and for consumers who are using it, it's fast, simple, there are no redirects. You can sign up, log in, stay vaulted, change get rewards, use rewards all inside the merchant app, all native.  And for merchants, it's sort of a minimal integration. It's lightweight, and it improves, obviously, conversion and card abandonment. We're just putting that out into the market and into a beta, into our small businesses. We are working with larger businesses to do that later this year. But that -- we've got a lot of legacy checkout out there, making something simple and easy to integrate and lightweight that offers sort of like a no-password account for consumers, 1-click checkout across our network that can be extremely powerful. And we are beginning to deliver on that as we speak into the market. It will take time for it to roll out through the base, but I'm really pleased with what the team is putting out there right now. Michael Ng : Great. That was very helpful. Daniel Schulman : Okay. I'm glad, Mike. Well, operator, that's going to be the end of the call. I do want to thank everybody for the great questions, for your time, and we obviously look forward to speaking to all of you again soon. Thanks again. Bye, bye.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter 2022. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over and introduce your host, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Briana. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2022. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our preliminary framework for 2023 and comments related to anticipated cost savings, operating margin and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, November 3, 2022. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased to share that our results in the third quarter exceeded the guidance that we announced in August, marking the third consecutive quarter of delivering on our non-GAAP guidance. Before reviewing our results and operational progress, I want to share two exciting developments that we believe will enhance our long-term strategic position. First, I'm very pleased to announce that we are working with Apple to enhance our offerings for PayPal and Venmo merchants and consumers. Leveraging Apple's Tap to pay on iPhone functionality, merchant customers in the U.S. will soon be able to accept contactless debit or credit cards and mobile wallets including Apple Pay using an iPhone and the PayPal or Venmo iOS app. This will allow PayPal's merchant base to easily use their iPhone as a mobile point of sale without the need for a dongle or other payment terminals. We believe that this along with our other in-store initiatives will continue to accelerate our opportunity to seamlessly process payments in the physical world for our merchants. We are also adding Apple Pay as a payment option in our unbranded checkout flows on our merchant platforms, including our PayPal Commerce Platform. We are already in beta with several ecommerce platforms and merchants and anticipate a broader rollout in the coming months. And next year, U.S. customers will be able to add their PayPal and Venmo network-branded credit and debit cards to their Apple wallet and use them online and in-store wherever Apple Pay is accepted. We anticipate this to be available in the first half of 2023 expanding the opportunity for our consumers to transact in-store. This is a significant step forward in our relationship with Apple and we are excited to work closely with them to bring these new capabilities to our mutual customers. Second, I'm excited to share that we continue to ramp pay with Venmo on Amazon and we plan to be fully ramped in time for peak holiday shopping. This partnership is a reflection of Venmo scale and ubiquity, particularly in younger demographics. And we look forward to working closely with Amazon on this new offering to drive results. These relationships are aligned with our practice of working collaboratively with the major players across technology, and financial services to provide more choice and superior experiences to our mutual customers. We are regarded by many as a partner of choice due to our scale and ubiquity, enabling us to create unique value for our customers. And while we continue to enhance our strategic position, we remain focused on the operational initiatives that we shared last quarter. Our efforts to reduce our cost structure and drive productivity gains are yielding strong results. We remain on track to drive over $900 million in cost savings across our operating and transaction expenses this year, and at least $1.3 billion in cost savings next year. This focus on efficiency, while continuing to invest in key growth areas is a high priority for us. And we now expect to grow our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 to approximately 22.5%. We further anticipate that in 2023, we will deliver at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. Let me now turn to our results. Our revenues in the third quarter were $6.85 billion up 12% FXN and 11% spot, exceeding our guidance. I'm pleased to say that eBay's migration to manage payments is behind us and will be inconsequential to our results in the fourth quarter. Normalizing for eBay's migration to manage payments, our Q3 revenues grew approximately 13% on an FX neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.08 which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. The cost containment actions we discussed on last quarter's call have slowed the growth of our year-over-year non-transaction related expenses to 4%. We now expect that non-transaction related operating expenses for Q4 will be flat to slightly negative year-over-year. And we are planning similar levels in 2023. We are pleased with this execution particularly as we are driving reinvestment in key growth areas and continue to enhance our strategic position. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 37% year-over-year and an all-time record for us on an organic basis. We added 2.9 million NNAs in Q3 and we expect to add another 3 million to 4 million NNAs in Q4. I'm also very pleased to report that our transactions per active account in the quarter grew by a record 13% to 50.1x per year. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing our progress on checkout. With 35 million active merchant accounts and nearly 400 million active consumer accounts. Our scale is like few others in the world and represents a substantial competitive advantage in a business that is driven by network effects. In addition, we have built a high level of trust with our customers that drive significant preference to use our branded marks for online transactions. We have continued to grow faster than overall ecommerce in Q3 with our total TPV up 14% FXN demonstrating the competitive differentiation and diversification of our global platform. Within our PayPal branded checkout business, we believe we held or gained share in the United States, with PayPal branded checkout volumes up 4% year-over-year. While there is not a standard proxy for ecommerce growth I'd point to Bank of America's credit and debit card volume data, which highlights 2% U.S. ecommerce growth in Q3, a full 200 basis points below our 4% branded checkout growth rate. We do expect we will continue to grow at or above the rate of ecommerce growth. However, we know there are still substantial opportunities for us to pursue. We have three major areas of focus for checkout. First, elevating and optimizing the consumer experience. Second, providing merchants with a seamless integration experience and a one stop shop for payments, and third, innovating new checkout solutions. As consumers move towards mobile shopping, we are focused on creating the simplest mobile checkout experience possible. These enhancements include allowing customers to check out without leaving the original merchant point of interaction. For example, our recently updated Mobile SDK allows merchants to provide a seamless in app checkout experience. We are also deploying the latest secure user authentication standard for our consumers enabling pass keys on all iOS devices to drive speed, simplicity, and conversion. Our latest innovation is accelerated checkout, which will provide options with a robust solution and enables one click checkout. This simplified consumer experience is achieved by leveraging vaulted credentials within our network to authenticate and approve customer purchases without the need for a password. This enables seamless guest or account checkout experiences by removing obstacles, which currently cause abandoned sessions. We are currently piloting this with several key partner platforms. And we look forward to expanding this initiative as we move through 2023 and beyond. For each segment of our Merchant base, we are implementing detailed processes, go-to-market plans and KPIs to measure our migration from legacy integrations. Moving more of our merchant base to our latest and most advanced integrations will take time. This will clearly be a multi-year initiative, but it represents a significant opportunity for us. And we are putting resources, process and discipline in place to assure our execution. We continue to see good momentum with our unbranded payment platforms. We believe we are well-positioned to help merchants orchestrate payments, leveraging our insights and machine learning to route traffic between multiple PSPs resulting in increased approval and retention rates. Braintree is a key growth area for us, and we will continue to invest to further enhance the platform. Braintree TPV grew 38% in the quarter. Our Braintree momentum is driven largely by recent merchant wins and share of wallet expansions. And we recently signed an expanded agreement with Live Nation, which establishes Braintree as their primary card processor across the globe and includes an extended marketing partnership with PayPal and Venmo at some of Live Nation's largest festivals. By now pay later continues to be a major asset to our checkout experience. When PayPal was just ranked as the best overall Buy Now, Pay Later value proposition in the United States by the Wall Street Journal. In the third quarter, we processed nearly $5 billion in volume up 157% year-over-year, with over 25 million consumers using our Buy Now, Pay Later services approximately 150 million times since launch. As a result of this robust growth, we believe we have become the largest Buy Now, Pay Later providers in the world with a unique competitive advantage derived from our two-sided network. Our upstream presentment continues to grow with over 280,000 merchants, displaying our Buy Now, Pay Later on their product pages. The size of our active account base and the years of transaction data we have on our customers provides us with an additional competitive advantage from an underwriting perspective. As of the end of Q3, our loss rates remain among the lowest in the industry with no observable deterioration to-date. Venmo continues to be a significant asset in our portfolio with much untapped potential. We have almost 90 million Venmo active accounts including 57 million monthly active accounts. Total payment volume of Venmo grew 6%, while Venmo commerce volumes grew 150% in Q3. We began to onboard charities to Venmo this quarter, which we expect will encourage more giving as we enter the holiday season. As I shared earlier, we are obviously enthusiastic about our partnership with Amazon, and look forward to working with their team. In October, we announced the launch of PayPal rewards, which unifies our Honey and PayPal rewards programs. And customers now can earn, track, save and redeem cashback rewards and merchant offers in their PayPal app. In addition, our customers can also combine the benefits of their existing card rewards and offers, allowing them to save even more. PayPal rewards is ramping in time for peak holiday shopping. And we have a robust roadmap to extend and enhance the program throughout 2023. In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are confident we have turned a corner in our transformation. We will continue to drive cost savings and streamline our processes to improve productivity, while investing to differentiate our value proposition, drive market share and deliver on our commitments. Given a challenging macro environment, slowing ecommerce trends, and an unpredictable holiday shopping season, we were being appropriately prudent in our Q4 revenue guide. At the same time, we are raising both our full year and Q4 EPS outlook and expect EPS growth in Q4 to be positive 6% to 8%. And given our commitment, and focus on driving continued operational efficiency and earnings leverage, we plan to deliver no less than 15% non-GAAP EPS growth next year. While there are a number of unknowns regarding the macro environment, we can largely control our spend, and its implication on earnings growth. Of course, we're also focused on investing for growth. And we are balancing efficient spend with continued investment to drive future top-line growth. We are excited by the operational initiatives, product enhancements and new strategic partnerships that position PayPal in a substantially stronger position from when we started the year. I want to thank the PayPal team for the work they do every day to support our merchants and consumers, live our values and drive our results. And I'm also pleased that John Kim has recently joined us as Chief Product Officer. He has deep technical and operational expertise with extensive experience overseeing product and engineering teams and has driven customer focused innovation at scale. We are fortunate to have the chance to work with him to drive this next chapter in PayPal story. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gabrielle. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us to deliver a great quarter. The strong results we're reporting today demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our teams are proving our ability to navigate a dynamic operating environment, while also staying focused on our key priorities. We once again demonstrated our results, combining execution and focus with growth in our core business. Our results reflect our operating discipline, diversification and resilience. The power of PayPal is the scale of our global franchise. Our investments in innovation are making us stronger. And we're excited by what we see as we execute against our growth opportunities. I share Dan's enthusiasm for our growing relationship with Apple and the rollout of pay with Venmo on Amazon. We believe we will continue to extend and reinforce our leadership in payments. And we are confident that our competitive positioning with unparalleled scale across our two-sided network will allow us to emerge from this period of economic uncertainty stronger. We're proud of the quarter we delivered. We surpassed the third quarter financial targets we shared with you in early August and delivered on our commitment of sequential acceleration in our revenue and earnings growth. We're also on track to build upon our operating margin performance in Q3 to deliver a non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our teams are energized by the progress we have made. And by the increased operational rigor we're bringing to running our business and investing in our priorities. At the same time, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be complex and we're focused on taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business for profitable growth at scale. This year, we will process nearly $1.4 trillion of payment volume an increase from $1.25 trillion last year, and a 25% compound annual growth rate from $288 billion in 2015. At this massive scale, we are not immune to macro headwinds. As we close out 2022 and prepare for the year ahead, we're intensely focused on doing everything within our control to anticipate and mitigate ongoing macro risks and drive robust earnings growth. Given the breadth of our two sided platform, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we believe we are well positioned and have the levers available to successfully navigate an economic cycle. We remain committed to meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023, and a significantly stronger non-GAAP earnings growth profile. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our third quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 12.4% on a currency neutral basis, and 10.7% at spot to $6.85 billion. With each of these metrics exceeding our guidance. To dramatically strengthening dollar has been an increasing headwind as we move through the year, and we expect this condition to persist in the fourth quarter. Transaction revenue grew 11.2% to $6.23 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue grew 6.4% to $612 million. This performance relative to last year resulted from higher interest income on customer store balances, offset by lower credit revenue as we [levied] [ph] higher than normal loan servicing fees. In the third quarter U.S. revenue grew 14.4%, while international revenue increased 6% at spot. On a currency neutral basis International revenue increased 9.4% and excluding eBay 11.7%. Additionally, eBay marketplaces revenue declined 38% to $145 million and represented 2% of our total revenue. Our take rate performance was very strong with both transaction and total take rate improving approximately four basis points. Transaction take rate was 1.85% and total take rate was 2.03%. Both transaction and total take rate benefited from gains from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue as well as Venmo monetization. Interest income also benefited our total take rate. Transaction expense came in at 89 basis points at the rate of TPV relative to 83 basis points at a rate last year. This result was largely driven by the increase in the contribution of Braintree volume, which are predominantly card funded to our overall mix of payment volume. To a lesser extent funding mix also contributed to higher transaction expenses from more normalized debit card usage relative to 2021. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points versus 9 basis points in Q3 last year. In addition, credit losses were $113 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2021, we released $63 million of credit reserves, which benefited transaction margin and operating margin performance in the prior period by 100 basis points. We ended Q3 with $6.5 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 4%. The growth in global pay later receivables was the largest driver of loan origination. The mix of shorter duration originations from our pay later products and strong performance of our loan receivables portfolio resulted in a reserve coverage ratio of 7.4% compared to 7.3% last quarter, and 11.6% in third quarter last year. Transaction margin dollars was 4%, a reversal from year-over-year declines in the first and second quarter of 2022. Excluding the benefit from the reserve released last year transaction margin dollars increased 6%. This quarter, we began seeing benefits to our transaction expense from leveraging our scale across the network ecosystem. We expect this trend to continue in Q4 and into 2023. In addition, we're making progress in rationalizing non-transaction related expense growth. In the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, these expenses grew 4% year-over-year relative to 17% growth last year, driving 180 basis points of operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating income also grew 4% year-over-year to $1.53 billion. Importantly, this is the first quarter since Q2 '21, in which we delivered operating income growth. Our operating margin was 22.4% which was approximately two points better than our outlook provided at Q2 earnings. We are particularly pleased by this operating margin outperformance and look forward to building on this track record of cost prudence as we enter 2023 and beyond. For the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.08 nearly 15% stronger than our outlook. Pre-tax benefits in Q3 '21 of approximately $0.10 per share created a headwind to EPS growth. Our outperformance relative to our expectations was predominantly driven by the actions we took to increase efficiencies within non-transaction related operating expenses and improved transaction loss performance. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.1 billion. During the quarter we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $4.1 billion. Relative to last year, Q3 free cash flow grew 37%. We consider our balance sheet and cash flow to be competitive differentiators, which provide us with significant optionality for value creation. In the third quarter, we completed an additional $939 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have now returned $3.2 billion to shareholders representing 78% of the free cash flow we have generated. Given our conviction in our business relative to its valuation today, and its long-term competitive advantages and ability to deliver sustainable value creation, we have taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program this year. We believe that share repurchase remains an optimal use of capital for our shareholders, while allowing us to retain the flexibility to continue investing opportunistically in our business. We now expect to complete an additional $1 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. As I discussed during our earnings call last quarter, we've been assessing opportunities for additional credit externalization. We have made progress on this initiative and are committed to secure an off-balance sheet funding for a portion of our global pay later portfolio next year. Before I cover our guidance, I'd like to discuss the incremental disclosure that we are sharing this quarter to disaggregate our TPV. In our investor update, we're providing additional information related to our volume mix, and how it has evolved over time. We believe sharing this detail is helpful for investors to better understand our business trends. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, and our preliminary thoughts for 2023. First, some context on the trends we're seeing and how these are shaping our outlook. As Dan mentioned, overall, we saw U.S. ecommerce growing in the low single digits in Q3 with deceleration into the close of the quarter. This trend persisted in October on our platform as well as in third party data, we have not seen the early start to the U.S. online holiday season that we saw in 2021. Our guidance contemplates holiday ecommerce ramping through November. Overall, our expectations for holiday ecommerce are consistent with the recent spending forecasts from Adobe, MasterCard and Salesforce with growth in the low single digits. We are also closely monitoring channel mix between in-store and online as well as the mix of services and good spending. From a market perspective the U.S. continues to outperform international and we are seeing weaker performance in the U.K., our second largest market. These factors combined with a broader macro trends have been incorporated into our revised outlook. We are lowering our full year currency neutral revenue expectations by 1-point and at the midpoint raising our non-GAAP EPS expectations by $0.16. Given the current uncertainty in the global macro environment, we believe this is an appropriately sensible and prudent approach to our revenue outlook. That said, our earnings guidance reflects the resilience and power of our franchise. In raising our EPS outlook again, we're demonstrating our control over operating expenses, the diversification of our business and the benefits from scale to our operating model. We believe that our ability to raise our earnings guidance in this environment is especially distinguishing relative to other public company guidance we've seen for Q4. For the full year, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 10% on a currency neutral basis, and approximately 8.5% at spots. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency neutral basis, and approximately 7% at spot. We believe our Q4 and full year revenue growth guidance is strong given our scale and the macro backdrop. We also expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin of at least 21% this year. For the first three quarters of 2022, our operating margin has declined year-over-year. Importantly in the fourth quarter, we expect this trend to inflect and to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion. Our guidance contemplates Q4 operating margin of approximately 22.5%. In addition, we're raising non-GAAP EPS to $4.07 to $4.09 for the year. As we noted entering the year, discrete tax benefits and reserve releases last year in the aggregate benefited 2021 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.54 and are a headwind to our EPS growth profile this year. Based on our expectations for revenue and operating margin in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.18 to $1.20. We expect to finish 2022 in a stronger position than we started it, with greater operating discipline and focus. Dan and I are pleased with our improving execution and we're confident there'll be room for continued improvement. However, with our most important weeks in the holiday season ahead of us, as well as ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe it is too early to provide a detailed outlook for 2023 on this call. That said, as we're planning for the year ahead, our framework currently includes the following assumptions. First, that our overall volumes will continue to grow faster than ecommerce across our core markets, and that we will continue to take market share. At the same time, we expect inflationary pressures, alongside slowing global growth to weigh on discretionary ecommerce spending, which could continue to be pressured in 2023. Second, that we will deliver at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion next year an improvement from our 50-basis point commitment when we report our results last quarter. And third, our commitment to drive solid growth and earnings per share. Taken together, we believe that our cost savings initiatives and benefits from higher interest rates will enable us to deliver non-GAAP earnings growth of at least 15% next year. We believe this outlook for next year contemplate a sufficiently wide range of revenue outcome. We are firmly committed to executing on the operational initiatives we discussed last quarter and are highly confident that we will deliver on our 2023 framework. Finally, from a capital allocation standpoint, we plan to take a similarly aggressive approach to share repurchases in 2023 as we have this year. In closing, despite the many challenges of today's environment, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate the road ahead. We cannot have more confidence in our people and in the priorities we're executing against. We are just beginning to scale several of our newer consumer and merchant experiences and work with several important strategic partners in the ecosystem. For our shareholders, we continue to achieve significant growth while returning capital in the form of share repurchases. And we're confident that our earnings power and strong free cash flow generation will allow us to continue to invest in our business and extend our leadership position. We are completely focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders and look forward to updating you on our progress. With that I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions. Brianna, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Fossett : Great, thanks. Exciting announcements for sure with Apple, et cetera. Just wondering, on the margins, though, can you talk a little bit about how you're approaching next year, obviously, there's -- as you indicated, Gabrielle, there's a big range of potential scenarios, especially around revenue, but you seem fairly confident in your ability to deliver that 100 basis points of margin expansion, which is a little more than we had modeled. So you can talk about, like, what's going into that, like, what levers you can pull to make sure you can deliver that and how that translates into that 15% EPS growth. Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Hey, James. It\u2019s Dan. I will start off and then maybe Gabs can fill in around the edges here. First of all, we do feel quite confident in our ability to raise our EPS for the year. And then on top of that higher total, generated at least 15%, EPS growth, which gets you to about as a first step for us $4.70 next year. And this is really being driven by being taken very prudent approach to what could happen next year, from a macroeconomic perspective, there are a wide range of scenarios on that, and everybody has an opinion. But we think it's prudent to plan for a difficult economic cycle and have our cost structure, be in line with that, so that we can deliver robust EPS growth. Our cost and productivity initiatives are so well underway. I'm really pleased with the execution that we've had over the last several quarters. We've been anticipating a difficult economic environment, the team's taken a lot of action across non-transaction related OpEx. As we said, in our remarks, we expect in the fourth quarter, that's going to be flat, and probably slightly negative, as we look ahead, and then as you look into 2023, we see no reason why it will come off of those levels of being flat, to slightly negative. If you think about it, our non-transaction OpEx has traditionally been in the mid-single digits for a long time, during the pandemic that jumped up to 17% in 2020, and about 20% in 2021. So we have plenty of headcount, our headcount are going to be down at the end of this year from where we started at the beginning. We have a lot of efficiencies, as our processes get better and better. We are clearly leveraging our scale with our suppliers as well as whether it be our network partners, or others on transaction related expenses. And we feel very good about delivering at least 100 basis points of operating margin improvement next year. By the way, at the same time, investing in our high growth, high conviction areas, checkout digital wallets and Braintree. We think this is a time where market share leaders get stronger. We want to take advantage of this environment that we're in. We are already seeing some of the investments we're making in those areas, pay real dividends and our ability to satisfy our customers. And we think this is an opportunity for us to take share going forward. We're in a rising interest rate environment, that's a tailwind for us for many of our competitors, it's a headwind on and we just think there's opportunities for us to operate more efficiently and effectively and invest and continue to take market share. So really pleased with the focus and the commitment from the team making real progress on the cost side and the productivity front. And we'll continue to do so as we go into next year. Next question operator. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, guys. I wanted to talk about the top-line outlook for Q4 currency neutral. We're looking at 9% revenue growth. I know last quarter, we were thinking more like 14%, obviously linked to the software TPV outlook. Can you just walk us through perhaps pieces of that bridge? What you thought that last quarter versus what you're thinking now for Q4, given the context of the softer macro? Thank you. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes. You bet, Jason. So you're right. We took down our full year revenue guidance by about a point and at the same time, of course, raised our EPS at the midpoint by $0.16. We had a strong Q3, and obviously, we delivered on all of our commitments. But at the end of the quarter, we started to see some slowing and that came right at the at the very end. In October, in addition, we didn't see the early start to the holiday season that we've seen in 2021. And so we brought down our internal forecast for U.S. ecommerce growth, commensurately with that. And so, in the middle of the year, we were thinking about U.S. ecommerce growth for the fourth quarter and the mid-single digits, that's now come down to low singles. That's pretty consistent with what we see from other third parties. And that really is the predominant driver of the change in our guidance. Now, in conjunction with that similar to earlier this year, when we took down some of our expectations around initiatives in conjunction with a lower growth environment, we've done the same. And so that's also contributing to the 9% FX neutral expectation on Q4. But of course, we're raising EPS overall. And in the quarter, we expect to deliver about 75 basis point of Op margin expansion. So we continue to deliver on our efficiencies, despite the slower growth environment. Daniel Schulman : I think you'll also be seeing any report that comes out on the macroeconomic environment, reaching all times high. The inflation report in the Euro Zone was not great. And you're seeing in countries like the Netherlands, which is so conservative, a 17% inflation rate, U.K., which is our second largest market, is really suffering. And our view is that we're still going into winter, energy costs are going to go up. And the low-end income levels and middle-income levels are beginning to cut back on their discretionary spend, they're spending so much more on food, on energy, on gas, on rent. And we're beginning to see that impact those segments of the market. The high end of the market, by the way, still spending quite freely. And we're seeing that also in our results. The other thing is, we did expect quite a number of live to site implementations on Braintree in the fourth quarter, almost a full point of growth that are being pushed into next year. So we'll capture that revenue, we just won't capture it this quarter. So I think as Gab said, there's certain things we can control, that is our expenses, where we're investing, how we're doing in those investments. And there, I think the team is doing an excellent job. And there's certain things like the macro environment that we can't control. But we need to be ready in a wide range of scenarios. And that's what we're laying out for you, firm commitment around at least 15%, EPS growth and operating margin expansion and continued investment in our high growth, high conviction areas. Jason Kupferberg : All makes sense. Thanks, guys. Daniel Schulman : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian : Thanks very much. Obviously, it's a fluid environment. But maybe following up the last question, I think it'd be helpful to know for context, how you're thinking about the overall ecommerce environment into next year. How that impacts the 2023 framework and including the underlying volume, the revenue growth assumptions that you have to get to those targets. Thank you. Daniel Schulman : So let me start off and Gabs can come in. So first of all, Colin, I think it's a little bit too soon to have strong visibility into what 2023 will look like. Typically in a quarter, when you're a third of the way through it, you have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen in the quarter. But in the fourth quarter, that's not the case. It's really all about the holiday season. And what happens in five- or six-week, period, that's still ahead of us. But based on what we're seeing right now, based on external reports, based on our conversations with other ecommerce players you saw, another very large ecommerce player take down their revenues in the fourth quarter that we think that ecommerce is going to be pretty muted in the fourth quarter. And right now, we are not planning that that comes back for any reason, as we look into 2023. I think baseline ecommerce growth will be subdued. But I fully expect that we will outpace it. We've got quite a number of Braintree live to site with very large merchants coming up. Our checkout and digital wallet improvements are quite strong right now. And I'm really pleased with the indications from those initiatives. Obviously, Amazon, we'll see what happens with that but we have a lot of hope for that. And our deal with Apple will certainly be meaningful over at least the medium term on that. So still too early to call, we're going to be very conservative on our top-line assumptions, but we're going to build a ton of resilience into our model. We will adjust to potential lower growth environments, we can keep our OpEx very well controlled. We've demonstrated that now and will continue to enable operating margin expansion next year so. And if the macro picture gets better, these numbers can improve dramatically, but we're anticipating a difficult economic cycle and preparing for that so that we can invest and deliver robust EPS growth at the same time. Colin Sebastian : Thank you very much. Daniel Schulman : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Darrin Peller : Hey, thanks, guys. Look, it's really helpful to have the volume breakdown by PayPal Braintree more, I know you said I think you said 4% core PayPal growth. And you're saying you're expecting that it'll be in line with the market. If you could just touch on the assumptions and drivers of PayPal core engagement growth and what you can do there. It obviously looks like you're making progress around initiatives like passkey or the Venmo, Amazon partnership or obviously Apple. All that should help I assume on the checkout experience, but maybe we can have some more color on how much room there is to improve that experience and what that can mean. Daniel Schulman : Yes, sure. So, I will dive really quickly into both checkout and a little bit on what we're seeing on digital wallet. So as you know, Dan, we're already the leader in branded checkout, I mean, we have 8x the footprint of the next closest digital wallet. Consumers are twice as likely to spend online when they see the PayPal button, 80% of the 1500 largest online retail retailers across the U.S. in Europe, except us in our [half rate] [ph] right now is 600 basis points above the market average like for every 100 transactions, PayPal is going to approve six more than traditional card networks. But obviously, as we've talked about many times, we can do a lot more here and one, we've improved customer perceived latency by 40%. In the last 12 months, our uptime and availability has gone up by another nine, we are approaching five nines of availability. And when we're doing in -- our early indications from in app with the Mobile SDK, is that conversion rates increase between 3% and 10%. Again, it's early days on that but imagine how significant that improvement is. On the authentication side, passkeys is a very big deal. Passkeys are going to be accepted. Not just with Apple, we're integrating through iOS on passkeys initially. But Google and Microsoft are also enabling passkeys. And that basically enables authentication through biometrics fully embedded into the OS, it eliminates the need for like weak or reused credentials. It removes the frustration of having to remember, password. And like one of our recent surveys, like 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase due to a password issue. So that passkey could be a very meaningful piece of conversion uplift for us. And then of course, we're moving into [voting] [ph] and accelerated checkout. And I've mentioned this already on our digital wallet stats, but it's up 50% of our base now plus is using our digital wallets that's up over 13% year-over-year, we're seeing much reduced churn on that 25% to 33%, 50% greater ARPU, 60% more checkout transactions, we're seeing a lot of our new products in the wallet gained a lot of traction. I mean, savings is early, it's got a 3% APY. But we're seeing a 20% lift in ARPA for those come into our savings program, 30% lift in checkout. And even things like just like our new three-two card, because cards are important part of our strategy, that's off to an incredibly strong start. We've acquired more accounts in the first six months of that launch, than we did in the previous 22 months with our 2% cashback offer. So a lot of things to be excited about in terms of what we can do with our initiatives. And that's why we're investing heavily in them, as well as returning operating margin performance and EPS performance to our investors. Darrin Peller : Understood. Thanks, Dan. Daniel Schulman : Yep. You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Good to hear your voices. Dan, I just wanted to follow up on the Apple-related announcements that you made or highlighted on the call, certainly some good progress there. Can you talk a bit more about what you think that unlocks for PayPal in terms of better serving both your merchants and your consumers? Are there any aspects of this relationship that you could think could be more impactful perhaps over time, like where could it go? And then also could talk a little bit about how that relationship dynamic is? How collaborative this relationship is with Apple? Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yes. Well, first of all, I think the agreement is quite important, strategically, and our two companies have been working on that together for quite some time. I think there are three areas that this really helps to unlock. I mean, first of all, enabling our merchants to use their iPhone without any incremental dongle or point of sale terminal around that all they need to do if they have a business profile on Venmo, or PayPal has given us three pieces of information, their mobile phone number, their birth date, and either their social security number or their tax ID, that's it, and then they're set up to receive payments in the offline world. And our payment rate there is 2.29% plus $0.09, that is a really competitive rate versus others in the market. And we think this can be really especially significant for the millions of customers that have Venmo business profiles and allow us to compete aggressively in an omnichannel world. And so I think there's a big unlock on that. Second, adding Apple to our unbranded flows. As you know, Apple's already on Braintree in our unbranded flows, but that's just going to make us well more competitive. As we go out and sell PayPal commerce platform further down into middle market and smaller businesses. It enables us to sell PayPal commerce platform more completely it enables us to offer more choice to our merchants, which is something we've been focused on for years and years now. And it also enables the very best integration of our PayPal branded and Venmo branded checkout buttons. And then, finally, the ability for our consumers to add their PayPal and Venmo credit and debit card into Apple Pay in the U.S., for the use that anywhere Apple Pay is accepted, is probably a bigger deal than most people realize. We've been doing this with Google Pay for quite some time. And we've seen, for instance, that Google Pay users in Germany, when they add their PayPal credentials there, there's a 20% increase in their branded checkout transactions. And so they also have the ability to create temporary digital cards that can even allow us to bring our Buy Now, Pay Later from branded checkout online, to everywhere consumer shops. So I think there's a lot of really nice unlocks. Apple and PayPal. I've been working closely on this. We're both excited to put these into the market, and dedicate resources to ensuring that they're successful, and just create a better value proposition for our mutual customers. Lisa Ellis : Terrific, thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks, Dan and Gabs. Just any more clarity on the -- at least part of the 1.3 billion in cost efficiency next year is, I'm just curious if that's more likely to come from cost cutting or maybe less investing? How quickly also, can you pull the levers to deliver on the 15%? Thanks. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, you bet. So when we talked last quarter about driving at least $1.3 billion in cost savings next year, nearly half of that was coming on the transaction expense side with the other half coming from non-transaction related OpEx. I'd say in addition to thinking we can do more, I think the balance weighs more in favor of non-transactional related OpEx than it does TE at this point. And some of that's based on the fact that with a slightly lower growth environment. Some of the benefits that we derive on the TE side are really volume based in nature. And those volume expectations come in a bit, we would be driving more on the non-transactional related OpEx side. That said, I think we see a lot of room to go in terms of our initiatives there. And so just sort of taking a step back. Last year, our non-transactional related OpEx grew by 20%. That was on top of about 17% growth in 2020, over 2019. And so this year, we're spending about $2.5 billion more in our non-transaction related OpEx buckets than we did in 2019. And we see an opportunity to be a lot more productive and drive more savings there. And so you'll see this year some marketing dollars coming down that came down again in Q3 about 1%, after coming down considerably more than that, in Q2. We will end up the year with low single-digit, non-transactional related OpEx growth and I\u2019m expecting next year will do better than that. I'd expect it to be closer to flat, if not a decline year-on-year. So we're looking for the opportunities we can to continue to drive operating margin expansion even in a lower growth environment. And we think you know that the savings we're finding are really sustainable. And it's a lot more about productivity and using our scale to benefit us. And so, we think we emerge from this environment much stronger as a result of the work that we're doing. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood. Now that's all useful and thanks, got to you say thank you for Slide six, including the CAGR stuff. That's great to have. Is that a one timer and I'll jump off? Thanks, in terms of disclosure. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : We will continue to provide updates. I don't know that we're committed to doing it on a quarterly basis, but we'll continue to update on the mix of our TPV as it's quite important to understanding the performance of the business. We'll take the next question. Operator : We have time for one last question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks so much for squeezing me in. You've announced a number of new omnichannel initiatives whether it be the announcements with Apple today. The rollout recently of PayPal Zettle terminal in the U.S. and of course continue to expansion of your BNPL products. Can you help us think about what all the omnichannel initiatives might mean over time for revenue? And then, sort of broadly, what are the costs associated with expanding omnichannel? You've talked about freeing up investment dollars from your cost reduction initiatives. Thanks so much. Daniel Schulman : Yes. I'll start on that, David. So BNPL is an integral part of our checkout strategy. We know if we go into upfront presentment, Buy Now, Pay Later, somebody puts us on their product pages, as opposed to check out that our share of checkout goes up quite dramatically. And as you saw, and as you heard, from me, it's growing by leaps and bounds. We're approaching 300,000, upstream presentment. And we're one of the top players in any market two years after launch 150 million different loans. At over, by the way 2.2 million unique merchants. And what I didn't say in my script is, it drives a halo spend of greater than 20%. And 90 plus of that is incremental to us. And so not only do we have, a great value proposition, but we have a real competitive advantage in knowing our customers, 90% of the people that use Buy Now, Pay Later, we have history on. And so our loss rates remain low and stable. And today we're live in 8 markets. As I mentioned, when Lisa asked her question, we think that the ability to take Buy Now, Pay Later, anywhere you want to shop, whether that be online or in store, is a really exciting part, the evolution of Buy Now, Pay Later, as part of being able to put a branded debit or credit card, PayPal, or Venmo branded debit card into Apple Pay. We can also provision a digital, Buy Now, Pay Later, for somebody going in stores, they can pay in-store using one of our Buy Now, Pay Later solutions. And we are also now linking our card strategy, which is a very important part of our in-store. We are moving away from going heavy into QR and doing much more with cards. But imagine paying for something in store and then coming back into your PayPal app and deciding okay, I paid for that. But now I want to pay for that in four installments or split that payment with rewards or fiat currency. And so we're really trying to imagine Buy Now, Pay Later as being fully omni as a capability. And we think that will unlock quite a bit for us as we look forward. David Togut : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : I think thank you, David for that. And I want to thank everybody for the time, for your great questions. We look forward to speaking with all of you soon. And again, thanks for your time. Take care and bye-bye.

We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023, our planning assumptions for 2023 and our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rate, cost savings, operating margin and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about our about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, February 9, 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.  With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabs. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today's call. Well we obviously have a lot to cover in the next hour and I want to be sure we have plenty of time for your questions. So let me jump right into my remarks. In a difficult macroeconomic environment with the overall growth of e-commerce continuing to slow, we still managed to grow our 2022 revenues by 10% FXN to $27.5 billion. We grew our TPV by 13% FXN, with our branded checkout volumes growing in-line with global e-commerce growth. And we processed over $1.35 trillion of volume on our platform. Our non-transaction-related OpEx grew by 2.7% for the year, down from 20% growth last year as we operationalized the reduction of over $900 million in costs in both our transaction expense and non-transaction OpEx. And throughout the year, we drove 3,900 basis points of improvement in our non-GAAP EPS growth rate from negative 28% in Q1 to positive 11% in Q4. We returned $4.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, representing more than 80% of our free cash flow, which totaled $5.1 billion in 2022.  In the quarter, we set several new milestones, and we returned to operating margin expansion and positive earnings growth. For the first time in our history, we exceeded $7 billion of revenue in the quarter, meeting our guidance of 9% FXN growth with the revenues of $7.4 billion. In addition, for the first time ever, we exceeded 6 billion transactions in a quarter, resulting in 51.4 transactions per active account growing 13% year-over-year. We delivered $1.24 in non-GAAP EPS, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance, as I mentioned, growing at 11%. The quarter was clearly a positive inflection point and is a direct result of our intense focus and cost discipline and the pursuit of profitable growth. I'm particularly pleased with the team's progress to rightsize our cost structure. For the quarter, our non-transaction-related OpEx declined year-over-year by 6%, and we are exiting the year with a run rate ahead of our planned $1.3 billion of savings in 2023. We grew our non-GAAP operating margin to 22.9%, up 115 basis points from a year ago and up sequentially for the second quarter in a row. As we look towards 2023, I want to lay out our thinking about the year ahead. First, we have identified an incremental $600 million of cost savings on top of the $1.3 billion of cost savings previously identified. This includes the very difficult decision to reduce our headcount by 7% as we continue to improve our processes and sharpen our focus. We will also continue to reduce our external vendor spend and real estate footprint. We now expect that non-transaction related OpEx for the full year will decline in the high single digits year-over-year, driving approximately 125 basis points of margin expansion and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth. The second point I want to make is that we have designed our cost structure and EPS growth targets based on what we believe to be a very conservative planning assumption of mid-single-digit FXN revenue growth rate in order to give high confidence in our ability to deliver our EPS. And the third and final point is that our actual revenue expectations are well higher than that planning assumption. As you can see from our Q1 guide of 9% FXN growth with Q1 non-GAAP EPS anticipated to grow by 23% to 25% to $1.08 to $1.10. I want to emphasize another point, and that is we are confident that our 2023 cost structure enables us to continue to fully invest in our high conviction growth initiatives. We are putting significant resources behind the modernization of our checkout experience in order to defend and grow our market share in our branded checkout business. This includes a drive towards passwordless, one click native in-app experiences as well as deploying the next generation of advanced checkout using our data and AI capabilities. Although this will be a multiyear initiative and will take time given the scale of our base and our legacy integrations, I am extremely pleased with the progress we made last year.  We will continue to deliver scaled growth for Braintree. And last year, we made significant progress in modernizing our architecture and capabilities. These improvements resulted in a substantial number of new sales and incremental volume from existing accounts. In addition, we have an impressive pipeline of opportunity for 2023. In the first half of this year, we intend to fully ramp our unbranded offering to small and midsized businesses, either directly or through channel partners. The launch of PPCP, or PayPal Complete Payments, will meaningfully expand our unbranded total addressable market by as much as $750 billion, and enables us to drive incremental share with higher margins than our Braintree Enterprise service. On the consumer side, we'll continue to enhance our digital wallet value proposition. We are focused on the end-to-end customer experience, from onboarding to the entirety of the consumer life cycle, utilizing more advanced forms of AI to drive optimal consumer choices.  In the past two years, we have introduced a significant number of products and services. For instance, our Buy Now Pay Later service is driving significant lifts in checkout and incremental TPV, and it's now one of the most popular Buy Now Pay Later services in the world. With almost 200 million loans to over 30 million consumers since launching in 2020 and with approximately 300,000 merchants putting our Buy Now Pay Later upstream on their product pages. We have introduced savings, bill pay, new forms of giving, more ways to send international remittances, new debit and credit cards, rewards and customized deals and offers, all within a single app, and we are now integrating these disparate services into what we hope will be a seamless user experience that is customized across both Venmo and PayPal with the ultimate goal of driving daily usage. We need to reestablish P2P as a core anchor for PayPal and Venmo. It is a key driver of usage and often establishes the amount of balance an individual consumer holds in their wallet. The more people store in their balance, the more they use checkout and the better our overall economics. We plan to meaningfully enhance the overall P2P experience, including revamping the onboarding experience, reducing declines and introducing more value-added capabilities. I'm proud of all the team has done to responsibly innovate. We've made significant strides in upgrading our legacy infrastructure and retiring our technical debt. Eight years ago, we were primarily a monolithic C++ stack. By the end of Q1, we will have completed a full payment stack replatforming, leveraging a modern architecture and the latest software engineering methods. We had record platform availability in 2022, and we put out approximately 80,000 software releases. Our increased productivity and focused efforts are enabling us to make significant progress every quarter in upgrading our merchant base to our most advanced checkout flows. In 2021, approximately 20% of our top 100 merchants were on our latest checkout experiences. At the end of 2022, one third of our top 100 were in our latest checkout integration. And in 2023, we are targeting to be approximately 50%. And despite an increasingly competitive environment, we are confident that in total, we continue to hold share across our core markets. As we look ahead to 2023, we've built our plan to assure proper staffing of our key initiatives. But we also know that we must have a mindset of continuous productivity, not just last year, not just this year, but in the years ahead.  Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it's logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4. Longer term, the secular tailwinds that have benefited our business have not changed. And we are confident that when e-commerce growth starts to turn and grow at more historical double-digit rates, we will be extremely well positioned to capitalize on that shift and drive even higher revenue growth with increased margins. Finally, I'd like to address my plans around CEO succession. As some of you have noted, I turned 65 last month, albeit I will say, a very young 65. The board and I discussed CEO succession multiple times a year. And that informed the board that I plan to retire from serving as the President and CEO of PayPal at the end of this year.  I felt there were two important considerations in terms of timing. First, I wanted to be sure that PayPal had positive momentum and was in a position to deliver a solid year of performance. So I can be sure I wasn't leaving the company in a difficult position. And second, it was important to me that the Board have enough time to conduct a thorough search and have a reasonable transition period. In a global business as complex as PayPal, there are important relationships with government officials and regulators across the world, with the CEOs of our partners and with the CEOs of our customers, that will need to be thoughtfully transitioned. I feel that a year gives the board enough runway to find the next leader of PayPal and time for an orderly transition.  Of course, I will be flexible in my time frame in order to assure we seamlessly onboard the ideal next leader of PayPal, and I look forward to continuing to serve on the PayPal board. I'm eager to see the next CEO build on all we have accomplished in the last eight and half years and seize the immense potential ahead of us. In the meantime, I will remain fully focused on maintaining our momentum and executing on our plan. Since our IPO, PayPal's stock price has outpaced the S&P 500. And as you can see in our investor deck, our revenues, TPV, earnings and free cash flow have all tripled in size during that same time period. However, I feel confident that now is a time where our business has hit multiple positive inflection points. By the end of this year, we will have the appropriate cost structure to ensure that we deliver profitable growth with consistent and healthy non-GAAP EPS growth. And more importantly, we are confident we have the right road map in place to drive continued improvements in our customer experiences so that we remain a global leader in digital payments. In this current environment with so many of our competitors struggling to make money, we see a path to emerge from this economic downturn in a position of increased strength. We are quite encouraged as we look out at 2023 and beyond.  I want to thank all of our employees for the outstanding work and passion they display every day. We still have a lot to accomplish, but we are finally at the point where 2023 can be a transformational year for our customers and our shareholders.  Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gab. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us to deliver a solid quarter. The results we're reporting today demonstrate the strength, resilience and diversification of our business.  We accelerated earnings growth on both a year-over-year and sequential basis despite ongoing pressure on e-commerce throughout our core markets. We continue to navigate this dynamic operating environment with strong discipline and a renewed focus on our key priorities. While the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we're energized by the significant opportunity we have to advance our leadership in payments and better serve our customers. We believe this is an environment where the strong will get stronger and where our scale, profitability and stability make us a partner of choice and a formidable competitor in the payments ecosystem. Our results reflect our efforts to manage our business with greater discipline and deliver operating margin expansion. Our ongoing savings efforts are resulting in sustainable efficiencies for our business.  In addition, we're investing in our high-conviction growth initiatives to ensure that we emerge stronger from this period of economic uncertainty. We're proud of the quarter we delivered. Relative to the fourth quarter targets we shared with you in November, our non-GAAP EPS outperformed, and our revenue was in line. Importantly, the sequential improvement in our earnings growth continued. The fourth quarter was an inflection point as our non-GAAP operating margin expanded for the first time since the first quarter of 2021, marking a return to profitable growth. We have now established a solid foundation to build on these results. And in 2023, we plan to deliver meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion and a significantly stronger non-GAAP earnings profile. Before discussing our 2023 outlook, I'd like to highlight our fourth quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 9% on a currency-neutral basis and 7% at spot to $7.38 billion. This represents a three-year revenue CAGR of 14% and 19%, excluding eBay.  Transaction revenue grew 5% to $6.7 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue grew 26% to $681 million. Relative to last year, this performance resulted from higher interest income on customer store balances and positive contributions from both our merchant and consumer credit products. In the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue grew 10% and international revenue grew 2% at spot. On a currency neutral basis, international revenue grew 6%. We had solid take rate performance. Transaction take rate was 1.88%, flat to last year, and total take rate improved 3 basis points to 2.07%. eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 31%, and the take rate on these volumes decreased to 1.95% from 2.29% in Q4 2021. This was offset by a 4-basis point increase on the rest of our volume. Transaction expense came in at 93 basis points as a rate of TPV, relative to 87 basis points of the rate last year. The increase in transaction expense as a rate was primarily driven by higher growth in unbranded processing volumes relative to other contributors to our payment volume mix. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV improved to 6 basis points versus 9 basis points last year. Our loss rate in the quarter benefited from the release of a portion of reserves related to recoveries from a merchant insolvency proceeding. This reserve was originally taken in the second quarter of 2022 and was a drag on that quarter's transaction loss performance. In addition, Venmo loss performance improved relative to the fourth quarter last year. Credit losses were $174 million, or 5 basis points as a rate of TPV. We ended Q4 with $7.4 billion in net receivables, reflecting 24% sequential growth. The growth in Buy Now, Pay Later receivables was the largest driver of loan origination. In 2023, we plan to externalize a meaningful portion of our Pay Later receivables portfolio, reducing our balance sheet exposure and securing a sustainable long-term funding partner for this part of our business. The mix of shorter duration originations from our Pay Later products and solid performance of our overall portfolio resulted in a reserve coverage ratio of 7.4%, flat sequentially and 180 basis points lower than the fourth quarter last year. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 12%. This increase was more than offset by a 6% decline in our non-transaction-related expenses. Cost savings initiatives and efficiency gains contributed to this performance across all major expense categories. As a result of this discipline, non-GAAP operating income grew 12% to $1.69 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin reached 22.9%, expanding 115 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021.  In addition, for the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, growing 11% from Q4 '21 and marking the first quarter in 2022 that earnings per share grew on a year-over-year basis. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.9 billion. During the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow, which resulted in $5.1 million of free cash flow generation in 2022. In the fourth quarter, we completed an additional $1 billion in share repurchase, which brings our capital return in 2022 to $4.2 billion, representing 82% of the free cash flow we generated. As noted last summer, we've taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program over the past several quarters. We continue to believe that share repurchase remains an excellent use of capital for our shareholders. I would now like to discuss our outlook for 2023. For the first quarter, as Dan mentioned, we expect revenue to grow approximately 9% on a currency neutral basis and approximately 7.5% at spot to $6.97 billion. We also expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, representing growth of approximately 24%. The first quarter is off to a great start and sets us up well for the year ahead. We are encouraged by what we're seeing, but remain vigilant as there continues to be potential for variability as we move through 2023.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, forecasting four quarters ahead has been especially challenging. And while the direct impact from COVID is now largely behind us, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain. The rate of e-commerce growth in our core markets has decelerated. Inflationary pressures have affected discretionary consumer spending and post-COVID spending patterns are still evolving. As a result, we're not providing guidance for full year revenue growth at this time. We will guide the quarter ahead and believe this is a responsible approach. As Dan indicated, for the full year, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to grow 18%. This is an increase from the outlook of 15% growth we discussed when we reported third quarter results. Relative to our prior expectations for the year, our forecasted tax rate increased, and we now expect the externalization of part of our Pay Later receivables portfolio to result in several cents of dilution. Offsetting these headwinds are benefits from additional cost savings, higher interest income, and from a shift from cash compensation to stock for a portion of our annual incentive plan, increasing share-based compensation. In putting together our financial architecture for the year and guiding 18% non-GAAP EPS growth, we have been prudent about our planning assumptions for our revenue performance and in establishing an efficient cost structure that enables us to deliver on this commitment. We believe we can deliver 18% earnings growth even with revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a currency-neutral basis. That said, our objective is to grow revenue ahead of this baseline. Our revenue growth is highly correlated to discretionary e-commerce spending in our core markets. We are optimistic that when e-commerce growth reaccelerates, we will fare better than most. In addition, our framework contemplates as much as a high single-digit decline in non-transaction-related expenses on a year-over-year basis. Over the past year, we significantly increased the operational rigor with which we run our business. We've sharpened our focus on strategic priorities, strengthened our planning process and increased our discipline with respect to capital allocation.  We've also begun to realize benefits from cost savings initiatives. We are continuing our work removing complexity within our organization. We believe we are on track with streamlining and resetting our cost base and essentially putting ourselves back on a pre-pandemic trajectory with respect to our non-transaction-related expense profile relative to our growth.  Accordingly, we believe we're well positioned to scale more profitably and sustainably going forward. I'd also like to share more on our expectations for foreign exchange. Our revenue guidance for the first quarter contemplates an approximate 150 basis point headwind from FX. Foreign exchange rates, we expect an approximate 1-point headwind to full year revenue growth.  In addition, as we have discussed, we're prioritizing engagement. We have approximately 190 million monthly active unique users on our platform today. Increasing the activity and engagement level of these users, converting new ones and driving more daily use is one of our greatest opportunities.  While we will continue to track and report on our active accounts each quarter, we will no longer guide net new active accounts. Given our strategic focus, we do not expect total active accounts to grow in 2023. That said, we have confidence that our monthly active unique user base will be stable to growing. Finally, in 2023, we expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow. We plan to continue our aggressive posture towards capital return and allocate approximately 75% of our free cash flow to share repurchase in 2023. In closing, we're pleased with the progress we're making across many fronts and with our momentum. Our team is working tirelessly to serve our customers, advance our strategic priorities and improve our cost structure. The cash flow generating power of our business is a competitive differentiator and gives us a high degree of flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline. Whatever macroeconomic conditions we face, we will continue to deepen our focus, invest in innovation in our people for the long term and strengthen our competitive advantages. We look forward to sustainably delivering long-term profitable growth and creating value for our shareholders. Before I pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to give an update on our plans for the year. Later this year, we will host a meeting for the investment community to provide an update on our strategic road map and introduce you to more of our leadership team. We're targeting the latter part of Q2, and we'll share more as we get closer. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator. Julianne, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Dan, wow, big news. I'm sad already, and you're not leaving for another year. It has been such a journey over the last eight years. Can you just talk a little bit more about your thought process, your decision around choosing to retire now versus, say, a year ago or a year from now? And then also perhaps comments on, in your view, what sort of profile would make the ideal next CEO of PayPal? Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. Thanks, Lisa, for that. I'm going to miss you, too. But as you said, we've got a year ahead of us here. So look, there's never a good time to retire because it's always a bittersweet moment. I love working here at PayPal. I love working with all the incredibly talented people here. I'm proud of all we've accomplished. But as I've gotten older, I also realize I have a lot of passions outside the workplace as well. These range from politics to non-profits to academia. I want to do a lot of travel. And frankly, I want to spend a lot more time with the people that I love. But I had two criteria for when that right timing was. I mean the first one was I wanted to be absolutely sure that PayPal was on solid footing with a bright future. And as we look at kind of the quarter we delivered in Q4, as we look at what's happening in Q1 right now, which is coming in much stronger than we anticipated across a wide variety of fronts, we feel that 2023 is shaping up to be a strong year. And we think we have a real nice glide path as we go into '24 as well. And so that kind of like leaving the company in a good place seemed to be a good time for that. And the other thing is that I wanted to be sure that the Board had enough time to do a thorough search and an orderly transition after we find the right CEO. As I mentioned, it's a complex business. We have massive scale on both the consumer side, on the B2B side. We're a financial services company, but we're also a tech company.  We're heavily regulated across the world. There are a number of experience sets and leadership traits that the Board will be looking for. And they'll work with a search firm to look across the entire landscape to be sure that we find the best possible person to seize what I think is a very bright future for PayPal, and I really look forward to working with that person and doing an orderly transition.  And of course, I'm going to be flexible in my time frame. If that happens sooner, great. If it takes longer, I've told the Board that I'm willing to stay on slightly longer as well, just to be sure we get the right person. And until then, you can be sure that every single day, I'm going to be fully focused on execution. Just ask my team that, they'll tell you the same thing, and making sure that we continue the momentum that we have. And so hopefully, that helps a little bit, Lisa. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Dan, I also want to reiterate what Lisa said. Sorry to see you go, but I can only concur that you are very young mid-60s person that we all try to be like.  Let me just ask more on the expectations, if you don't mind. I mean -- and to be sure that you or Gabrielle. You guys touched on, I guess, embedding mid-single digits in the guide, or maybe better than that with your expectation to achieve better. How should we think about the cadence just considering how much higher the growth rate should be starting off in Q1 per your guidance?  And then if you can give us any color on expectations around transaction revenue or OVAS and Braintree or core branded, anything else that could be provided would be great. Thanks guys. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. So Darrin, I want to separate out two things that I was afraid might be conflated, which aren't linked. The first one is, when we were looking at our cost structure to deliver an 18% EPS growth and to make sure that we fully staffed our high conviction growth areas. We wanted to look at what we thought would be a worst-case revenue assumption, because we don't want to be chasing our cost structure for, we were like, okay, what's the worst case going to happen. We could do mid-single digits FXN growth. That would mean that you've got Europe going into recession, U.S. going into recession, inflation stays high, discretionary spend remains muted. And that's what we built our cost structure around to give us and to give you high confidence that the 18% that we're guiding to is something that we can deliver in pretty much any economic scenario that we could imagine. So that's kind of assumption set number one was around our cost structure and the revenue around it. Number two though, is our revenue expectations. And we clearly are expecting something very different than the worst-case scenario that we have in place for our cost structure. We're assuming, as we think about the year ahead that we hold or slightly grow our share globally. As Gabs said in her remarks, there's a lot of moving parts that could happen here, and we want to be responsible in our guidance for revenues. And we saw last year that revenue can move from quarter-to-quarter, but we're pretty darn accurate when we guide in the quarter ahead.  And so we put out a 9% revenue guide in Q1. And frankly, Darrin, Q1 is off to a very strong start for us. We're seeing widespread acceleration both in January and February. We're seeing it in branded checkout, which has stepped up quite nicely from Q4. We're seeing it in our Braintree services as well. Buy Now Pay Later continues to accelerate for us. So much stronger than we expected. We wouldn't say 9% if we didn't feel confident in that number, as well as the 24% at the midpoint on our EPS guide. There's still a lot of the year ahead of us, right? We're five-six weeks into the first quarter, but it's clearly off to a very strong start, and we will have more as we report out Q1 earnings, as we look into Q2 that may inform how we're thinking about the full year. But we just didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. And also, we want to be really responsible in the guidance that we give.  Anything you would to add to that, Gabs? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yeah, maybe just to add a little more detail on kind of the trajectory of the year. I'd say just we're focused on delivering a great year, and we think we've set ourselves up to do that. At the same time, to Dan's point, we're definitely not going to get ahead of ourselves so early on.  I would point out some dynamics though, that we're growing over in 2023 relative to 2022, which will make the first half of the year probably stronger from a revenue growth standpoint than the back half. That really relates to an expectation of Braintree deceleration. Braintree has had exceptional growth, and we have a great ramp of merchant volumes coming on this year with new merchants as well as additional volumes we expect to get from existing merchants. At the same time, just given the exceptional growth we had last year, we do expect a little bit of decel into the back half. I'd also say, given the interest rate environment and how we're currently positioned in our book, we'd expect the incremental benefit from the higher interest rate environment to benefit us more in the first half than the back half as we lap some of those benefits from last year. And so that would create a little bit of decel as well. And then finally, there were some pricing changes that we made in 2022 that were predominantly front-half loaded. And so we start to lap those as well. So just in terms of the shape of the year, I would expect a little bit of decel as we move into the back half. Darrin Peller : That's very helpful. Thanks Dan and Gabrielle. Daniel Schulman : Yeah, you bet, Darrin. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. Dan, I'll add my thanks, and looking forward to a last final year, man, so it should be fun. I wanted to ask quickly on the branded checkout point. It sounds like you feel like you're kind of growing consistent with the market, if that's accurate and what you're seeing kind of early in the year? And perhaps more importantly, what are you thinking about in terms of when we can start to see some of the improvements impact, maybe share, but more importantly, engagement, et cetera, with the customer base. Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. I think that's an incredibly question. You saw probably in our investor deck, James, that our branded checkout volumes grew by 5% for the year, that's lapping 23% in 2021 and 38% in 2020. And that really is following the shape of the e-commerce.  Part of the reason why there's questions around this and some mix commentary is that there's no perfect data source for market share. Share obviously, for us, it varies by country, by channel, whether it's mobile, mobile web, desktop and by merchant size, whether you look at large enterprise or small or midsize. And we look at everything that we possibly can and look at e-commerce growth around the world. And we look at 2022 -- 2022 e-commerce growth is probably mid-single digits, maybe lower than that across the world. By the way, that 5% was roughly the same in the U.S. as well.  And so overall, we feel like we, at a minimum, held share to global trends. And I think there's some interesting commentary out there. But one of the things that is important to realize is digital wallets, in general, including PayPal, have been growing share overall. We grew share over 100 basis points during the pandemic. We've held it since there, but we continue to take share from manual card entry. Manual card entry say, like three years ago, it's 50% of the market. It's still about 30% of the market today. And there's a lot of share to be taken from that by digital wallets.  In addition, a lot of the Buy Now, Pay Later wallets are -- their growth is starting to slow quite meaningfully as they move from growth as their number one objective to making money as their number one objective. And if you look at our Buy Now, Pay Later results, we're clearly gaining share in that, it grew at 102% Buy Now, Pay Later $7 billion of TPV. So we're taking share from there. And if you look across the globe, across the globe, which is how we look at this, you can start with the U.S. And in the U.S., for the year, I think it's clear that we held share, growing at about 5%. And if I look at the fourth quarter, which is we're still digesting. It looks like we gained share in the first part of November coming into the holiday period. It looks like we lost somewhere like 2 to 4 basis points of share during the Cyber 5. And then we held in December. And as I've mentioned, we have accelerated meaningfully in terms of our branded share of checkout coming out of December into January and February. As we look at this, if you exclude Amazon in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, we held share. Again, all of these things are plus or minus 1 or 2 basis points. If you include Amazon, which had an extra Prime Day in the holidays, we might have lost 1 or 2 basis points. But that is the best view that we have for the U.S. right now. What's interesting is when you look at mobile checkout, it's clear that somebody like Apple has some inherent advantages in authentication, exclusive use of the NFC chip. But if you look at where we have implemented our most advanced checkout flows, and as I mentioned in the script, now about third of our top 100 of our most advanced checkout flows, there, even in mobile, we are gaining share. So the things that we are working on and deploying are making a big difference in the market. That's why I'm so proud of what the team has done in improving and really going after share of overall checkout with our latest integrations. Maybe we can talk more about that with another question.  Across the rest of the world, there are some markets like the UK where we're holding share. In Q3, we lost a little bit of share. In Q4, Australia, we've been losing share due to Buy Now, Pay Later players in that market, and we're now starting to pull back on that. And across most of the major countries in Europe, we are either holding or gaining quite a bit of share.  So as I look across the world, there are some places where we're gaining a lot of share, some places like the U.S., where we're probably holding in other countries where we're losing a little bit. But overall, steady in terms of our market share. And I really think the product teams and the sales teams have done an incredible job of looking at what we can do to improve our checkout experiences. We obviously have a lot we can still do. But year after year after year, we're either holding or gaining share. James Faucette : That's great, Dan. Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah, you bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. I'm just curious if your investment in the R&D budget at PayPal has changed given some of the incremental cost savings, the bigger margin expansion. And I think, because we're really focused on the product road map and you got checkout, and it sounds like you're extending unbranded to the SME space, which makes some sense. So just love your latest thinking on balancing the cost savings with investments in product development. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. The first thing we do is ensure that we have all the investments we need to drive our road map. Again, we've honed our focus, sharpened our focus to make sure that we are investing and executing against our high conviction growth areas. And we're doing that since I mean, we are -- the team is making a ton of progress. I mean whether you look at what we've done in Braintree to harden the infrastructure, to create additional capabilities over the holiday season during the Cyber 5, we were five 9s [ph] and above in terms of availability.  And you see that in terms of kind of the new sales, people moving more volume over to us. Braintree's auth rates, something like 390 basis points better than the competitive set. And so a ton of investment there and making a lot of progress. We've put a lot of investment against PPCP, which is our unbranded, small and midsized and channel partner play. And by the way, it's not just unbranded. It has our most advanced checkout flows in it, and we're going to probably take about 20% of our TPV through PPCP with integrations through Shopify, Adobe, TikTok, and move that to our most advanced checkout flows.  And so that, we've invested in, and obviously, the rest of checkout. Like things like our SDK and APIs, two years ago, we were not really playing in that developer market. And today, if you go to Postman, which is like one of the largest sites that developers go to, to look at SDKs and APIs, we're now one of the top 10 requested SDKs and APIs based on both popularity and quality of that. We actually are number seven, number eight at Stripe.  And so we have really gone from almost nowhere to top 10 in terms of our SDK and APIs. And so -- and just all the basic hygiene, the next-gen stuff, we're working on, that is #1 for us. Like we are going to invest as much as we need to into that. We're going to invest in our digital wallets, our unbranded and our checkout. And that's where we are focused, and we have plenty of investment there. At the same time, really, if you look at our non-transaction-related OpEx, and you look over the course of three years ago, we were like 17% growth, then 20% growth, then 2.7, and now low high single-digit negative growth, I guess, is the best way to put it.  If you add all that together, you come up to about 7%. And our traditional OpEx growth was somewhere, I call it, 6% to 8% or so. So we've just come back to where we've been. Honestly, we still have a lot more to go. As I mentioned, we have identified and are executing already against an incremental $600 million. And as we get more and more efficient as a business, you're going to see more and more of a productivity mindset so that we feel as we go into 2024, that we're going to go back to the same place we were, where we consistently grow our operating margin as we grow our top line going forward.  And we're all aligned against that. We feel great about the amount of resource we're investing, but also making sure that we have the right cost structure going forward. Obviously, you're always balancing that. But when we have a balancing decision, we err towards investing. Tien-Tsin Huang : Got it. Thank you, Dan. And my compliments to you on the succession news as well. Daniel Schulman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, Dan, congratulations. I wanted to do a follow-up on engagement. I know it's kind of been a recurring theme on the call. The growth in the payment transactions per active stayed elevated this quarter, 13%. Hoping you can delve into some of the specific drivers, the primary drivers of that and whether you feel it's sustainable in 2023? Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. So I think it's one of the things that we talked about, which is kind of a new piece of information for us is that nearly half of our base is a monthly active user and about 190 million or so. Those monthly active users, without Braintree in the number, because a lot of people are Braintree in that number, without Braintree in the number, use us 6 to 7 times a month. So they're transacting 72 to 90 times a year with us. That is up 40% from 2019. It's up 5% year-over-year. And that -- those characteristics of those MAUs is they have an extremely low churn rate. They are extremely engaged, highly satisfied with high and growing ARPU. Our biggest opportunity is to move our active accounts into our MAUs. We generate an enormous amount of organic active accounts. Enormous. Every single year, they come on to our platform. And they come on to our platform because we're so ubiquitous. We have coverage across 35 million merchant accounts, 80% of the top 1,500 accounts in the U.S. and Europe. And so they come. They make a transaction, or they get a P2P request, and they -- and they do kind of a one and done.  And the way that I think about, probably the best analogy between MAUs, monthly active users, and the rest of our accounts is how the wireless industry thinks about postpaid and prepaid. Our MAUs are our postpaid accounts. Again, they're very satisfied. They have high ARPU, very, very low churn. And they're engaged in our mobile app. They're ready to try new services as we put them on. When we put on a new service, when they try on new service, their ARPU goes up by 25%.  And so we are very focused on ensuring that we grow our MAUs and that we take those tremendous organic number of people that are coming on. By the way, with no cost per gross add on that, not CPGA. Like those organic things are coming in, just constantly at the top of our funnel.  It's a bit of a two-edged sword. One, it kind of -- it adds to churn, obviously, but churn of a base that's not transacting at all. But our opportunity is with -- as we get a better value proposition, a more compelling proposition across our consumer side as we upgrade our merchants into the best possible checkout experiences that we take those active accounts and move them into MAUs. This whole thing about what's happening with your churn, what's happening, that's a false narrative actually. What's really happening is our MAUs are incredibly consistent, staying with us highly satisfied, acting quite a bit and growing. And that's really where our engagement is coming from. That's probably -- for instance, we have 35 million consumers that use us for subscription management. Every single month, we manage their subscriptions automatically for them, whether they be to Hulu or to other subscription management services.  And so those are incredibly sticky high-value customers for us, and we have a ton of focus on moving people to that MAU base, which is why it's such a focus for us as opposed to net active accounts. Jason Kupferberg : Understood. Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Timothy Chiodo : Thanks a lot. I want to drill down a little bit on the core PayPal modern checkout migration progress. The numbers you gave were great to 20 going to one third, going to 50% for gold this year with the top 100. Two follow-ups on that. The first is, could you talk a little bit about the conversion uplift that you see when the new modern checkout experience is integrated there, and that would help us to kind of quantify what one third going to 50 in could mean?  And the second one is, can you talk a little bit about and recap the actions that you're taking to help incentivize that? Clearly, it's a win-win for both you and the client. But what are some of the either financial or people resources that you could allocate to help speed things up? Daniel Schulman : It's a great set of questions. So when we put in the latest checkout experiences, it's anywhere from a low of a 3% lift in conversion up to a 10% of lift in conversion. So that's actually pretty meaningful in terms of what we see. We also see in our latest checkout integrations that we're growing our share there across mobile, across mobile web and desktop.  And with the top 100, it's an account-by-account play. They're quite sophisticated payments teams. They have a lot of legacy integration. And clearly, the increases in conversion matter a lot and also the ability to seamlessly implement our Buy Now, Pay Later, which has the highest loss rates in the industry, lowest loss rates and a great value proposition is another reason for those top 100 plus to move forward on their integrations. And we're making good solid progress, as I mentioned, every single quarter there. Mobile SDK, same thing. Conversion rates up to 10%. We are now in developer portals. Our mobile SDK is a merchant requirement going forward, so no new merchant can come on without being in our most advanced checkout flows. In our mobile SDK, Buy Now, Pay Later will also be included in that in the second half, which is also something that our merchants are really asking for in terms of seamless integration of that. And then PPCP, we have Braintree, and that's -- when somebody signs up for Braintree, they immediately go on to our latest checkout experiences. I already talked about auth rates going up 390 basis points on average when that happens. But PPCP, that's a big opportunity for us. We're going into a $750 billion addressable market that we've never been able to go in before. We're going in both with our sales force direct into midsized customers and for that longer tail through channel partners. As I mentioned, we're already working with Shopify on PPCP. In France, we are beginning integrations with merchants like Adobe and TikTok. And we feel that those channel partners, when we upgrade them to PPCP, they almost instantaneously will upgrade that long tail. And that's, call it, 20% of our TPV out there. So we've got quite a bit of plans to address each part of the market with, I think, pretty significant detail around them and pretty significant movement as well. Timothy Chiodo : Excellent. And thank you for giving the numbers on the conversion. I appreciate that. Daniel Schulman : Yeah, you bet, of course. Okay. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Our next question will come from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Looking at your plans to reduce transaction margin pressure from Braintree over time by expanding it to more profitable segments, including downmarket to SMBs and PPCP, which you've talked about, unbranded full-stack processing with channel partners. Is there anything in your 2023 guidance that contemplates reduced transaction margin pressure from Braintree? And if not, when would you expect some of these initiatives to alleviate that margin pressure? Daniel Schulman : I'll start off and maybe Gab can follow on that. And thank you for the question. So there are a number of high-margin businesses that we add on to Braintree. Braintree itself is a lower-margin business. And by the way, we're serving the highest end of the customers that always have a lower margin structure for us. But a lot of the higher-margin businesses that we had into PayPal or things like risk-as-a-service, we'll be introducing FX-as-a-service, payouts is a higher margin. We're expanding Braintree into both Europe and South America, which are higher margin for us.  So we expect to see unbranded, as a whole, that margin structure move up. And then as we go into the small and midsized merchant with unbranded, that obviously is a much higher margin. PPCP, is more of a call it sort of a mass customization platform. Braintree really is a customized platform because each one of those merchants have unique needs that we need to customize for.  Gab, is there anything else that you'd add? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yeah. I mean, to Dan's point, the geo mix, the merchant mix and the value-added services layer all are margin-enhancing to bring to overall. I'd also say we've talked about investing in the platform. And a lot of those investments that we're making are really to allow us scale that business more efficiently over time. So each incremental piece of volume will actually cost us less to profit as a process.  We're also doing a lot on our own side in terms of how we think about processing as efficiently as possible and doing everything we can to make sure that, over time, we're going to scale those volumes as efficiently as we can. And so I would think about it as a multiyear dynamic in terms of how we think about the progression of Braintree again, sort of as we move more out of the U.S. down into a slightly smaller merchant set overall. In addition, as we layer on the value-added services and the margin profile really does come through. David Togut : Thanks for that. Congratulations, Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thank you so much. Okay. Well, I think we're a little over the top of the hour. I just want to thank everybody for your great questions. Thank you for all the e-mails that you're sending me already. Again, we're going to work quite closely. We're focused on executing against our plan, and look forward to speaking to all of you again soon. Thanks again for your time. Take care. Bye-bye.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter 2023. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we'll refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2023, our planning assumptions for 2023 and our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rates, operating margins and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, May 8, 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabs, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had a good start to the year with stronger than expected growth across our key financial metrics. And I'm particularly pleased to see the TPV from our branded checkout meaningfully accelerate to 6.5% growth FXN, up 200 basis points from Q4, while our unbranded TPV growth also accelerated from Q4 to post year-over-year growth of 30% FXN. Even with the strong start, there remain many challenging issues to navigate as we look forward. Both the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments are complex and difficult to predict. In these times, the strong message I'm giving the PayPal team is to focus on the things we can control. We know that job number one is to invest and innovate to improve our value proposition to our merchants and consumers. Since we honed our strategic priorities last year, we have consistently executed and delivered against our road map. And this work is beginning to reflect in our results. Of course, we still have room to improve in multiple areas, but we are making large strides in upgrading our merchant and consumer experiences, which are both significantly strengthened from a year ago. We are focused on executing in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. As you can tell from our non-transaction-related OpEx performance, we are more than delivering against our plan. As encouraging as these early results are, I would point out that we are just at the beginning as a multiyear efficiency journey. For several years, we've been at the forefront of advanced forms of machine learning and AI to combat fraud and to implement our sophisticated risk management programs. With the new advances of generative AI, we will also be able to accelerate our productivity initiatives. We expect AI will enable us to meaningfully lower our costs for years to come. Furthermore, we believe that AI, combined with our unique scale and sets of data, will drive not only efficiencies, but will also drive a differentiated and unique set of value propositions for our merchants and consumers. So despite the fact that today's macro environment is difficult to forecast, we believe we are well positioned to deliver a strong year and enter next year poised to reap additional revenue streams from the investments we are making in our products while continuing to drive efficiencies and reduce our overall cost structure. Let me now turn to our Q1 results. As I said, we were quite pleased with the quarter. Our revenues grew by 10.4% FXN to $7.04 billion in Q1, nearly 1.5 points better than our guidance. Consequently, we anticipate our full year revenues to be stronger than we expected, with the back half of the year being roughly similar in growth to the front half. We processed $355 billion of TPV, an acceleration of nearly 300 basis points sequentially from Q4 to 12% FXN driven by 5.8 billion transactions in the quarter. With our branded checkout growing by 6.5%, we believe we improved our global share of checkout and gained share in unbranded processing. We saw our monthly active base slightly increased in line with our expectations, while TPA grew by 13% year-over-year. Importantly, our core PayPal consumer transactions per user improved throughout the quarter and, in March, was 400 basis points higher than in March of last year. In addition, we saw a consistent improvement in the quality of new cohorts in Q1 versus last year. For instance, our March cohort of new accounts had 24% higher TPA and 40% higher ARPA than in March of last year. These results strongly reinforce our decision to focus our resources on engagement and driving high-value accounts. Driven by continued discipline and execution, our non-GAAP EPS for Q1 grew by 33% to $1.17, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.07. As a result, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year to $4.95, up 20%. Our three strategic priorities remain consistent : improve our core checkout proposition, grow our unbranded processing and drive adoption of our digital wallets. We are making good and steady progress on each of these interrelated goals. I'd like to highlight our unbranded suite of services, including Braintree and our newest platform for SMBs and channel partners, PayPal Complete Payments. Within the highly fragmented processing ecosystem, our PSP offering across unbranded and other merchant services is growing faster than the market, and we are taking share. We believe that in an apples-to-apples comparison, our volumes in these areas are now roughly equal to that of Android and Stripe. There are four points I want to make regarding our unbranded momentum. First, unbranded processing is a strategic imperative for us. Enabling our merchants with our unbranded service helps ensure that we have a deep relationship with our most important merchants. It enables us to bring our latest and most technologically sophisticated checkout integration across PayPal and Venmo and our Buy Now, Pay Later service to our merchant base. Going forward, we will primarily focus on enabling unbranded processing and our latest branded checkout experiences through Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments. Based on our early observations, our share of branded checkout stabilizes or grows when our latest checkout integrations are in place. Second, we will continue to invest to help ensure our unbranded platforms are best-in-class, enabling our merchants to reduce fraud and increase their sales conversion rates. We will do this while providing a comprehensive orchestration layer that enables our merchants to have a single point of contact and integration in a multi-PSP environment. Our platform reliability is now amongst the best-in-class, and our integrated servicing capabilities are increasingly differentiated. Third, we are focused on substantially improving the margin structure of our unbranded business. Our PayPal Complete Payments platform opens a new $750 billion TAM in the small and midsized business market, with a significantly enhanced margin structure compared with our largest enterprise customers. Our Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments platforms are also expanding overseas where we can drive higher margins. And we are adding value-added services to our platform like Risk-as-a-Service, full omnichannel capabilities, payouts and FX-as-a-Service to both enhance functionality and add incremental margins. And finally, enabling merchants with our unbranded services will provide a constant stream of incremental data to feed our AI engines and fuel our next-generation checkout platform. We believe no other company will be able to replicate the unique nature and scale of our data set. And in the future, our AI engines will use that data to drive differentiated capabilities to improve the entire checkout experience for our merchants. We anticipate that this combination of initiatives will enable our unbranded services to become a clear market leader, drive additional growth in our branded checkout, enable our next generation of checkout and provide new sources of margin growth. And I would add that we continue to win and expand services with new marquee customers like Live Nation, Booking.com and Adobe. Our focused efforts in improving our branded checkout are clearly making a difference in the market and in our results. Our product and engineering teams have driven substantial improvements in availability, latency and passwordless login. We also expect that our in-app native checkout solution via our APIs and SDKs, along with the deployment of our PayPal Complete Payments platform to our largest channel partners, should begin to bear significant fruit in bringing our legacy base to our latest integrations. Buy Now, Pay Later continues to provide meaningful value to both our consumers and merchants. Over 32 million consumers have used our Buy Now, Pay Later since inception at nearly 3 million merchants. We are now one of the most popular Buy Now, Pay Later services in the world with $6 billion of TPV in Q1, growing at 70% on a currency-neutral basis. Consumers spend 30% more on our branded checkout when using Buy Now, Pay Later, and we believe we have amongst the highest authorization rates and lowest loss rates in the industry. Venmo continues to grow its revenues by double digits, and we were pleased to see its TPV accelerate 550 basis points from Q4 to $63 billion. We're continually working to improve the Venmo P2P experience. This quarter, we launched an easier, more intuitive way to split P2P payments across multiple people, and we also increased the ad funds limit for Venmo to $10,000. We recently added the ability for Venmo customers to transfer crypto to other users and external wallets, bringing it on par with the experience on PayPal. Later this year, we will add the ability for a Venmo user to pay a PayPal user and vice versa, bringing more utility to both customer bases. We are currently piloting the upcoming launch of Venmo teen accounts, which have been requested by both parents and teens for some time. Our Amazon and Starbucks experiences continue to grow nicely, and we recently launched PayPal and Venmo with McDonald's and just signed a deal with Microsoft to launch both Pay with Venmo and Buy Now, Pay Later for Microsoft's Xbox store. Finally, I'd like to briefly touch on the search for my successor. The Board has formed a subcommittee, and we are working with a leading search firm. We have detailed sense of criteria and skill sets to access both internal and external candidates. We still plan to announce my replacement before year-end, and the process is well underway. One of the most important criteria influencing my decision to retire was that felt that PayPal was on the right path to emerge from this economic climate in not only strong financial health, but also as a clear market leader in payments. Our results this quarter are another solid proof point that we are on that path. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and excellent execution. We still have a lot to accomplish and prove, but our customers are responding to our efforts, and that is and will always be our North Star. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gabs. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us to deliver a great quarter. Our results demonstrate the relevance, diversification and strength of our payments platform. We are reporting healthy volume and revenue growth. This solid top line performance, in conjunction with expense management and efficiency gains, resulted in outstanding earnings growth. Notably, we accelerated our revenue and earnings growth on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Relative to the first quarter targets we shared with you in February, both our revenue and EPS outperformed. The foundation we established last year for cost discipline and to realize productivity gains allowed us to expand operating margins and deliver profitable growth. Before discussing our outlook for the second quarter, I'd like to review our first quarter results. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis and 9% at spot to $7.04 billion. This represents a three-year revenue CAGR of 15% and 20%, excluding eBay. Transaction revenue grew 6% to $6.4 billion driven primarily by our unbranded processing volume. Other value-added services revenue grew 39% to $676 million, predominantly due to higher interest income on customer store balances and, to a lesser extent, solid performance from consumer and merchant credit. In the first quarter, U.S. revenue grew 13%. International revenue grew 3% spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis, accelerating both year-over-year and sequentially. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 93 basis points, 5 basis points higher than Q1 last year. This increase was primarily driven by 30% growth in our unbranded processing volumes. These volumes grew approximately 3x faster than our overall TPV growth. As a result, transaction expense dollars grew 17%. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, a 2 basis point improvement versus last year. Transaction loss dollars declined 7%. Our ongoing risk mitigation activities and our mix of volumes drove this improved performance. Credit losses were $142 million or 4 basis points as a rate of TPV. We ended Q1 with $7.5 billion in net receivables, flat sequentially. Originations were primarily driven by the strength of our Buy Now, Pay Later franchise. As we have discussed, later this year, we plan to externalize a significant portion of this portfolio, reducing our balance sheet exposure as securing a long-term partner to support sustainable and healthy growth. Our reserve coverage ratio increased sequentially to 7.8% in Q1 from 7.4%, reflecting growth in the consumer receivables portfolio and some deterioration in our PayPal business loans portfolio. Relative to Q1 2022, our reserve coverage ratio improved 50 basis points. Similar to the broader industry, overall, we're seeing a normalization of our credit portfolio to pre-COVID delinquency levels. We continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our credit portfolio and are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment while making appropriate adjustments to ensure we continue to perform within our internal risk appetite. Continuing the trend from 2022, growth of unbranded processing volume outpaced growth in branded volume, resulting in slower transaction margin dollar growth. Volume-based expenses in the aggregate increased 17%, and transaction margin dollars grew 1% to $3.3 billion. Transaction margin declined to 47.1% from 50.9% in Q1 last year. While we do anticipate ongoing mix shift, we believe that this performance will improve as we execute against the strategies that Dan outlined to drive increased profitability across our unbranded processing volume and accelerated growth of our branded franchise. Strong discipline across non-transaction-related operating expenses more than offset the contraction in transaction margin. On a non-GAAP basis, non-transaction-related operating expenses declined more than 12%, with reductions in sales and marketing, technology and development, and customer support and operations expenses contributing significant leverage. This expense performance resulted in 19% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth in operating income that we have experienced in eight quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin reached 22.7%, expanding 201 basis points from the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we're pleased to be reported $1.17 in non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1, representing 33% growth year-over-year. We continue to be in a very strong position from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, ending the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow. Cash taxes related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property reduced operating cash flow by approximately $430 million. And in Q1, we allocated $1.4 billion to share repurchases. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow and to repurchase roughly $4 billion of our shares. I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the second quarter and update our outlook for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on a currency-neutral basis and 6.5% to 7% at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.17, representing growth of approximately 25% at the midpoint of the range. For the full year, given our earnings outperformance in the first quarter, we are raising our outlook. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 20% to approximately $4.95, an increase of 2 points of growth from the guidance we shared in February. At the start of the year, we indicated that our framework for 18% non-GAAP EPS growth in 2023, contemplated revenue growth coming in as low as mid-single digits. We also shared that our objective was to deliver revenue performance that exceeded this baseline. Our first quarter performance and the guidance for the second quarter are meaningful steps towards achieving this objective. As Dan indicated, assuming that current macro conditions continue, we now expect our back half revenue growth to be roughly in line with our performance in the first half of the year. Additionally, based on the expected contribution of unbranded processing volumes to our growth, we now expect at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2023. We are encouraged by our start to the year, and at the same time, mindful that the environment remains dynamic. We're focused on execution and will be agile and responsive to how the macroeconomic environment is playing out. And we plan to continue to guide revenue one quarter at a time. To wrap up, we entered the year as a more focused business with strong fundamentals. We're off to a great start in 2023 and believe we're well positioned to deliver revenue and earnings growth, expand margins and generate strong free cash flow. We're continuing to invest to accelerate our growth and capture the meaningful opportunity ahead of us. In addition, our expansive scale enables us to realize additional efficiencies and productivity gains. We believe our digital payments platform is unrivaled in breadth and depth, which creates a powerful competitive advantage for us. And we have conviction that our strategy to accelerate our branded checkout franchise, improve the margin profile of our unbranded processing platform and strengthen our digital wallet will result in significant and enduring value creation for our shareholders. We look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Sarah, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks a lot. Nice performance here on revenue. So I'll ask one question there. Looks like Q1 clearly had -- like you talked about the second quarter revenue growth is in line with what we have in the model. It's 3 points lower than what was just reported here. And then you're calling for second half in line with the first half, which is better than what we modeled and better than what you guys talked about before. So my question is, how much of this change is macro-related versus maybe some momentum with some of the new products and integrations that, Dan, you're talking about as well as curious on share gains, if your thinking is different there. And we've been curious if you've seen any sort of benefit from flight to quality with all the stresses in the banking system. Somewhere every work suggests that. So love to hear your thoughts on that, if you don't mind. Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Sure. That was one question? Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. No, it's a lot. Sorry. Daniel Schulman : So let me start with that and then Gabs can come in. First of all, obviously, we had a real strong start to the year, was stronger than our expectations, but we just missed around 11% FXN revenue growth at 10.4%. It's still 150 basis points better than our expectations on that. And I think what really pleased us on that is all parts of the business accelerated. You had TPV gone up 300 basis points sequentially from Q4 to 12%. Branded grew by 200 basis points to 6.5%. Growth unbranded just continues to fire on all cylinders at 30%. And even Venmo was up almost 600 basis points. And so it's a good strong start. And the other thing that we didn't mention is our Net Promoter Score, which is kind of how do our customers feel about us, is at a 5-year high this quarter. So obviously, a lot of things are going the way that we hoped they would be. I think if you look at second quarter coming down, third quarter and then fourth quarter, we're lapping some onetime events in Q2 and Q3. That put pressure of about 1 point to 1.5 points on our growth. Normalized, you'd have Q2 off of those onetime things growing 8.5%, 9% or so. So that's kind of the normalized growth in the quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year in the back half what's changed in our outlook, first of all, we're one-third of the way through the year as opposed to just coming into the year. And there are two things that we think are happening right now. First of all, our initiatives are taking hold in the market. There's no silver bullet on any one thing that comes in. These are a number of small things, whether it be improving latency 40% in the last year. Our goal is to improve it by 50% by the end of this year. Our availability being at an all-time high. We are pretty much at 5.9s almost all the time. We're fixing bugs all over. We're reducing friction. There are less calls coming into service unbranded. We put a lot of investment in that, and it is taking off. And we have very high expectations for what PCP can do in the small and midsized market and with our channel partners as well. And we're seeing things like new cohort strength, as I mentioned in my remark, that are significantly higher than cohorts we've seen in quite some time. And so we know we still have a lot to go -- to do there. But when you have scale like ours, Tien-Tsin, and you start making small incremental improvements, it has a flywheel effect. And so we're pretty pleased with what we're seeing there. The other thing is, look, we came into the year with really muted expectations around e-commerce global, e-commerce growth. We thought it could be anywhere from like negative 2% to maybe positive 2%, call it flat in general. We saw that pickup in first quarter. We think it could be low single digits, maybe mid -- as high as mid-single digits. Clearly, consumers are turning more of their spend to e-commerce, and I think many of us expect it. And as long as we continue to see those trends, we think now it is very different than what we thought coming in that the back half growth is going to be equal to our first half growth. So it's a much improved outlook than we have before. Gabs, anything you want to add? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : No. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Daniel Schulman : Yes. You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for all the detail on the unbranded strategy. Just a couple of follow-up questions there, Dan, for you. One, can you elaborate a little bit on what's driving the 30% growth in unbranded TPV and how sustainable that is? Meaning, like, is it a couple of large clients that will eventually lap? Or is this more broad-based growth? And then second, can you just talk a little bit more about PayPal Complete Payments competitive positioning downmarket and where exactly you think that's going to win and what -- how quickly that will ramp? Thank you. Daniel Schulman : Yes. So Braintree continues to do extraordinarily well. And it's not just winning incremental clients, but we are growing our share of the overall PSP volume in our largest clients as well. Look, we did expect Braintree and we do expect Braintree to moderate its growth, lapping some big deals last year. But honestly, we're working on some big deals this year, too. And we've got a lot of momentum in Braintree. And I think its success -- it's differentiated. It's driven by an open architecture where we are perfectly willing to orchestrate transactions to third-party services and other PSPs. And we've got our integrated servicing. We've got our availability. I think now it's amongst best-in-class. I think we've got the lowest loss rates fraud in the industry, some of the highest loss rates may be up to 390 basis points better than others. And we've got a number of great value-added services that others have, but we're expanding to, whether they be APMs or vaulting real time card updates on payouts, and we're adding more and more that are really valuable to clients and also are very high margin like FX-as-a-Service. If you look at audience results and you see how much comes from their profits come from FX-as-a-Service, you can see why we're eager to add that. On the PPCP side of it, there are obviously some benefits as you move into the small and midsized market. First of all, you obviously have a higher margin structure than you do with your large enterprises. And we clearly see that even in the PayPal button dynamics that we have. It's a really flexible, simple integration. It's fully featured as well. It's got all the APMs, including Apple Pay. It's got vaulting IP plus, real-time account update or it's got all of our latest integrations. And it's integrated with Zettle for omnichannel capabilities. And it also is targeted at channel partners. And that's a really important thing. And we're making some really, good progress in our initial conversations with last of our major channel partners. If those channel partners are hosted, they run their services as a hosted service, once we upgrade them to PPCP, our latest checkout integrations very quickly move into that merchant base, that's part of those channel partners. And it's a way of moving our long tail of merchants on to our latest checkout integrations. We're now, fully live with PPCP here in the U.S. We'll expand to EU and to Australia next quarter. And the other really important thing about our unbranded services besides, the fact that they've got a deep relationship with our most important clients, if they drive a ton of data into our machine learning and AI engines, it's why we have amongst the lowest loss rates in the industry, the lowest instances of fraud, the highest conversion rates. And so, we're not looking all of that together, it's why I really spend time calling out why unbranded is a strategic imperative for us. People have asked us about our transaction margin, what's happening with that, looking at our growth of unbranded. To me, that is a high-class problem for us to have. We are winning in that market faster than we anticipated. We have a very well thought through strategy and set of actions to drive margin in that business. And we're very focused on making that happen, and we're seeing the beginnings of that already happening. So I appreciate the question, Lisa. I think it's a really important one. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Daniel Schulman : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Hi guys, thanks. Braintree growth and mix obviously were a factor on the take rate in margins. But if you could just help us understand the dynamics of margins in the second half. I know you're lowering incremental margin guidance by 25 bps to 100 basis points despite with obviously very strong expense management results? Maybe you could just help us understand how much of that is related to either the Braintree mix versus, any other variables in the second half we have to keep in mind. And just as a quick add-on to that, when would we expect the strength of the Braintree volume, we're seeing to actually translate to some higher-margin offerings at a faster pace? Thanks again guys. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, you bet. I'll start. You're right. So, we have some margin dynamics that are worth calling out, as it relates to first half versus second half performance, specifically as it relates to operating margin. Our Q1 operating margin performance was very, very strong with about 200 basis points operating margin expansion. In Q2, our expectation is actually that it would be ahead of that from an expansion standpoint. And so, we're really delivering the vast majority of the margin expansion on the year from an operating margin standpoint in the first half of the year. The back half, we actually have some lapping dynamics and some nuances that will result in much more modest operating margin expansion for 2H overall. Within that, I'd say it's worth highlighting that Q3, I'd expect to see some pressure on operating margin, maybe some slight pressure. And then in Q4, we'll see expansion again, but more modest expansion than you're seeing in the first half of the year, and really sort of what the drivers of that are, and Dan highlighted a few of them. We do have some lapping dynamics in the back half of the year. In Q3, specifically, there were some benefits on the TE side. We're also beginning to really lap, the benefit from increased interest rates. And the increased revenue that we earn on customer store balances, that really starts in Q3 continued in Q4. So as we lap that, don't expect to see as much operating margin expansion in the back half. In addition, we began to really lap a lot of the cost savings work that started in the back half of last year. And so, while we do expect to see a meaningful decline in non-transaction-related operating expenses in both Q3 and Q4, from a percentage decline standpoint, it will not be as great as what we're seeing in Q1 and Q2. And so, all that taken together will result in that differential between the first half and the back half op margin expansion for the full year. Again, we do expect to see at least 100 basis points of op margin expansion. That change that you called out between the 125 and at least 100, that is predominantly driven by the fact that when we're talking about our revenue being slightly ahead. A lot of the benefit that we're seeing is coming from the Braintree business and having a lot more visibility in that pipeline, and that's contributing to our top line, but also having some margin impact. Dan, do you want to talk a little bit about the strategies in unbranded? Daniel Schulman : Yes, I think maybe I'll take a step back for a second. I mean I think, look, our strategy on average and over time is to deliver double-digit EPS growth year-after-year-after-year. And we've had a good track record in general of doing that. We've got a well thought through strategy and a set of actions that's going to deliver increased transaction margin dollars, along with OpEx reductions, to make sure that we do that. We've talked a lot about the initiatives that we're focused on, and we've been focused on the same thing for over a year now. Its drive branded checkout that's our #1 priority. All of our initiatives are linked to that. It's our highest margin service. It's our bread and butter, and we're absolutely determined to have that be best-in-class. We want to drive unbranded, because of all the things I talked about in my remarks. It helps us on branded share of checkout. It helps us in our data collection and all of the things we can do with those, unique sense of data. In unbranded will be a new source of margin generation for us, without question. We are beginning to put those services already into place. Many of them will go into place by the fourth quarter, and I expect to see the majority of those things start to take effect in 2024. And then clearly, we're managing our OpEx extremely well. And I can talk with more detail on that if anyone has a question on it. But we said - we thought it would be, negative high single-digits this year. It's likely to be 10%, negative 10% plus. And if anybody thought costs were going up, they'll go down again next year as well. I can talk more about that. But we've got a real set of initiatives and strategies focused on this. We're executing against it, I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver on what we set out to do. Darrin Peller : It's really helpful guys. Thank you both. Daniel Schulman : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks guys. Good to see the improved revenue outlook here. I actually wanted to switch over to the branded side of TPV growth. As you mentioned, you had a couple of points of acceleration there. Wanted to understand which countries or verticals or other drivers, what was behind that?  Would you attribute any material amount of the improvement through the rollout of advanced checkout? And then just any directional comments on how branded checkout TPV growth may trend during the balance of the year in support of the revenue outlook you talked about? Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think maybe I'll grab that one. So if I just take a step back for a second, like we're the market leader in online checkout, right? We've got 35 million merchants, except those 80% of the top 1,500 online retailers in the U.S., except as there's no other is wallet that comes close to that acceptance. Yes in general, our auth rates are about 600 basis points better than the industry average. It means every time a hundred things that a consumer does to buy from a merchant we approved six more of them. And we've got consumer trust and brand trust in that when a smaller midsized merchant puts PayPal on their website. They see a 44% conversion lift by doing that. So these are really strong advantages that we're going to leverage going forward. But obviously, there's a ton of stuff we can still do, right? We're optimizing presentment. We're making sure that our best-in-class integrations are out there, whether that comes through our branded checkout, whether that comes through the new SDKs and APIs that we have, whether that comes through PPCP, going into channel partners. So - because we know when we have our best-in-class integrations, we either have stable share or growing share of checkout. Our availability, as I mentioned, is closing in our 5 9s of latency, improved it by 40%. We'll improve it up to 50% better, makes a giant difference in conversion rates. Our passwordless login improved by 10 full points last year. We intend to grow that again this year, whether that be through pass keys or other ID or forms of biometrics. Buy Now, Pay Later, we're taking share there, and we are intending to continue to take share there. Our auth rates are higher, we think, than anyone else is because we know the customers coming in -- over 90% of the customers coming in to Buy Now, Pay Later are already PayPal, customers that's why we think we also have the lowest loss rates. And we know - somebody mentioned flight to quality - that people are coming to PayPal and our Buy Now, Pay Later services. And we are targeting all of the largest merchants. We know when our competitors contracts are up, and we are going after that business because we see a clear shift in market share as well as spend when we have Buy Now, Pay Later in our checkout flows. And obviously, we're now full GA on our mobile checkout with our SDKs and APIs. And we are now beginning to experiment with the first generation of what we call AI-powered checkout, which looks at the full checkout experience, not just the PayPal checkout experience, but the full checkout experience for our merchants. So we have a lot of things underway in our branded checkout. But I will just say this, the team is executing extremely well here. When they say they're going to get something done, they do. They have a road map that they are consistently executing. What they think will happen is happening in the market. And so I've got a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see branded share of checkout be strong. And we saw, by the way, in U.S., U.K. Germany, France, it'll expand most of the EU markets, Australia and improvement in our share position. Of course, there's odd one uniform measure of market share, but any way you look at it when you're a branded share or your growth goes up sequentially by 200 basis points, that's a lot of momentum. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks Dan. Daniel Schulman : Yes you bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : How are you thinking about the opportunity for cost savings and OpEx reduction beyond 2023? And in particular, if you could maybe weigh that against potential transaction margin dynamics as well to the extent those will continue next year based on the trend we saw in Q1. Daniel Schulman : Yes. I'll start off, and then Gabs can attack the last part of your question. First of all, obviously, we had good solid progress against what we said we're going to do, negative 12% in Q1. I think our OpEx for the full year could decline as much as negative 10%, which is a bit higher than we expected. And as I said in my remarks, we're just beginning on this efficiency journey. I think you're going to see our costs continue to come down year-over-year-over-year. And this is not just about efficiencies. By the way, it's not about cost reduction. It's about doing things better. There's no question that AI is going to impact almost every function inside of PayPal, whether it be our front office, back office, marketing, legal, engineering, you name it. AI will have an impact and allow us to not just lower cost, but have higher performance and do things that is not about trade-offs. It's about doing both in there. The other thing that the teams are doing and doing extremely well is they're improving processes. Right now, they're removing friction with a much simpler onboarding process, first transaction resolution. We're seeing better engagement as a result, fewer calls, as I mentioned, higher NPS. You're seeing that in our newest cohorts coming in with significantly higher TPA and ARPA. And so, I think this is going to be a cost journey that we'll be on for a long time to come. And I think at the same time, we'll just be doing things better than we've ever been doing them before as well. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes. David Togut : Understood. Yes. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Oh please go ahead, David. David Togut : Yes. No. Just the second piece of that as well, Dan, which is, is there an inflection point you see coming in terms of transaction margin dollar growth accelerating at some point later this year or in early 2024? Daniel Schulman : Do you want to take that? Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes. So I really think about it as a multiyear journey that we're on to continue to transition the business and really drive more profitable volumes through the unbranded processing side, while at the same time accelerating the growth in branded. We're off to a really good start. Q1, we saw acceleration in the branded business. It was very broad-based in terms of what we were seeing. And we continue to see very strong growth on the unbranded side of the platform. Sequential acceleration on unbranded given its size and scale is very impressive. Given the beta business that we run, it will take some time to see what I would see an inflection point in the overall sort of TM dynamics. I would say Q1 did have some nuances to it, which included about 130 basis impact just from normalizing our credit provisions. So that's not specifically related to unbranded, branded mix. It really was sort of credit loss provisioning that impacted the TM rate as well. But to your point, as we move through the year, we do continue to expect to see a continuation of the TM dynamic that's put out in Q1. There are some exciting trends that we're seeing in the business, however. So I'd say what we saw in cross-border in Q1 and the growth in that business is quite encouraging. It was the strongest quarter we had for cross-border really since Q4 of 2021. That, of course, has a higher yield to it overall. So as we start to see some of those pieces of the business pick up, that will also help. And then just from a TM standpoint, we did see some pressure as well in Q1 specifically on the unbranded side for PayPal. And this is not Brain business. This is the transitioning of our unbranded processing on the PayPal side to PPCP has created some pressure in the quarter, which we don't to be sort of ongoing as we think about how we exit the year given what our expectations are for PPCP. So we're continuing to be disciplined about the growth of the business. We do expect all these strategies to start to play out and start to help turn the overall TM profile, but I would expect it's going to take a number of quarters before we see what we would call an inflexion point. David Togut : Thank you. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Hi, good afternoon, Dan and Gabrielle, thanks a lot of time this afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on one of the comments or topics you've mentioned quite a bit on this call, Dan, that's around engagement. I wonder if you can give some update. You've mentioned that there's been some improvement in engagement, but I'm wondering if you can give an update on those initiatives, more specifically, how that's helping engagement and conversion, especially things like advanced checkout, et cetera? And what kind of lift you're getting from that? And maybe give a little more detail of how we should think about the tie into some of the unbranded initiatives and if we think there can be further at least improvement in those engagement levels or uptake by merchants, et cetera? Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Sure. So first of all, as I mentioned, kind of we've got these three initiatives, they all tie together, and they all lead to driving more share and volume of branded checkout. So as we do more and more on our unbranded, we put out our latest integrations into the market. And when we put out our latest integrations in the market, we take away friction, we take away latency, and we see more engagement, and a lot more checkout go through our latest integrations. But one of the initiatives that we haven't really spent time talking about point is what we're doing on our digital wallets. So those are the three, right, drive engagement and monthly active users and ARPA through our digital wallets, drive our checkout, drive our own brand, and they're all linked together and then keep a tight envelope on our cost structure. Those are the four things that we're focused on. In the wallet, we're making good solid progress, whether that be on our Venmo wallet on the PayPal side of it. Look, the PayPal app is already one of the largest commerce and payments apps in the world. It's used by about 55% of our base right now. That's up about 600 basis points year-over-year. And our app users are predominantly our monthly active users and our power users. They've got 35% more ARPU. They've got 58% greater transactions for active on it. And their churn is at least 25% less than the rest of the base. And the thing that I'm really pleased to see what John Kim and his team are doing is that the velocity of experimentation in our wallets now is like nothing that we've seen in quite some time. We have constant champion challenger, hypotheses going out, replacing challengers that have been overcome by the champion, and that just starts to lead to more and more engagement going through. As I mentioned on the consumer side, we saw consumer transactions per user increase every single month in the quarter. In March, they are 400 basis points better than March a year ago. And the whole idea of the apps right now are three specific areas. One, upfront prepurchase, call that shopping, where it's really about discovery, saving and rewards. We introduced rewards recently. We have over 6 million monthly active users in our rewards right now. Those that are using it have an increase in the 6 million of 45% in their transactions per active. I mean these are huge numbers. We obviously need to go from 6 million to 10 million to 25 million, but that will happen over time. Then we have purchase, which is all about being the most flexible, easy way to purchase. Buy Now, Pay Later really plays into that. And there, we're clearly taking share. We clearly intend to drive that. And then we have post purchase, which is like things like how do I track my packages? How do I get refunds easily? How do I put that right into my wallet? And there, I talked about this in the last earnings call, on package tracking, we're now 100% ramped in iOS. We do all the package scraping now off of Gmail. So in one place, you can see all of your PayPal purchases and non-PayPal purchases. So you can track all of that in one place. And again, for those users that have started to do that, their app engagement is up 32%, and their transactions are up 20%. And so all of these things, James, when you think about what we're doing on just being better in checkout, driving unbranded so that we can drive better integrations going forward and what we're doing in the wallet, they all link together to really drive our MAUs, which are our most valuable customers by far and away, and they went up slightly in Q1. They are 20x, 30x more valuable than just an active user out there and to drive transactions and ARPA. So this is a flywheel. As you have said, it takes time to drive it. But a lot of the things we're seeing right now, the reason we are taking up our expectations for what we think our revenue growth will be, taking up kind of our EPS as well is because we're seeing distinct improvements take place in the market. James Faucette : That's all I have. Thanks for that Dan. Daniel Schulman : Yes, you bet. My pleasure. Operator : We have time for one last question from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan Keane : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about credit. Are you managing to book any different on credit given the macro and exposure to BNPL and merchants and just thinking about maybe the impact of provisions for credit losses for the rest of fiscal year '23 maybe as a result of managing the book any different. Thanks. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes, you bet. Thanks, Bryan. So you'll see in the Q, which will be filed tomorrow, we did increase the provisions on the PBPL portfolio, which is the PayPal business loans portfolio. Overall, that portfolio is about 17% of our overall receivables, so sort of a sliver of our overall book. We did widen our credit box in the middle of last year. We have seen some performance that was less strong than we would have liked that is working its way through our system. And so we increased the provisions. We've already started to see an improvement overall in a box. I mean that's something that we'll just work its way through our systems. We expect delinquencies to worsen through Q2 peak in this quarter and improve throughout the remainder of the year based upon the origination strategy. But really, that piece of the book is a very small component of the overall portfolio. And I'd say more importantly, the area that we're really growing where we're really growing where the originations are quite strong continues to be the Buy Now, Pay Later portfolio. And there, we've seen very broad-based strength. And so that's a really important part of our strategy. It supports the improved checkout performance in our business on the branded side, and we're excited about the continued growth of that business overall. We did mention in the prepared remarks that our expectation is to externalize part of that portfolio during this year and work with a partner to really provide sort of longer-term sustained support for growth in that portfolio. As I say, overall, we continue to be very pleased with our credit portfolio. We've seen very good performance in -- across the book. We are seeing some normalization, which we expected to see as it relates to just sort of kind of normalization post COVID and really getting back to what we historically seen in terms of performance. But in terms of reserve coverage, when we take a look at reserve coverage today versus when CECL started, which was the first quarter of 2020, we're actually a few hundred points -- a few hundred basis points better overall. And so the book itself continues to be quite healthy. Bryan Keane : Got it. Thanks so much. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : You bet. Daniel Schulman : All right. Well, I think we're at the top of the hour. So I just want to thank everybody for your great questions. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. So thanks, everybody. Take care. Bye-bye.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter 2023. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023 are planning assumptions for 2023. Our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rates, operating margin impact from our sale of loans to KKR and share repurchase activity. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, August 2, 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman : Thanks, Gabe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. I'm proud of the PayPal team as we delivered another solid quarter. Revenues came in above the top end of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS grew 24% to $1.16 in line with the midpoint of our guide. And we are reiterating our guidance for non-GAAP EPS and operating margin expansion for the full year. Encouragingly, e-commerce growth appears to have stabilized in the mid-single digits, substantially above our estimates when we entered 2023. Our branded checkout volumes grew roughly in line with the industry in Q2 and accelerated to nearly 6.5% growth in the month of June, and in July, our branded checkout volume growth accelerated again to over 8%, our highest monthly growth rate since the end of the pandemic. We expect branded checkout volumes will strengthen throughout the back half of the year, supported by traction from our key strategic initiatives. Of course, we still face a fluid global macroeconomic environment. However, it is quite encouraging to see core inflation rates continue to come down. As inflation cools, we would expect to see discretionary spending rise, which we believe will support and possibly accelerate the overall growth of e-commerce spending. And as the market leader in digital payments, any uptick in e-commerce will accelerate our growth. Revenues in Q2 grew by 8% on a currency-neutral basis to approximately $7.3 billion. It's instructive to note that we are lapping certain items that provided an outsized benefit to us in Q2 and Q3 last year. Consequently, those items pressure our revenue growth rate by approximately 1.25% in each of those quarters this year. Excluding these items, our growth in Q2 would have been between 9% and 10%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect our revenue growth in the second half of the year to be roughly the same as and given recent trends, maybe a bit better than the first half. We expect Q3 revenues to grow approximately 8% on a currency-neutral basis. I would highlight that July was a very strong start to the quarter with currency-neutral revenue growth of 9% and TPV growth accelerating into the low teens. And for the year, we anticipate our revenue growth to be between 9% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to exercise good discipline in managing operating expenses. For the quarter, non-GAAP nontransaction-related expenses fell 11% year-over-year. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.4%, up approximately 230 basis points from a year ago. We expect to increase our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year by at least 100 basis points. As we look ahead to the rest of 2023 and into 2024, we expect to drive meaningful productivity improvements. Our initial experiences with AI and continuing advances in our processes, infrastructure and product quality, enable us to see a future where we do things better, faster and cheaper. These overall cost savings come even as we significantly invest against our three strategic priorities. We know exactly what we need to do as we look towards 2024. And as you can see in our results, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. We understand that over the medium to long term, we need to deliver growth in our transaction margin dollars to ensure we sustainably grow our earnings. And we are beginning to see clear signs that our initiatives will yield notable traction against that objective over the next several quarters. As I mentioned, we expect our top line to accelerate to low double-digit growth by Q4. We expect transaction margin dollars to increase while our operating expenses continue to create significant leverage. That in connection with our share buybacks enables us to target low to mid-teens EPS growth for the remainder of 2023, even as we begin to lap the increases we enjoyed on our interest income. I'd like to now turn to our three strategic priorities in which we are investing our resources and energy, branded checkout, our PSC merchant solutions and our digital wallets. As I've mentioned in the past, all three of these are critical and interrelated. They are essential for us to increase our share of the e-commerce market as well as accelerate our margin dollar growth. As we discussed in our June investor meeting, we are meaningfully accelerating new product innovations into the market, scaling our A/B testing and significantly improving our time to market. We are now consistently delivering against our road map on schedule. This is the result of significant investments in our platform infrastructure and tools and enhanced set of measurements and performance indicators, hiring new talent and early successes using AI in our software development process. We continue to ramp our test velocity with more than 300 experiments launched across our product experience in the first half of the year. Every successful test leads to incremental customer benefits and the cumulative effect of those changes leads to noticeable improvements in our key metrics, including the gains we are seeing in branded checkout growth. For instance, our buy now, pay later traction has meaningfully accelerated with the introduction of preapproved amounts to our consumers. Our work in onboarding and onboarding new experiences has driven new monthly cohorts with higher engagement and lifetime value. In this month, we are expanding the rollout of Paske [ph] in the U.S. and Europe, which will greatly simplify the branded checkout log-in experience and drive improved authorization rates that will further extend our lead over our competitors. Our goal is to continually close the gap in our log-in and checkout experiences every quarter and to be equal to or better than any competitor within the next year. We simultaneously aim to drive differentiated wallet experiences across both PayPal and Venmo. We believe that only those companies with unique and scaled data sets, we'll be able to fully utilize the power of AI to drive actionable insights and differentiated value propositions for their customers. We are already experimenting internally with an AI-driven PayPal assistant. We envision that a version of this will be part of our consumer app, and we plan to introduce it later this year. We continue to see impressive traction in our PSP business with our growth rates nearly 30% on a currency-neutral basis. Many of the largest tech companies in the world are now either using our Braintree capabilities or are in deep strategic negotiations with us to do so. We are in the process of rolling out high-margin, value-added services, expanding internationally and making noticeable progress with in-person payments. And we continue to receive exceptional interest in our next-generation checkout solution, which will leverage the scale of our network Vault, our deep understanding of our two-sided network and the development of proprietary AI models. I couldn't be more pleased with the initial rollout of PayPal Complete payments. Our PSP merchant solution for channel partners and the SMB market. We are seeing tremendous interest in the platform with a substantial pipeline of completed sales and a backlog of deals that continues to grow. Importantly, our major channel partners are enthusiastic about its capabilities. We have already implemented PPCP, with leading channel partners like Adobe, LightSpeed, Recurly, Shift4, Shopify, Stacks Payments, UltraCare, Wix and WooCommerce with more than 25 additional channel partners scheduled to be live by the end of the year. This not only demonstrates the strength of our platform capabilities but will also enable a meaningful number of SMB merchants to access our latest checkout experiences. There is a remarkable sense of energy, excitement and enthusiasm among our leadership teams as we see clear and distinct signs of reinvigorated success in the market. We are now able to take advantage of many of the investments we have made over the past years to deliver a best-in-class experience for our customers, leveraging a modern infrastructure and our scale in the age of AI. We have successfully recruited a large number of external talent to complement our internal teams in both AI and machine learning as well as throughout our product, engineering and technology groups in order to build upon our success and maximize our opportunity. I'd like to end my remarks talking about our CEO succession plan. We are in the very final stages of the process. with several outstanding candidates, all of whom are highly qualified and excited to lead PayPal as we go into our next chapter of growth. I'm eager to welcome PayPal's next CEO to work with them on a seamless onboarding and to support them in the amazing PayPal team as I transition to my role on the Board. As you can hopefully tell, we have a lot of energy and confidence that we are on the right path with good momentum. Many of the headwinds we faced are now turning into tailwinds. We are executing with a high degree of excellence. We have a firm handle on our business model and can point to numerous successes already making a real difference in the market, which will only continue to compound over time. PayPal is in an increasingly strong position, and we are poised to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, let me turn the call over to Gab. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serving our customers and executing our priorities. PayPal delivered another solid quarter in a dynamic environment. We're reporting revenue at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share consistent with our expectations. Our results are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations. We continue to invest in our key initiatives, while demonstrating discipline in delivering on our operating expense commitments. In June, we were delighted to share more about our long-term strategic plan and product road maps at our investment community meeting. Importantly, the product launches we discussed are on track, and we continue to gain conviction in our ability to accelerate our branded checkout volumes and drive greater profitability across our PSP services. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce a multiyear agreement to sell both our existing European Buy now Pay Later receivables as well as future originations to KKR. During my remarks, I will discuss the impact of this externalization on our financial results. We have also included additional details in our investor update presentation. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis and 7% at spot to $7.3 billion. Transaction revenue grew 5% to $6.6 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and PayPal branded checkout. Headwinds to growth in the quarter included the lapping of $75 million in contractual compensation from merchants last year, which was de minimis this year, $72 million less in hedge gains relative to Q2 last year and the impact from migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Other value-added services revenue grew 37% to $731 million. This performance was predominantly due to increased interest income on customer store balances and to a lesser extent, revenue growth from consumer credit products. In the second quarter, U.S. revenue grew 9% and international revenue increased 5%. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue increased 7%, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year. Transaction take rate declined 11 basis points to 1.74%. Approximately two thirds of this decline was driven by a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility, a decline in gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue and the headwind from lapping elevated contractual assessments from merchants last year. While merchant mix continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate, the second quarter was an improvement from Q1. Our total take rate declined 6 basis points to 1.94%, affected by the same factors as transaction take rate. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 94 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q2 last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in Braintree volumes, partially offset by rate benefits in core PayPal and Venmo. Overall, transaction expense dollars grew 16%. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, a 3.6 basis point improvement versus last year. Transaction loss dollars declined 25%. The decrease this year was primarily due to an atypical merchandise solvency last year, which drove a sizable loss in the second quarter with no comparable exposure this year. Our ongoing risk mitigation activities and mix of volumes also contributed to this performance. Credit losses were $112 million or 3 basis points of the rate of TPV. On a dollar basis, credit losses increased 65%. Provisions in the quarter were driven by a build of $146 million, partially offset by a $33 million reserve release from the reclassification of our European Buy now Pay Later portfolio to held for sale from held for investment. The operating income benefit from this release of reserves was entirely offset by the fair value discount on the portfolio classified as held for sale. The increased provisioning resulted from increased expected losses in our PayPal business loans portfolio as well as growth in our U.S. Paylater portfolio. Like the broader industry, we're seeing a normalization of our credit portfolio to pre \u2013 COVID delinquency levels across our consumer and PayPal working capital portfolio. That said, we have seen some deterioration in our business loans portfolio. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net credit receivables. And as we discussed last quarter, we have taken remedial actions to address this performance. We've tightened originations and have already seen improvement in new cohorts. We'll be managing the book with similar rigor as we move through the remainder of the year. As a result of designating $1.9 billion in pay later receivables to assets held for sale, we ended Q2 with $5.5 billion in net credit receivables, a 3.5% decline year-over-year and a 26% decline sequentially. The decline in receivables due to held for sale accounting also contributed to an increase in our reserve coverage ratio. This ratio increased to 10% from 7.8% in Q1. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 13% in Q2 relative to an increase of 30% in the second quarter of 2022. Transaction margin dollars grew 1% to $3.3 billion, and transaction margin was 45.9%. While our transaction margin declined in the quarter, the rate of decline slowed considerably from both Q1 and the second quarter of last year, and we're executing on our strategy to grow transaction margin dollars. We're encouraged by the progress we're making against our longer-term initiatives that will support improved transaction margin performance over time. Q2 marked the third quarter in a row that we've delivered meaningful expansion in our operating margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Ongoing discipline in managing our cost structure allowed us to more than offset transaction margin compression with operating expense leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, nontransaction-related operating expenses declined 11%, with reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories contributing significant leverage. Strong expense performance resulted in 20% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth in operating income that we've delivered in more than 2 years. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 228 basis points to 21.4%, which was slightly below the guidance we gave for the quarter. This is principally attributable to our credit portfolio, where we earned less revenue than expected and increased loss provisions. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 24% to $1.16, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $14.4 billion. The net cash outflows for originations of loans held for sale reduced cash flows from operations by $1.2 billion in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of negative $350 million. Later this year, when the sale of the European BNPL back book closes, the proceeds will be recognized in cash flows from operations and offset this decline. So while the timing of accounting treatment will affect the quarterly profile of our free cash flow, there is no change to our outlook for the year, and we continue to expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow. In the quarter, we completed $1.5 million in share repurchases. For the full year, we now expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our buyback program. Our recently announced credit externalization will help optimize our balance sheet and improve our capital efficiency. Given our desire to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our business, we've taken a more aggressive approach to share repurchases. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has declined 6%. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Dan shared, based on our results from the first half of the year, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year for non-GAAP operating margin expansion and earnings per share. In the aggregate, for the first and second quarters of 2023, we've delivered revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency-neutral basis. We expect revenue growth in the back half of the year to be in line with this performance, if not slightly ahead, given the momentum we're seeing in the business. In addition, we're on track to meet our expense guidance for the year and are committed to delivering at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We also continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.95, representing 20% growth from 2022. We're reiterating our full year guidance while absorbing incremental pressure from our credit portfolio, given strengthening business performance driven by checkout initiatives and our ongoing realization of productivity gains. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 8% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to approximately $7.4 billion at current spot rates. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.24, representing growth of approximately 13.5% at the midpoint of the range. In summary, we're proud of our solid operating results this quarter. PayPal's unique competitive advantages, including our portfolio of differentiated assets and our global scale and ubiquity continue to drive us forward. We're committed to investing in our core strengths and building PayPal for the future, and we're guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers. Our revenue momentum and customer engagement trends position us well to achieve our growth objectives this year and beyond. Given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on managing the things we can control and allocating capital with discipline to ensure we optimize for long-term value creation and resiliency. And with that, Dan and I are happy to take your questions. Sarah, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of . Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks a lot. I want to ask a question on e-commerce Health. And Dan, I know you talked about it upfront. We're just getting a lot of questions on the e-commerce industry in general. So you mentioned inflation easing should help. I'm curious about other trends like shift from services to goods like our economists are talking about, which I think would also be a tailwind for you versus an previously. Is this something you're seeing? Or maybe is that changing how you're thinking about the second half versus a quarter ago? It seems like there's some room for upsetting your outlook here given the exit growth rate and what you talked about for July? Thanks. Daniel Schulman : Tien-Tsin: E-commerce is definitely one of those. We see e-commerce growth accelerating. We think it is at least in the mid-single digits right now. That's substantially above what we thought when we entered the year where we thought it might be flat year-over-year. And I would say I've got a slight bias that, that will continue to accelerate. You've got a range out there from low of zero to high 10%. We think it's probably right in the middle of that, and we think it is being driven by a shift from travel and services into goods and to fashion, where coming into retail pieces of that. And clearly, as inflation cools, we would expect to see more discretionary spend rebound, and that will help drive e-commerce. So one of the headwinds we faced was e-commerce growth slowing. Now it's accelerating again, and that clearly will be meaningful for us. We're also seeing improvements, as Gabi mentioned, in cross-border. That's beginning to accelerate again. That's obviously a very meaningful thing for us because, one, our value proposition is perfect for cross-border. It's consumers buying from merchants that they don't really know, but they trust PayPal and make sure that, that payment will be protected for them. It's obviously extremely high-margin business for us, and that seems to be accelerating nicely right now. PPCP, which was a really important introduction for us for numerous reasons, could not have a better reception in the market. We've got tremendous momentum there. Braintree continues to go from strength to strength, and we're seeing a lot of our value-added services now start to take hold. I can talk about some of that later in the call. Somebody wants to ask about that. And obviously, branded checkout is accelerating. That 8% is the highest we've seen since the end of the pandemic. And -- we continue to expect to see that strengthen as we go through the year as many of our initiatives are really taking hold in the last quarter. We've got another 200-plus experiments that are going to happen in Q3. And so that's all adding to momentum. And I guess at the end of the day, what that's adding up to when we look at our Net Promoter Score, we're now at a 7-year high in that. And so there's clearly a lot of momentum in the business right now, and we just want to double down on that. So we do obviously feel a lot better today than we did 90 days ago. But I think that's just going to continue when you ask that same question a quarter from now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey, Thanks, guys. Revenue growth was obviously sound, but we still saw transaction profit dollars a little less pronounced versus revenue. I think it actually may have decreased a bit year-over-year. And so Gabriel, I know you talked about some one-time grow-overs and hedging differences. And I'm sure the mix between branded and branded continues to have an impact given the growth of Greentree. But if you could just help us understand the moving parts in the quarter and the trends in the second half as far as gross profit or transaction profit growth goes, that would be great. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : You bet. You bet, For the quarter, transaction margin dollars grew 1%, which is essentially in line with Q1. That said, when we look at the underlying performance of our business, we're very encouraged by the stronger results we're seeing. In my prepared remarks, I called out several items that created headwinds to growth in the quarter due to lapping. In addition, we actually had some benefits that we saw in the quarter as well from the release of reserves from held for sale reclassification as well as from lapping that large merchant exposure last year. And so when we adjust for all these items, both the benefits and the drag on a more normalized basis, we actually see transaction margin dollars in the quarter growing several points faster than the reported 1%. And what we're really encouraged by is the strengthening profile of the business. We're actually starting to see the benefits of our initiatives as we get through some of the noise from lapping, we do expect to see improving transaction profit growth. When we think about the back half in Q3, we'll still see some pressure on transaction margin performance. In Q4, we expect to see an improvement. And then over the longer term, our TM profile in the future will certainly be benefited by the acceleration in branded checkout by e-commerce acceleration by the improved cross-border trends that Dan referred to as well as from the value-added services that we're adding on the PSP side. Darrin Peller : That's really helpful. So it sounds like some of these initiatives are third, fourth quarter events, but they could move needle starting them. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : We expect to exit the year in a much stronger position from a TM trajectory than where we are right now. Darrin Peller : Okay. Very good. Thanks. Guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : I wanted to follow up on Darrin's question. I know that unbranded seems to be a drag or dilutive to margins right now overall, which is a little bit surprising given just kind of how margin structure tends to be throughout the industry. I know you've talked a little bit in the past about adding incremental services to unbranded that could improve that structural margin component in on branded. Can you talk a little bit about what that may look like, timing and if any of those initiatives are will play a role in improving the transaction margin that you're looking at for the latter part of this year? Thanks. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes. I'll take a crack at that, James. Thanks for the question. Our PSP business does continue to go from strength to strength. -- as we talked about our overall TPV was nearly 30% in the quarter. And that's despite, as Gabriel mentioned, deprecating some of our older PSP flows, things coming off of our PayPal Pro. We actually migrated about $5 billion of TPV from our legacy stacks onto PPCP in this past quarter. And so it's a bit of a drag in the quarter, but we're going to be done with that by the end of the year. And we continue to win marquee accounts in the business, whether that be booking.com, meta, Allstate insurance, these are big accounts that we are winning because winning PSP is a strategic imperative for us. It allows us to have our latest checkout experiences with the largest, most important merchants in the world across PayPal, Venmo and by now pay later. We captured 100% of the data flows, which really is feeding our AI engines. It's fueling what will be our next-generation checkout. And most importantly, it's fueling kind of our ability to have best-in-class authorities in the industry and the lowest loss rates in the industry. In terms of the higher-margin services that we're going to be putting out there, -- we are seeing a lot of traction on that right now. For instance, we are moving into in-store. That's always been an area of opportunity for us. We are now fully implemented with 20 marquee merchants in over 1,000 in-store locations, over 2,500 POS systems will continue to do quite well there and push significantly in that. We're making good progress in selling things like payouts, risk-as-a-service, disputes, automation. We're seeing our largest customers begin to adopt that right now, whether it be Chen or meta or Tiktok, really, these are some of the bigger clients that we have adopting our value-added services -- and I'll just give you one example. We just started doing orchestration in 6 additional LatAm countries with much higher margins and where we're doing that orchestration for our largest customers, we're seeing like a 190 basis point off rate improvement. So you're seeing kind of this win-win as we're doing this. And then, of course, PPCP, as it goes down market is a much higher margin product for us. Yes, I talked about all of the channel partners that have already implemented that or in the middle of implementing, and we've got another 25 more partners by year-end in the U.S. another 15 EU partners by year-end. So we're seeing a tremendous amount of scaling on that. We've also enabled here in the U.S. 1.2 million SMB merchants to basically do a one-click migration into PPCP, -- we've already done all the risk assessment for them. They're on the right platforms for us to be able to seamlessly transition them onto that platform. So I think we're going to see a large amount of volume moving into PPP. That's obviously higher margin, high value-added services on branching will also help. And those will develop over time. Clearly, every quarter, they will add and some cumulative total will start to feel as we kind of exit the year and certainly as we go into 2024 with that. I hope that helped... James Faucette : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El Assal : In terms of operating margin performance, were there any factors besides credit that had a bigger impact than you expected in Q2? And then separately, can you just talk about the overall health of the credit business? Give us more color on the steps you're taking to maybe manage it a little bit differently. It sounded like that was the plan. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Absolutely. So for the quarter, we expanded our operating margin by about 228 basis points to 21.4%. This was a slight miss to our guidance of approximately 22%, and it was predominantly driven by increased pressure from PayPal business loans. There's no other items that really contributed to that miss. Overall, PayPal business loans was about a 90 basis point drag to transaction margin and to operating margin, and this is approximately 2x what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. So it really was a real impact -- as it relates to our broader credit business, we're in a really good position. Like the rest of the industry, we're seeing some reversion back to pre-covid levels of performance. But across our diversified portfolio of consumer and merchant credit, we're seeing relatively stable delinquency and charge-off trends The largest growth area for us continues to be our Buy-Now-Pay-Later solutions, where our performance continues to be very strong. Of course, going forward, given our partnership with KKR, the majority of the originations are going to be funded off-balance sheet for us, and we'll be able to support the sustained growth of that business. On the PayPal business loan side, this is really the part of our portfolio where we have seen deterioration. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net receivables. We've historically seen consistently strong performance in this book. And last year, we widened the credit box and the performance has not been within our expected risk appetite. We've taken steps to improve performance. We significantly tightened originations. Today, the book is down about 30% in total receivables, and we expect this pressure to continue through the back half of the year, but then really to abate as we move into next year. That said, the overall strength of our business and the momentum we're seeing is allowing us to maintain our operating margin and EPS guidance for the year while we're absorbing this credit pressure. Ramsey El Assal : Thanks so much, VERY helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to come back to branded TPV growth. So you had 6.5% in the month of June. You were over 8% in July, you're expecting further acceleration during the balance of the year. So can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of and the visibility on that ongoing improvement? Like how much of it is better macro? How much is traction with PayPal's own branded checkout initiatives and which among those branded checkout initiatives is moving the needle most materially here in 2023? A - Daniel Schulman : I'll take a crack at that, Jason. Thanks for the question. It's an important one we are really pleased, obviously, to see branded checkout accelerate like it is. And we have good confidence that the initiatives that we're putting into place are going to continue to drive that growth. As I think about what is driving that growth. It's hard to delineate exactly what is happening because of macro, in terms of e-commerce, improving in general, as I mentioned, to Tianjin's first question around e-commerce and what is due to our initiatives, but we are clearly putting a lot of time, effort and resource into improving the checkout experience. And my adds off to that entire checkout team for all that they've done here. And I say, look, first of all, as e-commerce is growing, we're going to grow with it because we are clearly one of the market leaders, if not the market leader in digital payments around that. We do have a scale advantage over anybody in terms of 30 million-plus merchants that we have out there, 80% of the top 1,500 Internet retailers. We have a performance advantage in checkout up to 600 basis points better in auto rates than the industry average. And we have a trust advantage. When small businesses put PayPal on their site, they see their online sales go up by almost 44%. So those are things that we are building upon. But as we mentioned in our Investor Day on June 8, we've -- the amount of acceleration in the amount of innovation we're putting into the market has improved dramatically. -- we did 100 A/B tests in the first quarter. We did 200 A/B tests and incremental 200 in the second quarter. We're going to do another $200 million coming here in the third quarter. And in general, about 30% or so of those AB tests that we run actually create positive benefit coming out of them. What that means is we're going to have like 150 or so improvements in checkout in our digital wallets running through our metrics as we go through. And some of those are 1 or 2 basis points difference. Some of those can increase DPA by 10 or 15 basis points. And when you put all of those together, it's extraordinarily powerful, and we are definitely seeing that in our results. We also are beginning to see a lot of our merchants move to our latest integrations. We know that when we're native in app on the mobile that we hold or gain share. We talked like a quarter or 2 ago, about 33 of our top 100 merchants had our latest checkout integrations, and we had an aspiration to be at 50 by the end of the year. I'm pleased to report that now 43 of our top 100 merchants are on our latest checkout integration. So we're making really good progress around that. We're not -- we're not about doing just like the basics. We are approving availability. Latency has now improved by 45% year-over-year. Every couple of milliseconds increases conversion rates on that. And passwordless is really important for us. And the rollout of Pass keys, some other authentication methodologies that we're using now ex the EU, which has SCA strong customer authentication, we're at about 70% of our checkouts that are passwordless. That's going to continue to go up as we push tasks, and we're now taking Paskes into the EU, which will be very beneficial because you can actually take out the friction of SCA in those conversions as well. And so we're going to push that really hard. And then you see all the other big initiatives that we're doing, the pre-introduction preapproved amount for buying -- by the way, in the U.S., we've rolled that out to 60 million of our customers. We are seeing 25% to 30% increase in first-time users of Buy -- now Pay Later and those are using it 5% to 10% more in terms of the overall TPV than those that didn't have the preapproved amounts. And we're going to roll out another $50 million preapproved into the EU beginning of this quarter. We're taking our rewards up, our rewards and cash back. We saw a 20% increase in the number of people using it from Q1 to Q2. We're now up over 10 million people using our rewards when they use our awards, their TPA goes up by 32%. So these are some of the things that we're doing that are making a big difference. We've got a lot of things planned for Q3, and we're beginning to see it in the results and hope to be able to continue to point that out and continue to highlight what we hope to be increased growth in branded checkout. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Could you provide an update on your cost takeout plan for 2023, the progress you've made? And do you have any preliminary thoughts quantifying how OpEx reductions will carry into 2024? A \u2013 Daniel Schulman : Yes. Thanks, David. I'll start and then probably Jens will jump in on this. Look, we're going to continue to do surgical discipline in our cost structure. -- down 11% and in Q2 for the full year. We still expect that to decline consistent with what we talked about by 10%. And therefore, when we think about our operating margin expansion coming up by at least 100 basis points and some of that incremental pressure that we're absorbing on the credit side that as Gabi mentioned, we'll kind of move through our numbers by the end of the year. You're obviously seeing growing margin expansion driven by some of the top line enhancements we're doing not just the cost discipline that we've demonstrated. I would just say that this is not just about efficiencies, but this is about doing things faster and accelerating the velocity of our innovation. -- it's not about trade-offs. It's about lower cost, but higher performance. And you're seeing that because I look at our MBS being at 7-year highs. Look at the amount of innovation that we're now pumping through the system right now. We're getting more done more efficiently. There's no question that AI is going to impact every single company and every function just as it will inside of PayPal. And we've been experimenting with a couple of hundred of our developers using tools from both Google, Microsoft as well as Amazon. And we are seeing 20% to 40% increases in engineering productivity. Just imagine that in terms of how much more product we can get into the market and how efficiently we can do that. And I think we've always known and anticipated that AI will drive productivity improvements really for foreseeable future. But I think the exciting more unexpected result is that we think it's going to transform our value proposition as well. things like enabling us to look into all of our transactions, look at early fraud metrics to be able to feed that back to customers with early fraud alerts that assured them that we are protecting them, enabling them to add more and more financial instruments to us as well that we can protect this PayPal assistant that's going to -- that's really an AI chatbot. We've been using it internally inside our consumer app. It's pretty amazing what it can do. Obviously, our advanced checkout, things like customized rewards. So AI is going to be a thing that not only drives productivity improvements for us, but really importantly, value proposition improvements for us. And so we're surgical on our cost thing. We've been very disciplined in it. We're quite pleased with it, and I think we'll see productivity improvements over the years to come. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yes. As Dan said, we're on track for a 10% decline in our other OpEx for the year. The first half is down kind of low double digits, call it, 11.5%, 12%. In the back half of the year, of course, we begin to lap some of the cost savings that we began to take out last year. And so the decline in other OpEx declines a bit, and so we'll be in sort of the high single digits then, building on what Dan said, just around delivering better experiences to our customers and the productivity gains, it's also coming from the platform migration and consolidation work that we're doing. And that too allows us to scale more efficiently over time. And so you should expect to see us continue to look for ways to deliver better experiences to our customers and scale them efficiently on our platform. Operator : Your next question comes from the line. Sorry, we have time for one last question, and it comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Question here. I wanted to ask about the consumer value prop and a big piece of that is going to be the wallet and the enhancements of the wallet, including offers. Can you just talk about some of the initiatives you're doing there that's going to improve the digital wallet going forward? Daniel Schulman : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, increasing the number of consumers who use our digital wallet. It's one of our most important initiatives because we feel it's going to drive both engagement ARPA, monthly active users -- the app user today, the typical app user has a 35% greater ARPU, 60% greater TPV and 25% less churn. And so the more we can put on that, the better and about 55% of our base today uses the app, just to give you an idea of that. And the app to your point, is designed to -- it's designed to enable the full shopping experience from discovery, which is like the deals and offers that you just mentioned to flexible payments, the widest array of funding choices, things like biop later, split tender that enables you to utilize 2 different funding sources to buy your purchase to post purchase, which includes package tracking and returns management, refunds directly into your PayPal wallet. I won't go in again to all the experimentation we're doing, but you can see kind of the tremendous amount of velocity there. The new features that are coming into the wallet include this early fraud alert. We've scaled that now to 10% and that's really designed to protect our customers. We can see fraudulent signals well before others. We can let a consumer know that their card has been compromised. We can simultaneously let the FI know so that card can be reissued instantaneously. And so we're seeing early but really positive response to consumers from this, and it causes them to defend these alerts that come that causes them to open the app, the more they open the app, the more they do with us. I think I mentioned on the rewards cashback that will be something that we'll be putting some resource into because we're seeing a tremendous interest in it. These users are up 20% quarter-over-quarter and the is gigantic improvement. As I mentioned, about a 32% improvement on that. Package tracking, we're now 100% ramped across iOS and Android. It scrapes basically your Gmail account to look for any of your e-commerce orders. They don't even have to be through PayPal. We consolidate them all into one place into our PayPal app. We're seeing a 20% app engagement uplift for those who sign up for that, a 10% improvement in TPA. Things like savings, that's now at a 4.3% interest rate. When somebody does that, their ARPA goes up $26 and they're logging to the app is up 16x those who don't have a savings account with us. I mentioned by not later preapproval, that's $50 million more to come this quarter in the EU. And we'll start things like our advanced AI checkout with our first clients later this year and our PayPal system using AI technology as well. Those are just some of the things to come. There's a lot of innovation. And as I mentioned, my hats off to the team because I think they're just doing a great job hitting their schedule, doing constant experimentation and really making our experiences much improved and moving towards best-in-class -- so thanks, everyone, for your great questions. I really appreciate it. I want to thank everybody for your time, and we look forward to speaking to all of you later. So take care. Thank you. Daniel Schulman : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. +",

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. And with that, let me turn the call over to Alex. Alex Chriss : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you all on today's call, my first as President and CEO of PayPal. Before I dive in, I'd like to take a moment to thank my predecessor, Dan Schulman, for his diligence and professionalism and handing over the reins and helping me onboard quickly. Additionally, I'm very excited to welcome Jamie Miller to PayPal as the company's next Chief Financial Officer. Jamie will officially be joining PayPal on November 6. Jamie is a world-class CFO who joins us with decades of experience in both senior finance and operations roles at a number of different Fortune 100 and private companies, including GE and Cargill, and was most recently, CFO of EY. Jamie is a vital addition to our team. Under Jamie's leadership, I have no doubt that we will drive the financial discipline, necessary efficiencies and operational excellence our company requires. I look forward to introducing Jamie to you over the coming months and you will also hear from her, of course, on our next earnings call. As excited as we are to welcome Jamie, I also want to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to Gabrielle for all of her hard work, dedication and passion as interim and then acting CFO. She has helped to drive the company forward and has been instrumental in helping me get up to speed over the past couple of months. I truly appreciate her partnership as well as her commitment to PayPal and look forward to working with her during this next chapter of PayPal's journey. Okay. Let's jump in. When I was asked by the Board to take on the CEO role, I was so energized by the possibilities of the impact PayPal can have on the world. I've dedicated the last 19 years of my career to fighting for the underdog, helping consumers and small businesses around the world, achieve their dreams interact with each other and build a better life. PayPal takes that mission to a whole new level. The assets, the data, the scale and the brand, the full foundation of what PayPal sits on today is unrivaled. And for me, that is the opportunity of a lifetime. I am also walking in eyes wide open. There are clearly challenges to tackle. I am someone who speaks plainly and transparently. If we are doing things well, I will highlight them. If there are things we can do better and need to fix, then I will have no hesitation in calling those out too. Our innovation activity has accelerated. But we still have work to do on maximizing our impact for our customers and results. Competition and complexity have increased and the company's focus has not been clear. We are doing a lot of things, but are refocused enough with our resource allocation. Are we executing with excellence behind the most important work to provide customers with a compelling and differentiated value proposition? Are we partnering with customers in a way that brings them deep value, but also rewards the PayPal shareholder? These are questions I am maniacally focused on answering with the team and doing a better job of executing across the board. But let me be clear, notwithstanding those realities, this is a growth company with great prospects. Even within the first month on the job, I'm more energized and have more conviction and clarity than I expected over how we win. We have significant opportunities for growth and impact, the foundation is strong, and the value pools and growth vectors are there. We must simply execute better and with higher velocity, and we will. I'd now like to share with you all my onboarding process, and what I've learned and observed so far, then I will describe changes you will see going forward, and lastly, I'll set expectations for what you will see from us over the next few quarters. While I've only been here a little over four weeks, I've been conducting in-depth conversations with internal and external stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners and investors, and diving into the business with our products and go-to-market teams. The feedback has been encouraging, exciting, revealing and very clear. There are two lenses I've had in synthesizing the input. First, how do we differentiate in solving the most critical customer problems. Second, what are our unique growth vectors and how do we accelerate our impact for customers and shareholders. Before I run through my thoughts after 30 days, first, let me say, I've been surprised and delighted with how consistent and clear the answers to the previous questions have become. We are not searching for ideas for tremendous growth. Our assets and our position in the market are incredible. We know exactly what needs to be done. We simply must execute. To give you some additional context, here are a few of my initial observations. On our employees. Our people are kind, caring, dynamic, innovative and engaged. They care deeply about our customers and one another, and are energized by our mission. My focus is to clearly define our mission, vision and purpose and unleash this team to execute a clearly defined and durable strategy. We will establish and refocus systems and processes to galvanize the entire organization behind our purpose and growth outcomes. On our customers and innovation, I generally see our customers falling into three categories : consumers; small businesses; and large enterprises. When looking at our customers through this lens, each segment has unique assets and a multitude of growth opportunities. I've been encouraged by how much innovation our teams are delivering, but we have an opportunity to, a, focus our teams on what's most important to these customers, and, b, package our innovation in a way that is clear and differentiates us in the market. Let me give you some examples. For consumers, we have not only tremendous breadth, mind share and wallet share of our consumers, but these are active and engaged users. In the U.S. alone, over 70% of the adult population has use PayPal in the past five years. Let me say that again. Over 70% of adults in the U.S. have used PayPal in the past five years. And with the recent launch of our Venmo Teen Account, we are now seeing adoption of our core products and services across the entire addressable market in the U.S. Additionally, we've innovated with unique products and experiences for consumers that each on their own provide tremendous customer benefit. For example, our PayPal Cashback Mastercard provides 3% cashback on PayPal purchases as well as cashback on all other purchases. Customers with this card make on average 56 more purchases with PayPal in the year after they adopt the product than they did the year before. Over 25 million consumers have used PayPal Rewards in the past 12 months, and we've put more than $200 million back in our customers' pockets, with cashback and savings during that time. But even more interesting, through our Rewards product, we have an active database of over 300 million SKUs of inventory from our merchant partners. These data points can help us use AI to power a robust shopping recommendation engine to provide more relevant rewards and savings back to our customers. We've just begun and already rolled-out passkeys to more than 10 million consumers globally to reduce friction in the sign-in experience. We've added additional security features by providing fraud alerts for all your cards in the PayPal Wallet. We're gaining ubiquity both online and in-person as our PayPal and Venmo branded credit and debit cards can now be added in the Apple and Google Wallets. And we've launched the first regulated stablecoin by a global payments company in PYUSD, connecting our PayPal and Venmo ecosystems together and creating one of the most robust peer-to-peer networks in the world. Individually, these are each incredible innovations. But we have not yet brought them altogether into a cohesive, integrated and seamless customer experience and value proposition. As I've said at the beginning, we have brand awareness and reach consumers in most markets around the world. They know PayPal and they are rooting for us. It is our responsibility to now put together these innovations into a world-class seamless experience. And that is exactly what we're going to do. As an example, we have refocused our consumer product and go-to-market team to relaunch a brand new end-to-end consumer experience with Checkout at the center, that will bring value to consumers with every single purchase. We will make it abundantly clear why choose PayPal. This is the first core priority I've asked the teams to focus on. Next, for small businesses. The core customer problem we can solve is helping them get more customers. From a breadth and depth perspective, we again have tremendous reach. We serve approximately 35 million merchant accounts and the vast majorities are SMBs. We have recently launched our new PayPal Complete Payments solution in the market. This solution helps small businesses sell globally and accept a range of payments including PayPal, Venmo and PayPal Pay Later products to help drive checkout. We provide SMBs the tools to transact globally and are innovating for them with critical services, such as package tracking. Package tracking is now live with over 5,000 merchants on BigCommerce, WooCommerce and UltraCart. Early results show merchants are experiencing an 80% decrease in item not received disputes, 40% higher dispute wins and 65% faster funds release. This is a good start. But what really gets me excited is how all of our profile and payment data comes together to empower each of our merchants to improve their conversion rates via our next-generation checkout, while making our consumers checkout experiences more efficient. We just rolled this product out to a handful of pilot merchants. And with the breadth of our consumer coverage, we are able to identify the majority of consumers that visit a merchant's site. That means we can auto fill payment information for consumers and streamline guest checkout for our merchants. To serve small businesses with our best-in-class product, we must get PayPal Complete Payments to scale globally. This is the second core priority I've asked our product and go-to-market teams to rally behind. And you will see us with a concerted push to dramatically improve the end-to-end PayPal Complete Payments product rollout and adoption in the next couple of quarters. Once we've accomplished this, we will have earned the right to expand additional offerings to small businesses. As someone with deep experience scaling products and services for the small business segment, we have the right to play and win in a number of meaningful and durable businesses that will solve core customer problems and delight our users. Lastly, for our enterprise customers. We have proven that we can win in the market and take share with Braintree, serving the largest enterprises, such as Adobe, Booking.com, DoorDash, Ticketmaster and Uber. In the last 12 months, we processed over $450 billion in volume out of an estimated $4 trillion to $5 trillion of global large enterprise e-commerce. That's approximately 10% flowing through us. We now have a beachhead to build upon. We will address additional customer needs, such as payouts, fraud management, charge-back automation, and FX. These value-added services not only address specific customer pain points, but also help PayPal drive additional margin. To be clear, our focus here will be continuing to improve performance, provide additional services and expand margin revenue. And lastly, on our company as a whole. Let me touch briefly on our evolution to operating as a platform company. Our ability to seamlessly delight customers end-to-end is a function of the quality of our technology and data platforms, which are very strong. But we have a significant and important opportunity to further become a platform company that builds company-wide capabilities, accelerates at scale and drives efficiencies across the organization. Fully unlocking this will accelerate innovation, velocity in the market and value. Further, our data and scale are key strengths. Our machine learning capabilities combine hundreds of risk and fraud models with dozens of real-time analytics engines and petabytes of payments data to generate insights by learning users' behaviors, relationships, interests and spending habits. This scale gives us a very unique advantage in the market. Our ability to create meaningful profiles with the help of AI is exceptionally promising. You will see us using our data and the advances in generative AI in responsible ways to further connect our merchants and consumers together in a tight flywheel. This is essential. We must build products and customer experiences that are strengthened by our unique two-sided network. Harnessing an end-to-end data platform will help us drive network effects throughout our business. In order to maximize this opportunity, it will require technology consolidation and automation across the company. Simply put, our cost base remains too high, it is actually slowing us down. As such, I am in the process of evaluating our most profitable growth priorities and aligning our resources to those priorities. We will become leaner, more efficient and more effective, driving greater velocity, innovation and impact for customers. To recap my observations and focus areas, our assets and breadth are unrivaled. Our innovation is accelerating and will drive impact. But we must focus and execute. The weight of the organization will be squarely behind, one, reinventing our consumer experience to drive a clear and durable value proposition with checkout at the center; two, improving and scaling PayPal Complete Payments for small businesses globally; and three, driving margin expansion in Braintree and other products for large enterprises. Additionally, we will invest in our company-wide platform, driving efficiency and acceleration of innovation, while rightsizing our expenses. Now, I'd like to share what you can expect from me in terms of how we will communicate to all of you and the principles to which we will adhere. You will see this starting with our next earnings call in terms of how we report our numbers and what we view as important metrics to our shareholders. I believe in the last several years, it has been difficult to model our company consistently, because the company itself hasn't provided consistent metrics to allow you to do so. That is going to change. For our next earnings call, we will unpack for you the following. First, we will be clear what our operating principles are and how these principles drive the growth opportunities we pursue and, in turn, drive capital allocation, technology allocation and talent allocation decisions across our business. Second, we will be clear about what metrics matter the most to us and how we are managing the business. I can tell you right now what I care about most is high-quality customer growth and profitable revenue growth. Going forward, PayPal will be focused on generating real profit for the company. I can't emphasize that last statement enough. It is key to how I believe this company should be run, and it is how you should expect us to measure our performance. Unprofitable growth is counterproductive to the long-term prospects of this or any other growth-oriented company. Third, as a management team, we will be guided by margin-accretive revenue growth. Over time, I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to grow revenue outside of purely transaction-related volume as we continue to serve our customers' core needs. We are taking a closer look at how best to report our financial performance and which KPIs we will be focused on going forward. Once we complete this review, we will consistently use the same metrics. And it will be easy for you to model the business, judge our performance and hold us accountable. Next, I want all stakeholders to be able to understand in a simple way how we do what we do and how we make money doing it. This includes our customers as they are the lifeblood of our existence. Lastly, I am laser-focused on operating leverage and making sure we manage our cost base with relentless attention and commitment. As I've said before, I believe our cost base and complex structure is slowing us down. We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth, while reducing our expenses, helping further drive operating leverage. In terms of the timeline from here. I can tell you that we are already hard at work, determining a comprehensive plan for 2024 and ensuring we are prepared to delivering. There are teams stacked against the focus areas I mentioned earlier, and they are deep in execution mode. Our core execution and fast-twitch operating muscles are building by the day. In parallel, the leadership team and I are refreshing our strategic priorities and focus areas for 2024, and we'll be sharing them with you in our next earnings call in February. I will unpack for you then the clarity of our strategic focus, our focused growth priorities and how we will achieve durable profitable growth, adjustments we will make to drive efficiencies across the organization, and guide what you can expect us to deliver in 2024. It is clear to me that the things we need to do better aren't all going to be achieved overnight. And, of course, business, like life, is not a straight line. However, I can tell you one thing for sure. We are going to move at lightning speed to get there as quickly as possible. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Gabrielle to take you through the Q3 results, and then we would be happy to take some questions. A - Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Thanks, Alex. It's great to have you on-board. The past few weeks have been incredibly inspiring and invigorating. There is renewed energy and excitement at PayPal, with you leading us forward. I look forward to welcoming Jamie and working with you as we enter this new chapter of growth for PayPal. I share Alex's enthusiasm for our increased pace of innovation and the outstanding opportunities we have given the power and scale of our global franchise. And I agree that with increased focus and improved prioritization, accelerating our growth and delivering operating leverage are mutually reinforcing. Importantly, we're committed to increase transparency and improve consistency in how we discuss our business and the ongoing enhancement of our disclosures. I would also like to thank the entire PayPal team for their steadfast focus on delivering for our customers and executing our priorities. First, several highlights from the quarter. We're reporting 9% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis and 20% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, both of which are ahead of our guidance. In the third quarter, we again demonstrated strong expense discipline and our ability to operate our business with improved efficiencies. In addition, we continue to make progress in the quarter across our long-term strategic initiatives, which are focused on driving more profitable growth. Moving to our customers. We're encouraged by new cohorts coming in. Retention and active use based on product innovations are starting to pay off. That said, during the quarter, active accounts declined by 2.8 million as we continue to flush out low-quality customers, predominantly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. As a reminder, we said this would be a year where we churn off lower-quality actives and, in which, total accounts would decline. Year-to-date, churn has been lower than our expectations. Customer growth is a vital pillar of our growth agenda. We're an organization focused on serving our customers and improving our value proposition, and we're positioning ourselves for a return to growth in our customer base. Turning to volume growth. We're reporting total payment volume of $387.7 billion, representing 15% growth at spot and 13% growth on a currency neutral basis, with that growth primarily driven by Braintree. U.S. TPV grew 10%. International TPV grew 19% currency neutral, accelerating 5 points sequentially, primarily driven by strength in Europe as well as improvements in Asia. I would now like to comment on our branded checkout performance. PayPal's global branded checkout volumes grew approximately 6% in the quarter on a currency neutral basis, relative to 7.5% growth in Q3 last year. Growth accelerated in July to 8%, but moderated as we moved through the quarter. To date in Q4, branded trends have stabilized and are tracking in line with the first half of the year. As I mentioned, revenue increased 9% on a currency neutral basis and 8% at spot to $7.4 billion. Transaction revenue grew 7% to $6.7 billion, driven by Braintree and PayPal branded checkout. Hedge gains for the quarter were $7 million, $149 million lower than Q3 last year. In Q3 of last year, we also benefited from approximately $75 million in contractual compensation from merchants, which did not contribute to our revenue this year. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services was also a drag on the growth in transaction revenue. Other value-added services revenue grew 25% to $764 million, almost entirely driven by increased interest income on customer store balances. In the third quarter, U.S. revenue grew 7%. International revenue increased 10% at spot and 11% on a currency neutral basis, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year. As with TPV, we saw strengthening performance across Europe, which was most pronounced in the early to mid-summer, and in China, our seller business improved as well. Transaction take rate declined 13 basis points to 1.72%. Similar to our Q2 results, approximately 70% of this decline was driven by three factors : lower gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue; a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility; and the headwind from lapping elevated contractual compensation from merchants last year. In addition, the mix of volumes from large merchants continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate. Our total take rate declined 12 basis points to 1.91%, and was affected by the same factors as transaction take rate. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 93 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q3 last year. This increase was primarily driven by Braintree volume growth and was partially offset by the geographic mix of PayPal volumes and rate benefits in Venmo. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, flat to last year. Credit losses were $117 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 21% in the third quarter. Consistent with our expectations going into the quarter, Q3 saw a higher level of pressure on transaction margin dollar and rate performance due to several lapping and more transitory factors that we've discussed on past earnings calls. Transaction margin dollars declined 3.5% to $3.4 billion, and transaction margin declined 558 basis points to 45.4%. In the third quarter, we delivered 540 basis points of operating expense leverage. Non-transaction related operating expenses declined 12%. We've been actively managing our cost structure. And in Q3, reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories contributed significant leverage. Non-GAAP operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $1.6 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin declined 18 basis points to 22.2%, with operating expense leverage largely offsetting transaction margin compression. For the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 20% to $1.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.06. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15 billion. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, which represents a 30% decline from the third quarter last year. As a reminder, last quarter, we classified the European installment loans that we intended to sell to KKR as held-for-sale. All loans subsequently originated in this portfolio are also classified as held-for-sale and are reflected as outflows within cash flow from operations. In Q3, this dynamic reduced free cash flow by $810 million. In future periods, we will recognize the cash from proceeds of sales as an offsetting inflow to cash flow from operations. Adjusting for this temporary impact, free cash flow grew 21% to $1.9 billion. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation are competitive differentiators and provide us with significant optionality for value creation. We have also made progress this year, executing a disciplined approach to capital allocation and managing our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we completed an additional $1.4 billion in share repurchases. Through September 30, we've now returned $4.4 billion to shareholders. For the full year, we continue to expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our share repurchase program. Given our conviction in our business, relative to its valuation today, we've taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program and have reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by 7% over the last eight quarters. We believe that share repurchase remains an optimal use of capital, allowing us to retain the flexibility to continue investing opportunistically in our business. In addition, as a result of our decision to sell our European Pay Later receivables to KKR, we ended Q3 with $5 billion in net credit receivables, a 16% decline year-over-year and a 9% decline sequentially. Two weeks ago, we closed on the first step of this commitment, receiving approximately $1.4 billion in proceeds. Later this month, we will close on the next tranche of our back book sale of credit receivables. We are also maintaining a tightened origination strategy for the PayPal business loans portfolio. Principal and interest receivables declined nearly 30% in the quarter, and this portfolio now represents approximately 12% of our overall credit receivables portfolio versus 21% 12 months ago. As you heard from Alex, we're evaluating our growth priorities and aligning our resources to accelerate our velocity and [Technical Difficulty] with greater focus, we can be more effective. Consistent with this approach, we're divesting Happy Returns. In September, we entered into an agreement to sell Happy Returns to UPS for $465 million in cash, meaningfully higher than our acquisition price. We're thrilled that following a rigorous process over many months, our team was able to find Happy Returns the right long-term home with UPS. This sale, which is expected to close in the current quarter, will enable us to put even more focus on our core business and priorities. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Relative to the plan laid out on our earnings call three months ago, branded checkout growth has been lower than expected. As I mentioned earlier, after an acceleration in the summer, we've seen a return to growth that is more in line with trends throughout the first half of 2023. We now expect fourth quarter revenue to grow between 7% and 8% on a currency neutral basis or approximately 6% to 7% at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP EPS in Q4 to be approximately $1.36, representing 10% growth relative to 2022. Our guidance contemplates a sequential improvement in transaction margin dollar performance. That said, on a year-over-year basis, we now expect transaction margin dollars to decline. In addition, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to contract from the fourth quarter last year. For 2023, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 8.5% on a currency-neutral basis and approximately 7.5% at spot. The ongoing strength of Braintree volumes in conjunction with lower-than-expected branded checkout trends are resulting in incremental pressure on our non-GAAP operating margin. Relative to the 100 basis points of expansion previously expected, we now expect approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion. We're slightly increasing our expectations for full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS, which we now expect to be approximately $4.98, representing 21% growth from last year. This increase reflects the benefit of Q3 outperformance and changes to our tax rate assumption. In addition, we now expect free cash flow for 2023 to be at least $4.6 billion. In closing, we believe that we're well positioned to navigate the road ahead. As Alex noted in his comments, we're working on our plans to accelerate profitable growth, and we'll share our progress with you along the way with consistency and transparency. We're committed to building PayPal for the future and guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers. Backdrop continues to be complex. We're taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business. And with that, Alex and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey. Thanks so much. And Alex, appreciate your observations and priorities here. Can you maybe share a little bit more on your early impressions of the assets and the portfolio products at PayPal? I'm -- just love to hear what surprised to the upside and maybe what assets could require more work to turn around than what you thought? And if -- for example, Happy Returns being sold, as you called out last week, we see more sales, divestitures, replatforming, that kind of thing. Thank you. Alex Chriss : Yeah. Thank you, Tien-Tsin, and good to hear from you. It's been exciting to come in. If I would be remiss if I didn't say it wasn't a surprise, but it's delighted me from an asset perspective. The first I'd highlight is our employee base. This is a tremendous team that is energized, has welcomed me to the team and is fired up to go tackle all the opportunities ahead of us. If I then think about the different components, I've been really impressed with all the different pieces that we have to deliver for our consumers. We have a ubiquitous platform that's globally recognized with PayPal. Venmo is a verb, and it's something that is tremendous in the U.S. and has opportunities beyond. If I think about all the different core problems that we can solve with the assets that we have for customers, Rewards, Buy Now Pay Later, cashback cards, all of those are tremendous and within our grasp. We just, as I mentioned earlier, just have to put them together into a core value proposition, and that's what the team is working towards right now. On the merchant side, again, we have tremendous penetration into small businesses and enterprises. We have a beachhead now with Braintree, which I'm really excited about. And I think we've earned the right now to expand margin and make sure that we're really pricing to value and ensuring that we're delivering what we need to across the board. And then, if I really think about the biggest surprise that I didn't realize before coming in is probably around the data. When we look at the data that we have across this two-sided network, it allows us to do things that I think others just can't. And when I think about how we can personalize branded checkout, how we can recognize people that checkout with our data and create an experience that is frictionless, that is personalized, that drives conversion for our merchants, I think we're just scratching the surface of the opportunity there. And so, that is a big opportunity that gets me very excited. In terms of opportunities where we have more work, I think you saw it with the Happy Returns divestiture. And what I would say overall is we have lots of opportunities, but we're doing too many things. We're spread too thin. And we have an opportunity to focus the organization on what matters the most, on the most impactful opportunities to customers and to growing the business, and we'll be looking at that over time. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Gabs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, Alex and Gabrielle. And I appreciate all the clarity you guys provided on your priorities. You gave us some great detail also on your approach to the SMB side of the business, such as some commentary on PPCP. I guess the question is, given your prior experience with SMBs, do you see SMB becoming a more important part of PayPal's strategy relative to the past? And I guess which areas of the product or innovation roadmap get you most charged up at this point? Alex Chriss : Yeah. Thank you, Ramsey. I -- small businesses are a passion of mine. It has been for the last 19 years and it's very personal. I used to run a small business, and so it's in my DNA and something that not only is important to PayPal and has been in the past, it's really been the lifeblood of the organization. But it absolutely will be a priority going forward. When I think about small businesses in general, there's two really core customer challenges that the small businesses have. The first is getting customers and growing their business, and the second is managing cash flow. On the getting customer side, we have a tremendous opportunity with PPCP to help them convert customers, to find customers, to drive new customer acquisition and really help them over time. This is a data play. It's a ubiquity play. And with our two-sided network, it's where we're focused right now. Once we do that, I think we earn the right to expand into their second challenge of cash flow. Cash flow was all about money in, money out and access to capital. We play in all three of those areas. We just have to put together the assets that we have to be able to help small businesses, again, manage their cash flow in a way that helps them grow their business and get past any ups and downs in the market. So, very excited about small businesses going forward. Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey. Thanks, guys. Alex, congrats again on the new role, and Gabrielle, thanks for everything. Obviously, we know you'll be missed by your investors. Guys, I know you lowered your outlook a bit for revenue in the fourth quarter, and I think you said you continue to see a decrease in gross profit for fourth quarter. Can you just give us a bit more color on what you're seeing in the environment on e-com, both U.S. and perhaps globally? And just if anything you're seeing in the trends is what led to a more cautious outlook either on the holidays or anything more broadly? Thanks, guys. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yeah, Darrin. You bet. Thanks for the question. Overall, I'd say we're seeing very healthy trends in our checkout business. We're heading into the heart of Q4, and we really see no meaningful shifts in our performance or our demand environment. We have taken an appropriately prudent approach to planning for Q4, and obviously, we've contemplated a range of outcomes. As you know, headed into Q3, we had expected to see branded checkout accelerate through the back half. Branded did bump up in July. And as I discussed a few minutes earlier, it moderated through Q3. Overall, we've seen very solid performance in branded. So, when we think about the sort of what we're seeing in the back half relative to the first half, very consistent performance in global branded checkout. But it's just not as elevated as we planned and that's really what's informing the outlook. Darrin Peller : Got it. Thanks, Gab. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Ng : Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for the question. First, Alex, congratulations on the new role, and Gabrielle, thanks for everything. I appreciate your comments around managing the cost base and it being too high. Could you just talk a little bit about how you think about balancing the need for investment versus efficiency? The company previously talked about the opportunity for OpEx to keep declining in the years ahead. Is that how we should think -- still think about the future? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. First, let me say, as I mentioned earlier, this is a growth company, and we are going to assess the focused priorities where we will invest in growth and we will make sure those are funded for success. And so, I think about that separately, then also being able to manage OpEx. On the expense side, we have an opportunity to continue to manage OpEx efficiently. We have a lot of acquisitions that we've done over the past few years. We have a lot of duplication and a lot of manual work that we have an opportunity to invest in automation. We have an opportunity to invest in a platform that allows us to build services that can be reused and leveraged across the organization, which will, again, as I mentioned earlier, actually accelerate us and speed the company up. So, I think about them differently. We will absolutely invest in growth and make sure that the levers that we have to continue to delight customers and grow the business are funded for success. And then, we will work on building a platform that drives automation and continues to drive down our cost base. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you for the thoughts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Good afternoon, guys. Alex, welcome. Gabrielle, best of luck. And I wanted to actually ask about the transaction profit dollar growth. In Q4, will that year-over-year decline be more or less than it was in Q3? And then, how should we think about the potential for this metric to see improved growth into 2024? Maybe you can comment on which of the initiatives that are in place to offer more potential than others to move the needle on transaction profit dollar growth next year? Thank you. Gabrielle Rabinovitch : Yeah. You bet, Jason. Maybe I'll start. Well, as you heard Alex discussed and I commented on it as well, our focus really is on driving profitable growth. And we're putting the weight of the organization against initiatives consistent with that objective. That said, we did see a decline in our Q3 transaction margin dollars. We do expect them to decline again in Q4, but to a lesser extent. So, I really view Q3 as the low point and we'd expect to see an improvement in the profile in Q4. In addition, obviously, we're not guiding 2024 on this call. Longer-term, our success will, in part, be determined by our ability to reaccelerate profitable growth in the business and we expect to be able to do that. Alex, anything else you want to add? Alex Chriss : I just -- I want to underscore, I know I've -- I said it in the comments and I just want to underscore it again. We have every opportunity to drive profitable growth. It's just a focus that -- and a discipline that we will bring to the organization. And so, it will take time. There will be a sequential performance improvement over a number of quarters. But when we make it the focus of the organization, we have enough levers at our disposal to be able to deliver on that. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you so much for the question. And I want to add my welcome to Alex and thanks to Gabrielle for all the work she's done in the CFO seat. One of the assets that you talked about within that population of the U.S. is Venmo. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about expanding its acceptance and kind of the to-dos around that? It seems like it's really important demographically. You have at least a foothold at Amazon, but expansion of acceptance elsewhere online especially has been pretty slow. So, just wondering how you're thinking about that as part of the asset pool and the to-do list there? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah. Thank you, James, for the question. And it is pretty rare to be able to have an asset as powerful as Venmo. When something, again, becomes a verb in language is a tremendous demographic. And you saw with our launch of Venmo Teen, we continue to expand the opportunity set there. As you mentioned, we're in early stages with Amazon. That is going well and we expect that both from a customer demand perspective as well as a merchant demand perspective, we will continue to drive acceptance ubiquity for Venmo. I think that is very important for us as well as just driving additional services that our customers are demanding for the Venmo app. And so, again, we think about providing different services, expanding the opportunity for our customers to be delighted and use Venmo for all aspects of their spending and managing of money. I think we're just, again, scratching the surface of what's possible with an app that is clearly loved in the market and has created viral growth. So, very excited to accelerate investment there and see where we can take Venmo. James Faucette : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Alex Chriss for closing remarks. Alex Chriss : Great. Thank you, Krista. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Hopefully, you can see how serious we are about growing and improving PayPal across the board as quickly as possible. Before we close, I want to leave you with three thoughts. You've heard in my voice today, both the confidence that we will make this company excel and the determination to do it as quickly and thoroughly as possible. We have an excellent business, but it needs to execute better and with greater clarity and focus, and it will. We will impact the go-to-market strategy and financial focus of the company in ways that are immediately impactful. It won't happen overnight, but we will get PayPal to the kind of consistent growth profile we all expect. As I've said it already, but it bears repeating one last time, what I care about is profitable growth. That is going to be our true north and receive our total focus. I've spent my entire career focusing on making sure we delight our customers and solve their most critical problems, but we must ensure we serve all our stakeholders. And lastly, our employee base is fired up and motivated to win in the market. In addition, you can also expect us to add additional senior talent to our team, who I believe can help significantly accelerate our growth trajectory. We are future-proofing this business and we know what needs to be done. We are playing to win. In the weeks and months ahead, we are going to be moving with velocity to deliver for our customers and our business. I look forward to talking to you all on our next call in February and laying out our clear plan to win. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter 2023. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ryan Wallace, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ryan Wallace : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining PayPal's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is Alex Chriss, our President and CEO; and Jamie Miller, CFO.  We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast. Both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.  Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website.  All information in this presentation is as of today's date, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. And with that, let me turn the call over to Alex. James Chriss : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. It's been a productive first 4 months. I'm pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in such a short period of time while delivering the solid financial results we will discuss today. More importantly, I'm excited about the foundation we're setting and the velocity at which we're executing as we enter 2024. Today, I'd like to walk you through the changes we've made to the structure of our company, including several key additions to our leadership team, give a clear road map for how we will be executing going forward and share our strategic priorities for 2024. Jamie will take you through the fourth quarter and full year results in greater detail, but the headline is that we delivered a solid quarter during the most important shopping season for our customers.  In Q4, we delivered 9% revenue growth on $410 billion in total payment volume. Transaction margin dollar performance was better than expected in the fourth quarter, and we continued strong expense discipline, reducing non-transaction-related expenses by 9% year-over-year.  Taken together with $600 million in share repurchases in the quarter, our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% year-over-year. While these are solid results, we know there is still much room for improvement, and we're committed to making the necessary changes to our business and how we invest and operate to get it right. One of the key changes I talked about in our last earnings call was ensuring we have an outstanding leadership team in place. It's important to me that we have a leadership team with a broad diversity of experience, deep operational rigor and leaders with track records of success. I'm thrilled with the talent that we've assembled in the last few months. With Jamie as our new CFO; Isabel Cruz, leading people in places; Michelle Gill, leading Small Business & Financial Services; Suzan Kereere, leading Global Markets; Diego Scotti, leading Consumer and Global Marketing and Communications, combined with talented leaders who have risen within PayPal, we have a world-class leadership team in place to help the organization reach its full potential.  Each of these leaders chose to join PayPal because they see the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us to reshape commerce and are already driving a renewed energy within the company. Second, we've organized our teams around the customers we serve, consumers, small businesses and enterprises. This creates clear lines of accountability and will enable teams to focus on delivering the right solutions that address our customers' greatest needs. Regardless of the customer we're serving, we want to make the PayPal offering so user-friendly, so rewarding and so integrated into a customer's life that PayPal is the obvious choice. Our new structure enables that.  Third, last week, we announced that we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 9% through both direct reductions and the elimination of open roles over the course of the year. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, our size has been slowing us down. While this was not an easy decision to make, this change is necessary to execute with the focus and speed required to drive our next chapter of growth and allow us to invest in our future. With these changes, we continue to reprioritize and invest in the innovation and delivery of products and solutions that offer the greatest impact for our customers.  The team has been very focused on building out our strategy and driving focused execution for 2024. These are the most important priorities we're focused on this year, accelerating growth in our branded checkout business, improving overall profitability, including that of our high-growth PSP services, unlocking the power of data to create more value for our customers while tapping into new sources of revenue and margin and operating more efficiently.  Our first look, customer announcement 2 weeks ago was an initial demonstration of the importance of delivering compelling value propositions to consumers and merchants. As promised, we're doing a lot of things to drive change internally and externally. However, nothing happens overnight. It will take time for some of our initiatives to scale and move the needle, but the initial customer reaction and merchant demand for our new innovations has been encouraging. 2024 is going to be a transition year, focused on execution to position the business for long-term success. Our clear goal is to reshape the company to accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion in the years ahead.  Prioritization will be key allowing us to move more quickly and with better results. Later in the call, Jamie will take you through our full year guidance. We have made strategic decisions to reinvest cost savings back into our most important initiatives. It is critical that we remain on offense and position ourselves to not only innovate but capture our share of the growth in global commerce. We want to be clear-eyed in terms of the potential near-term benefits from our initiatives, which is why our 2024 guidance includes minimal contribution from the innovations we recently announced. We want to see execution and clear results prior to embedding these initiatives into our financial outlook. As a company, we will build back a track record of delivering on our commitments. In November, I committed to being transparent with you all on how we will run the business. I want to spend a few minutes to share our operating principles and how we expect these will drive value creation over time. Our 5 operating principles are : number one, start with the customer. I believe in working customer back. We will start by defining our customers and their most critical needs. Then we will use that knowledge to inform everything we do, including investments and innovation.  Number two, focus on profitable growth. We will prioritize high-quality, profitable growth and driving improved transaction margin dollars through more rigor and discipline.  Number three, drive operating leverage over time. We will combine our assets and data to develop more personalized experiences for our customers and drive efficiencies across the business to leverage our cost base.  Number four, set measurable goals and communicate consistently. We say what we mean and mean what we say, we will be transparent and accountable for our performance; and number five, maintain a strong balance sheet. We will be diligent in managing our resources and returning excess cash to our shareholders. These 5 principles will guide how we make decisions and will ultimately keep us accountable to deliver what we say we will do. Let me now take you through what this means for how we serve our customers and what we're focused on in 2024. For enterprises, we're focused on accelerating growth in branded checkout and driving the profitable growth of our PSP services this year. Branded checkout is a critical part of PayPal's value proposition. We need to ensure we have our best checkout experience available to every consumer on every merchant every time. This will be a multiyear effort. To start, we've redesigned our branded checkout experience, creating more simplicity and consistency with the goal of optimizing presentment, increasing speed and minimizing friction across all major checkout flows. When combined with our efforts in password-less authentication, these new flows can result in up to an additional 50% drop in latency, allowing a shopper to check out twice as fast. Improvements like this are aimed at driving a higher selection rate of PayPal and better conversion for our merchants.  A challenge in the past has been bringing existing merchants on to our latest integrations and experiences. This is one of the reasons why our new guest checkout experience Fastlane by PayPal is so exciting. It's truly differentiated and will provide a compelling reason for merchants to operate. With it, we can recognize up to 70% of guests visiting a merchant, reduced checkout time by up to 40% and grow the top of our branded checkout funnel. BigCommerce, one of our long-time partners has already implemented Fastlane on their platform, and the conversion of their merchants using this new solution is as high as 79%. Combining solutions like Fastlane with a full suite of PSP offerings and more targeted, personalized commerce experiences creates a powerful end-to-end suite of capabilities that drive higher sales for merchants and gives them more reason to choose PayPal.  We're focused on driving profitable growth, including within our PSP services like Braintree. The team continues to earn market share and merchant confidence through product and performance enhancements, delivering auth rate improvements of up to 240 basis points for enterprise customers in the U.S. We're continuing to build out and seamlessly integrate additional value-added services in areas like orchestration, routing optimization, payouts and risk as a service in addition to serving as a seamless integration point for our latest branded checkout experiences, including PayPal, Venmo and Buy Now, Pay Later. We will be able to compete in the market with a best-in-class offering and price to value. In addition, we're putting greater discipline into our go-to-market and renewal processes as we focus on profitable growth. These areas take time to scale, but we're laser-focused on them and expect to make steady progress this year. For small businesses, we're on a journey to move from a variety of standalone products to a modern platform with a comprehensive suite of solutions. What this means in 2024 is that we're focused on accelerating the adoption of PayPal Complete Payments, or PPCP, through a reinvigorated go-to-market approach for partners and developers. This full stack solution enables us to distribute our best branded checkout flow to SMBs while also competing for the approximately $750 billion addressable market of processing volumes. We've had limited penetration of SMB full stack processing to date due to the lack of a strong product, but that is now changing.  November and December were record-setting months for new SMB adoption of PPCP. We're seeing lower churn rates for merchants on PPCP year-over-year, but we've also seen increases in transaction volume for merchants migrating to full stack processing from our legacy products. As the year progresses, we intend to drive additional adoption through partner channels, targeted marketing and developer-friendly capabilities like low- and no-code integration paths available through our brand new developer portal.  Over time, we want to better serve other important SMB needs, offering more ways to help them connect to new customers. It's also worth noting that all the checkout improvements I just discussed as part of our enterprise strategy can also benefit the tens of millions of SMBs that use PayPal. For consumers, we're focused on differentiating our value proposition, deepening existing relationships and giving shoppers more reasons to choose PayPal. PayPal already has strong consumer awareness and trust, but that is not enough to compete in today's world. Part of a person's decision to choose PayPal comes down to presentment, ease of use and speed, areas where we still have room to improve. We also want to give consumers more reasons to choose PayPal by delivering personal lines and rewarding shopping experiences that also drive higher conversion for merchants.  This year, we're launching and evolving a new PayPal app to create . We will also leverage our merchant relationships and the power of AI to make the entire shopping experience personalized for consumers while giving them control over their data. In addition, we will drive increased understanding and awareness of Why PayPal via sustained marketing efforts. Our goal is to drive quality customer growth over time as well as deeper relationships that include more frequent use and a greater range of product adoption.  The new checkout and app experiences we are rolling out this year will also create an engagement loop that will drive higher awareness of the various products we offer and drive higher adoption of our portfolio over time. Let me give you 2 examples of where we have significant opportunity to drive increased adoption. In the U.S., we have over 27 million active accounts using PayPal Rewards. In the fourth quarter, rewards accounts had higher engagement and average revenue per account that was almost double that of non-rewards accounts. The average revenue per account of someone who adopts the PayPal Cashback Mastercard is about 5x higher than the average checkout-only account.  Today, only about 2% of active accounts have that card in their wallet. Increasing adoption of these products will not only drive a richer experience for our customers but improvement in customer engagement and lifetime value for us. Redesigning our app and creating improved frictionless onboarding paths are tangible ways that we plan to drive higher penetration of these types of products. We're also bringing more functionality and better experiences to Venmo this year, like the ability to connect consumers with cash back offers from small businesses in their local communities. In addition to this innovation, we're focused on driving adoption of the Venmo debit card. Venmo debit card holders are among our most engaged accounts and drive 6x the incremental revenue than that of a P2P only customer, about 6% of our active Venmo customers have a Venmo debit card today.  So there is a significant opportunity there for us to focus on. Finally, this year, we will demonstrate meaningful progress towards operating more efficiently. We've already consolidated many disparate technology services into common platforms. So we have more work to unleash the power of our data in service of our customers. We're simplifying and automating manual processes and investing in tools and services needed to drive productivity and innovation velocity. This will reduce cost and complexity, improve the developer experience and give more reasons for customers to choose PayPal.  For example, we're converging to a single merchant reporting system, so that our merchants will get consistent and accurate reports, which will make a huge difference in how they run their business. Another outcome of consolidating platforms is that we will now see one view of the customer, which allows us to more effectively cross-sell the various products we offer. We will be moving at lightning speed and with the weight of the company behind each of these initiatives to deliver the best experiences possible for our customers this year.  To wrap up, I am pleased with our fourth quarter results and the execution that the team delivered throughout the quarter amid an enormous amount of change. I'm excited about the year ahead and all the innovation we have in store for our customers. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jamie to take you through our results for the fourth quarter and full year. Jamie Miller : Thanks, Alex. Good afternoon. First, let me say that I'm very excited to have joined PayPal. Our new leadership team is laser-focused on our customers, and I am incredibly energized to see our team come together to deliver PayPal's full potential. Before I discuss our financial results, you'll notice several things different in our materials today. First, we've redesigned our press release in a more standardized tabular format designed to allow ease of use and better consumption of information. We have also included additional supplemental metrics in our investor presentation intended to provide greater transparency into our business. We will continue to evaluate these and other changes over time.  I'll start with a summary of our financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we reported 9% revenue growth on a spot and currency-neutral basis. For the full year, revenue grew 8% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars were flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter and declined 1% for the full year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.48 in the quarter, representing 19% year-over-year growth. Higher earnings per share in the quarter were driven by ongoing expense discipline and better-than-expected transaction margin dollars, which benefited from branded checkout, Braintree and interest on customer balances.  We ended the full year with $5.10 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 24%. Our full year results benefited from lower operating expenses, the higher interest rate environment and the impact of share buybacks. Now I'll walk you through some key operating metrics that support these results. We ended the year with 426 million active accounts and 224 million monthly active accounts. Throughout last year, we indicated that we expected ongoing churn of unengaged accounts in less developed markets, predominantly in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region.  This was the primary driver of our year-over-year reduction in total active accounts. We had modest growth in monthly active accounts, up 1% for both the quarter and the full year, and our active base of engaged counts remain stable. More than 50% of our total active accounts were monthly actives over the course of 2023. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number, was 58.7 in the fourth quarter, up 14%. If we exclude PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree from that figure, transactions per active account grew 7%. Part of this growth rate is driven by the churn of unengaged accounts that I just mentioned, but we were also encouraged by the higher activity levels we're seeing among our core base of accounts. Page 14 in our investor presentation includes additional information on our historical trends in monthly active accounts and transactions per active account, excluding PSP processing. On volume growth in the fourth quarter, we saw total payment volume, or TPV, of $409.8 billion, representing 15% growth at spot and 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis.  This growth was driven primarily by Braintree as well as branded checkout and Venmo. U.S. TPV grew 11%, International TPV grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in Europe and improvement in Asia. For the full year, TPV was $1.5 trillion, increasing 13% at spot and 12% on a currency-neutral basis.  PayPal's fourth quarter global branded checkout volumes grew by approximately 5% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing full year branded checkout volume growth to 6%. We have seen a solid start to the year with consistent global branded checkout growth through January. PSP processing volumes grew 29% in the quarter, driven by ongoing growth in Braintree. The team continues to make product and performance enhancements for merchants. We are also putting greater discipline into our go-to-market and renewal processes as we focus on overall profitable growth.  With respect to revenue, as I noted earlier, revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $8 billion. Transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.3 billion, driven by Braintree and branded checkout. In the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue grew 8%. International revenue increased 10% at spot and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, accelerating from the third quarter.  Similar to TPV, we saw ongoing strength in Europe and improvements in Asia. For the full year, U.S. revenue grew 9% and international revenue increased 7% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a spot basis to $743 million. For the full year, other value-added services revenue grew 26% or by approximately $600 million. For both the quarter and the full year, this growth was driven almost entirely by increased interest income on customer stored balances.  Transaction take rate declined 10 basis points to 1.78% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 7 bps of this decline was driven by 2 factors : lower gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue and flat foreign exchange fees. In addition, mix shift with higher volumes from large merchants continued to have a slight impact on our branded checkout take rate. Transaction take rate for the full year was 1.76%, also down 10 basis points year-over-year. Transaction margin dollars were flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 3.5% decline in the third quarter. This approximate 4 percentage point improvement was driven by a combination of the absence of merchant contractual compensation in the prior year period and by branded checkout and Braintree.  The growth of interest income on customer stored balances and growth of branded checkout were the largest contributors to transaction margin dollars in the fourth quarter. This growth was offset by the absence of hedge gains compared to the prior year period as well as declines in other parts of the portfolio, including the impact of migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Fourth quarter transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 97 basis points, 4 basis points higher than the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by Braintree volume growth and was partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of PayPal volumes and rate benefits in Venmo.  Full year transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 94 basis points. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 7 basis points for the quarter, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter last year and 8 basis points for the full year. Credit losses were $119 million for the quarter or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV, down 32% year-over-year and 3 basis points as a rate of TPV for the full year. We have taken a prudent and active approach to managing our overall credit risk, tightening originations within our PayPal business loans portfolio and externalizing our European Buy Now, Pay Later portfolio. In the fourth quarter, non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 9% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure.  For the full year, the same expenses declined 11%.  Non-GAAP operating income grew 11% in the quarter to nearly $1.9 billion and for the full year by 14% to $6.7 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.3% in the quarter and increased 110 basis points to 22.4% for the full year due to better operating expense leverage in each period. PayPal generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This includes a $1.7 billion net benefit from the sale of our European Buy Now, Pay Later receivables to KKR, partly offset by the impact of new loans originated as held for sale.  Adjusting for this impact, we generated nearly $800 million in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and $4.6 billion for the full year. Higher-than-expected changes in working capital and cash taxes had a negative impact on fourth quarter free cash flow. In the quarter, we completed more than $600 million in share repurchases, bringing full year share repurchases to approximately $5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.3 billion and debt of $11.3 billion.  Before turning to our first quarter and 2024 guidance, I have 2 updates to our guidance approach to share. First, for the time being, we intend to move away from providing annual revenue guidance and instead provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. Given the considerable changes underway at the company, we believe it is prudent to guide revenue 1 quarter ahead and provide updates as the year progresses. Second, the first quarter and 2024 guidance that we're providing today excludes the impact of stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP results. This is consistent with our historical approach.  Beginning in the first quarter, we will include stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. We will update our reporting and guidance accordingly at that time. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of our cost structure and one that we believe we need to manage more directly and transparently. Including stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP earnings, we'll introduce more accountability and discipline and will align our own performance measures to the way that many investors already evaluate our business. In terms of our outlook for the first quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 6.5% at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage. With respect to our full year financial plan, as we have said previously, with all of the changes we are making, 2024 will be an execution year and one we're positioning the business for long-term success will be critical. For the full year, we are planning for a relatively consistent macroeconomic environment with some level of interest rate declines as we move through the year.  We also assume that overall consumer spending and activity levels will remain relatively consistent. We expect full year 2024 non-GAAP EPS to be roughly in line with prior year EPS of $5.10. Underpinning our outlook, we expect roughly flat transaction margin dollars. Alex discussed our innovation and product enhancements earlier. Many of these are already in pilot or launch, but will require execution throughout the year before we begin to see impact. Our guidance includes minimal impact from these initiatives. We expect a low single-digit increase in non-transaction operating expense. As Alex mentioned, we announced actions last week to reduce cost to drive continued efficiencies while at the same time, investing more in our product engineering and platform teams to drive growth.  There are 2 factors to be mindful of that will impact our other value-added services revenue. First, while we are still seeing benefit from the higher interest rate environment, we expect that this tailwind will be much less significant in 2024. Second, we continue to take an active and prudent approach to managing our credit exposure. We are carrying lower credit receivables after tightening originations last year. And for our off-balance sheet originations, we are planning for ongoing normalization and loss rates, which will impact the revenue share that we earn.  We expect free cash flow for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion. From a financial policy perspective, we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Absent inorganic growth opportunities, we expect to continue allocating approximately 70% to 80% of our free cash flow to share buybacks. However, given our strong cash position as we enter the year, we are currently planning for at least $5 billion in share buybacks in 2024. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now hand it back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Appreciate all the details here. I wanted to dig in on the outlook for transaction margin dollars to be flat. Can you just give us a little bit more, maybe high-level thoughts on the key drivers there, and maybe some of the levers that are available to you to get the transaction margin dollar growth to accelerate beyond that in 2024. I get a lot of questions about it, obviously. So I'd love to hear the puts and takes that you would underline for us. James Chriss : First, let me start just with recognizing how much change there is that we've gone through. You heard it in my prepared remarks, but we essentially have a brand-new executive leadership team. We've accelerated the pace of innovation. The first-look experience you saw a couple of weeks ago, really was innovation that could have taken months or years that I'm very proud of the team, accelerating and getting done in 60 days. And we are at a point now where even our mindset shift, this focus on profitable growth is something that's new for the organization, and we are grinding away every day. And so with that said, let me unpack the components of transaction margin growth.  The way I think about it is there's 3 levers there. The first is really around the branded experience. This is a proven experience for us. It's one that we -- in some of the innovations that we put out, both for merchants that improve their experience as well as consumers with a new app that allows them to get through the experience better. That is a significant lever for us. And one that, to be honest, we've under-invested in. And if I take just specifically the mobile experience for our consumers, has been underwhelming. And it's something that with the new innovations we just rolled out, I expect for us to be able to continue to see improvement there.  The second is around the unbranded processing. This is an area that we have invested significantly in. With Fastlane now, we have really, I believe, one of the best products in the market for our merchants. We're seeing the highest conversion rates out there, and it's something that our merchants are looking for and looking to adopt. We also are looking to move into new areas for growth that have higher margin opportunities such as international and small business. And it allows us to actually have different conversations with our customers and really price to value the product. And the third is really what I'd consider a bucket of value-added services.  This is a combination of improving our flows with our consumers to ensure that we're attaching the products that we need to whether it's Buy Now, Pay Later or our Cashback Mastercard, these are flows that we've not optimized and were underperforming when it comes to really attach.  And then some of the new offerings that we rolled out, you saw our advanced offerings platform as well as smart receipts. These are all ways that we can monetize and improve the connection between our merchants and consumers. So that's different ways that I think about the components. Jamie Miller : Yes. And Tien-Tsin, I'll jump in on the '24 specific puts and takes on transaction margin dollars. And first, you heard us both say earlier that on the initiatives that Alex has been talking about, we have included limited impact on that in our guidance. But if I pull back, really, we're viewing largely steady trends to what you saw last year, maybe in slightly different proportions. So Branded Checkout being a healthy contributor to growth, improvement in our PSP margin profile. We expect some benefit in our interest income on customer balances, but really, that should be much smaller than what we saw last year. And we do expect some headwinds to our credit revenue, which as I think, as I mentioned in the script on the call, with loss rate normalization happening to pre-pandemic levels and that trend is starting to work.  We'll just see lower rev share from our partnerships in that space. And then offsetting that, we really see also that some of our smaller product lines in the aggregate will be a drag on TM. This will be to a much lower extent than last year. But in areas where we do platform consolidation, there are times we deprecate products to really push customers to new platforms.  Good example of that is PPCP, we do see some drop-off. And we've got a few other products that, as you know, we have not invested as heavily as perhaps we should have in the last couple of years. And as we work our way through that, there'll be some offset there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to hone in on branded TPV growth a bit. I think it slowed by 1 point in the fourth quarter to 5%. Was hoping you could maybe take us through some of the monthly intra-quarter trends there, any market share observations you might have had from holiday season. And then just some general comments on what you're planning for on branded TPV growth in the first quarter and full year '24? James Chriss : Thanks, Jason. Let me set the context and I'll see if Jamie wants to pile on. Our branded checkout performance was 6% for the year. It's been pretty consistent. And for what we're looking going into next year, we're expecting it to be consistent as well. And as we've talked about, that doesn't include or includes minimal aspects of the new innovations that we put out there.  Let me talk about just some of the levers when it comes to the new innovations or ways that I think about accelerating branded checkout because this obviously is going to be a big focus for the organization. The first is we really have to improve the value proposition for our consumers. This is why you see us leaning into rewards, ensuring that we've got an improved experience that reduces latency and really leaning in on mobile as well so that our consumers have a better branded checkout experience.  Second, the acceleration of Fastlane when it comes to our merchants not only improves the unbranded opportunity where we can see 70% of the customers that come through the Fastlane experience, but allows us to have a second engagement with our customers and bring them back into a branded experience at a later date, show them all the different reasons why they should be using PayPal or getting a reward back for a purchase that they made.  So I think these, again, are just a couple of examples of innovations that we're leaning into now that allow us to really focus on that branded experience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : Alex, Jamie, just to follow up a bit on some of this train of thought. I mean I know you're mentioning you're not incorporating these new initiatives in your transaction profit growth thoughts for this year. But when we think about some of these -- I mean most of these to your point, Alex, are going to be beneficial to gross profit growth. And so I guess we'd love to hear a little bit more around what you'd measure us, how you would measure success, whether it's the PPCP initiatives or unbranded as well as the branded checkout experience, what KPI should we look for? And I guess a little bit more on timing. If not this year, when do you want investors to expect some traction in actual gross profit re-acceleration? James Chriss : Yes. Well, thank you, Darrin. And look, let me be clear. We are not putting in the expectations into the guidance until we see execution. We just think it's prudent for us to put points on the board before we put it into the guidance. That said, the teams are grinding on this every single day. We are having conversations with our merchants and introducing them. As I mentioned on the call, the reaction has been quite encouraging from the innovations. There is demand in the market, and we are starting right now. And I will tell you, the conversations that we're having now that we're focused on both innovations that are driving demand as well as improvements for these merchants are different than we've had in the past. So I just want you to know, we are working now on this, and we will update you as we start to see points on the board and adjust our guidance as needed. Secondly, back to your first question around how I think about this. Look, the thing I want you to take away from all of this innovation that we rolled out in first look is this is really changing the way we engage with our customers and our merchants. We are now creating experiences across the entire customer life cycle, not just at checkout. So we are driving not only a checkout improvement, the 50% improvement in latency being able to improve Fastlane, but now we're starting to see a customer value proposition with CashPass, giving rewards back to our customers so that they have a reason to choose PayPal at every purchase. We're improving the onboarding and the reboarding as they come back into the app and start to now attach our Mastercard or debit experiences or Buy Now, Pay Later. We're improving the post-purchase experience where we now have smart receipts or package tracking so that we can improve the engagement between our merchants and our consumers, and we now have an ongoing active use engagement.  And then we're leaning into demand generation and actually solving the biggest challenge that our merchants have, which is finding new customers as we think about our Advanced Offers Platform or creating shopper insights so that our merchants can start to engage and personalize their experience through our data and through the AI that we can lean through. So the way I think about it is we are looking at the entire end-to-end experience, and we'll measure our success through the metrics that you have. It's going to turn into what does transaction margin look like? What are -- what does active use look like from our ongoing users? So that's how we think about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : I wanted to ask a question about PayPal's commitment to durable, high-quality profitable growth. How does that impact the pricing strategy in Braintree? What unprofitable is the system products will PayPal deemphasize? And how does that tie into your 2024 non-transaction OpEx outlook of flat? James Chriss : Great. Thanks, Mike. Let me talk about Braintree and then I'll have Jamie talk about potentially some of the other products and businesses. So let me take you back. Braintree, if you go back a few years ago, was really trying to establish itself in the market. It hasn't delivered at scale, and there were gaps in the product. We've invested heavily in the product and have really focused on some of the largest U.S. enterprise customers, which now have proven the scale while we've gotten the product to parity. Then you look at what we just rolled out with innovations like Fastlane, I think we've now leapfrogged the competition. So what does that allow us to do? It allows us to be the one-stop shop for merchants, it allows us to provide a best-in-class experience on auth rates and give them the ability to have not only the best processing and unbranded, but also package that with PayPal and with all the other ways that customers want to pay, including Buy Now, Pay Later.  We now are shifting towards being able to have a price-to-value conversation with our merchants and being able to really start to think about how will we ramp up go to market for not only Braintree, but also PPCP.  We also are now moving into markets that have higher margins. So international and small business with both Braintree and PPCP allow us to now, again, price to value and have different conversations. So that is how we think about it. We're not focused on unprofitable growth when it comes to Braintree. We think we now have the product in market to be able to compete effectively and win. Jamie Miller : Yes. And Mike, on the other part of your question, I guess what I'd say is we are just doing too many things. And our biggest opportunity is that we have to make decisions to stop things and to really focus and that gets into market competitiveness. It gets into pricing, it gets into really leaning into market opportunity and really stopping doing things that prevent us from doing the right thing in those spaces. So we are knee deep in that right now. And so when we talk about a year of transformation and execution, that's exactly what we're talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about how much leeway or opportunity you have to continue kind of taking out expenses while simultaneously executing on the growth strategy? How are you thinking about striking that balance sort of cost control versus growth? And I guess, how confident are you that you have room to do both? Jamie Miller : Yes, I would say that is definitely an and, not an or. And that's exactly what we're doing with the workforce announcements we made a week ago and really taking that and putting that back into product into engineering and into marketing, we have got to invest deeply to grow this place. And it's really important for us to just set the company up for the future. And to do that, the innovation muscle, the commercial muscle means that rightsizing our expense levels isn't going to be something that we -- that is a won and done.  We know we have significant opportunity to continue to be more efficient, be that through automation, be that through driving deeper productivity. And as we harvest that, that just gives us more levers to invest that are -- the right things for our profile as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : James, a quick clarification and I have a question for Alex. But you said that starting from the first quarter, you'll be including stock-based compensation in your non-GAAP rather than excluding it. So does that mean that if we just imagine that we fast forward a few months, that the non-GAAP earnings would be reduced by roughly that $1.8 billion. Just looking for a little bit of clarification there. And then, Alex, you made an interesting comment in terms of like feeling things are too big organizationally. But I'm wondering how you're feeling about the tech stack right now and the level of integration and where we're at from that perspective in terms of your ability to drive the kinds of improvements and perhaps add functionality to improve the customer experience. Jamie Miller : Yes, James, on your first question, you have it exactly right. So beginning in the first quarter, we'll start including stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP and closer to that time, we'll do the look back where we'll provide the retrospective data so that we've got everything on a comparable basis. But yes, you're thinking about that right. James Chriss : And then, James, on your question around the tech stack. Look, I'll be transparent. The company has gone through significant growth over the last few years and a lot of acquisitions. We have not invested enough in creating a single platform. That again slows us down when it comes to innovation, and it slows us down when it comes to being able to leverage the data across the ecosystem. We are investing heavily in that now and starting to see real improvement.  I mentioned a couple of things on the call, but really being able to put out a reporting system that now sees across the entire ecosystem, being able to see a single view of the customer so that now we can provide innovations to customers but also actually be able to cross-sell and be able to say, \"hey, this is a customer that has this risk profile and should be in these 2 or 3 different products\", is a huge win for us as we start to consolidate. It also just accelerates our engineering velocity, being able to have a services-based engineering team that can build once and deploy across the entire ecosystem is the direction that we're heading in. And so you started to see that. We -- even the innovations that we just put out over the last couple of weeks weren't really possible without us being investing heavily in the platform. But I also would say we have a ways to go. And so it's a primary focus for me and the organization and will drive velocity and efficiency. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : A major regulatory change in payments just went through in Europe with Apple opening up its iOS and NFC chip for physical point-of-sale payments. What opportunity does this present to PayPal? James Chriss : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. We are tracking this closely. Apple is a great partner of ours. And our customers that love PayPal on the online e-commerce side are demanding -- being able to have an omnichannel and off-line solution as well. So we'll be working closely on this. And when it is available, we will be ready to be able to deliver for our customers, both online and off-line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Alex, one more on the initiatives. I'm just trying to think through the prioritization of these additional investments you'll be making. Of those 6 initiatives, which do you think will sort of yield the returns quickest? And maybe a little bit more on timing of them, maybe not 2024, but how early?  And then, Jamie, just a quick question on the interest rates. I think you mentioned, you don't expect it to have a big impact or as big an impact in 2024, but is there an explicit rate forecast you have? Like do you have lower rates in 2024? James Chriss : So all of the innovations are incredibly exciting for us, but let me be specific on your question. The two that I am closely watching and our teams are executing on immediately is really a focus on the branded experience. This is both for the combination of merchants and consumers, easing that experience for a customer to choose PayPal, have a reward that comes back to them, ensure that they're able to get through the experience with velocity and check out every time with PayPal, is a huge focus for us, and that's where we are driving a new app experience. And again, all of these innovations will be coming out over the next couple of weeks to months.  Then we have to drive adoption. So that is having conversations with merchants, ensuring that they're upgrading to our latest innovations, that's ensuring that we make it easy for them as well. So that's why you've seen us launch a new developer portal. We're creating no-code, low-code experiences so developers can take the demand that they've shown because they have a best-in-class experience now and get it into market. So step one is I'm very focused on that branded experience.  The second one is on the unbranded side, which is ensuring that Fastlane gets rolled out. That, to me, starts to create an interesting network effect of us being able to have not only a branded experience, but for them, those consumers that pass a branded experience, whether it's ours or anyone else's and want to just go through a guest checkout flow, we're able to identify them, we're able to help them and our merchants complete the transaction. And then we're able to have a follow-up conversation with that customer as well because they've gone through our Fastlane experience. So those 2 to me, we need to get rolled out, we need to get points on the board and show that it's driving, but driving outcomes, but that is where I'm most focused on right now. Jamie Miller : Yes. And Sanjay, on the interest rate question, we do expect that the interest income on customer balances will have a strong growth this year, but really it will be more first half-focused. The second half, we do expect a series of rate cuts that is assumed in our macroeconomic scenario that underpins our guide, and that's why the second half should be much lighter on that front. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn it to Alex Chriss for closing remarks. James Chriss : Fantastic. Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to reemphasize that 2024 is going to be a transition year focused on execution to position our business for long-term success. I'm excited with where we're positioned in the market, and I know that there is a real opportunity to grow our role in commerce.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter 2024. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ryan Wallace, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ryan Wallace : Good morning. Thank you for joining PayPal's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is Alex Chriss, our President and CEO; and Jamie Miller, our CFO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast. Both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our website. All information in this presentation is as of today's date. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. And with that, let me turn the call over to Alex. James Chriss : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. This quarter, we delivered a solid set of results, and the year is off to a good start. Our new leadership team is operating well together, and we are really starting to get our arms around the business. You will see in our numbers and the read-through that our efforts are beginning to make a difference. We also see substantial need for continued retooling of the company, how we work with our customers and how we execute. We are encouraged by the progress to date but remain realistic that we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity to drive profitable growth ahead of us. What we said at the start of the year still holds. This is a transition year where we are focused on execution and making critical choices that will set the business up for long-term success. We have a plan that will return this company to where it needs to be and remain focused on execution to get there. We see clear opportunities for operational improvements across our large enterprise, small business and consumer businesses, including Venmo, and in driving more efficiency across the organization. But it will take time to prudently drive a meaningful and sustainable transformation. In the first quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis on $404 billion in total payment volume. Transaction margin dollar performance grew 4%, which was better than expected, thanks in part to actions we took. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 27% year-over-year. Our results are stronger than we expected earlier in the year, and they require some unpacking to put them in the context of the full year. What I want you to understand is what we are focused on, namely, making surgical changes to the way we are running the company. Some of these will have an immediate impact and others will take longer to bear fruit. As such, we need to maintain flexibility throughout this year to make important decisions to drive the long-term growth of the business. This includes decisions about where we prioritize and reinvest, how we go to market and actions that can be taken to sharpen our value proposition for consumers and merchants. With that in mind, we do now expect full year EPS to grow mid- to high single digits, which is partially driven by our better-than-expected start to the year. Jamie will take you through our Q1 results, contours of the year and updated guidance in just a few moments. Let me first spend some time providing an update on our execution against our customer strategies and investment priorities and detail progress on our efforts to operate more efficiently. Turning to our 3 customer groups. We continue to make steady progress on strengthening our strategic positioning and product portfolio. For large enterprises, we continue to focus on accelerating growth in branded checkout and driving the profitability of our business. We are executing to get upgrades to our core branded checkout experiences to the market. We continue to make good progress in our early testing of Fastlane by PayPal with a focused group of merchants. And data from those alpha merchants show that returning Fastlane users are converting at nearly 80%. We are just getting started and already creating a low double-digit lift in guest checkout conversion for participating merchants. The results so far are encouraging as incremental conversion improves our merchants' growth and profits. Demand for this product is promising, and we expect to make Fastlane generally available in the U.S. in the second half of the year. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on making it even easier to pay with PayPal by removing friction from the checkout process. In the coming months, we will continue to move to more passwordless authentication processes, like biometrics, and launch a redesigned mobile checkout experience, which we believe will result in higher conversion rates. We've begun active discussions with our largest enterprise customers to focus on commercial outcomes that reflect the true value of our payments processing platform and the services we provide. As we speak, many of our top merchants are gathered in California for our annual Commerce 360 Customer Conference, where our teams will go deep on the innovations we plan to bring to market this year and the value they can provide. We are also in the early stages of evaluating the overall dynamics and pipeline of our top 10,000 merchant accounts. As we evaluate our programs, we see clear opportunities to price to value, not only with our PSP processing, but especially with our value-added services that we already provide, services such as payouts, fraud prevention and processing orchestration. This process will take time, but we have a focused game plan, and we are already having fruitful conversations that are helping merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us, including through our value-added services. For example, DraftKings recently went live with our fraud management solution, Fraud Protection Advanced, which combines our intelligence with advanced machine learning and analytics to help businesses protect themselves from ever-evolving fraud threats. This is an example of a best-in-class offering and a key differentiator against our competitors. It also showcases our ability to leverage AI to drive customer benefit and is an area where we can price to the value we provide. For small- and medium-sized businesses, the launch of our PayPal Complete Payments Platform has been gaining momentum over the past couple of quarters. We've made good progress in expanding PPCP's geographic reach to now more than 34 countries. In the first quarter, we expanded the platform to Canada, the U.K. and more than 20 European markets. We also added new features to PPCP in Australia, Germany and the U.S. in recent months. Additionally, we are seeing positive response to our new low- and no-code tools for merchants and developers to integrate PPCP, which we launched in March. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately 7% of our SMB volume is already on PayPal Complete Payments, with our team focused on distribution through partners that can accelerate adoption to the largest number of customers. Our efforts here are important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest branded checkout integration, which will include Fastlane, so that consumers have a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop, and merchants will benefit from higher conversion. On average, merchants who adopt PPCP use approximately 4 PayPal products, which deepens the relationship and reduces churn. This translates to an average revenue per account for our PPCP full-stack merchant that is nearly 2x that of an SMB on a legacy integration. As you all know, I have a deep passion for helping small businesses succeed. Frankly, this is an area where PayPal took its eye off the ball. Over the years, we've deprecated products and made pricing decisions that negatively affected our market positioning. Despite that, we still have the largest population of SMBs anywhere, who are using our products and eager for us to do more for them. This is an area where we are investing to correct our course. We are here to serve and win the small business market. On the consumer front, the PayPal app is at the center of our strategy to leverage the power of our data to create more value for our customers and unlock new sources of revenue and margin expansion opportunities. In the first quarter, we revamped the PayPal app with a new look and feel and introduced enhancements to our rewards program to enable shoppers to get the most out of their money while increasing conversion for merchants. Additionally, we began testing a comprehensive rewards-focused life cycle marketing program. When tested with approximately 20% of our PayPal app users, we saw it drive a nearly 7% increase in weekly app logins and 4% increase in transaction margin per user. Introducing consumers to new products, like our debit card that can help maximize the value they receive from PayPal, is a major focus. The enhancements our team made to our onboarding flow enabled a 38% increase in debit card first-time users during the first quarter. On average, a customer who adopts the PayPal debit card is more engaged, generating a 2x lift to transaction activity and a nearly 20% increase to average revenue per account compared to users who primarily use checkout. Approximately 4% of our active PayPal consumer accounts in the U.S. have a debit card. So while we have a lot more to do, this work is meaningful to the economics of our business. In the quarter, we onboarded BigCommerce and WooCommerce to our package tracking solution. In the 12 months since launch, we've had approximately 7 million active accounts use package tracking. This is a key pillar in our post-purchase strategy. Package tracking not only allows consumers to track their shipments within the PayPal app, but will also enable us to make personalized purchase recommendations and present relevant offers through the app and our AI-powered Smart Receipts. We believe these innovations will drive engagement with the PayPal app and incentivize future branded checkout activity. For Venmo, we are focused on giving our customers more ways to immediately use their Venmo debit card in person with Apple Pay and Google Pay, which you will see in the market in the coming months. In the first quarter, we saw a 21% year-over-year increase in consumers using our Venmo debit card. Remember, Venmo debit cardholders are among the most engaged accounts and on average drives 6x the incremental revenue than that of a P2P-only customer. Simultaneously, we are making it easier for consumers to use their Venmo balance when making payments or sending money to friends. In the first quarter, balance-funded P2P senders grew by 17%, which contributed to our overall transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. Our leadership team is continuing to go through our business from top to bottom, understanding where we can operate more efficiently and invest in the innovation that will offer the greatest impact for our customers and PayPal. This is a mindset shift we are driving throughout the entire organization. Investing for durable growth backed by a clear payback path and time horizon remains a top priority. Investing in branded checkout and better serving our small business customers are 2 focus areas you heard me talk about today. We are also actively evaluating and greenlighting new investments to accelerate future growth that support and strengthen our strategic priorities. A good example of this is our remittance business, Xoom, which has stagnated while similar services have gained share. This business has been on a negative revenue trajectory due to a lack of prioritization and clarity about its value proposition. That is now changing. We are executing the right product refinements bundled with an enhanced and more customizable pricing model intended to promote growth over the long run. We plan to reduce the cost of cross-border transfers and provide consumers the option to eliminate transaction fees altogether when funding with our PYUSD stablecoin. We are activating those plans, and we expect to see tangible progress throughout 2024 and beyond. The key takeaway here is that we are in the process of assessing a handful of areas of investment where we believe there are compelling unit economics and market upside. These may mean that we will make decisions to invest in 2024 where we believe these investments will ultimately contribute to the sustainable and profitable growth of the company. At the same time, we must maintain our focus. We are continuing to evaluate the markets we operate in and the products we offer. Where we see areas to improve focus and prioritization, we will take action and update you accordingly. Finally, a few words on our continued efforts to drive operational efficiency and productivity across PayPal. We are instilling a rigorous cost/benefit discipline throughout the company and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs. We are also investing in automation that will help answer our customers' frequently asked questions, simplify the integration process for our merchants and enable our team to deploy solutions more quickly. As mentioned on the last earnings call, we have started reporting stock-based compensation as part of our non-GAAP metrics beginning this quarter. In addition to our annual incentive plan, shifting to cash payment from stock, we have also better aligned our incentive programs to performance, particularly focusing on transaction margin and non-GAAP operating income growth. We will continue to focus on a pay-for-performance culture that appropriately aligns pay with results. I'll conclude by thanking the PayPal team for continuing to innovate and serve our customers. While we are still in the early innings of driving a meaningful and comprehensive transformation of PayPal to deliver the sustainable and high-quality growth we are aiming for, our first quarter results are an encouraging indication of what our team's renewed strategic focus and persistent execution can achieve. We will continue to update you on our execution throughout the year and be transparent about our progress. I am confident that we are taking the right steps to build long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll hand it over to Jamie to take you through our first quarter results. Jamie Miller : Thanks, Alex. Good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year with first quarter results that were above our expectations. As Alex mentioned, it's still early in the company's transformation. We are getting deeper in understanding both our challenges and our opportunities with much greater clarity. Our goal for 2024 is to foundationally set up the business for the future by making key decisions and aligning our investment path for growth. And to do so, we are laser-focused on strategic analysis and decision-making, driving innovation back into the business and executing with excellence. While it will take time for our efforts to sustainably flow through results, the speed at which the team is moving is encouraging, and we are making steady progress. Let me start with a summary of our financial performance. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results now include the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes. This change is intended to enhance transparency, operating discipline and align our performance measures to how many investors already evaluate our business. Now moving to our results. As Alex mentioned, in the first quarter, revenue increased 9% at spot and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 4% year-over-year, improving in growth by more than 400 basis points from the fourth quarter. I'll walk through the drivers of that growth in a few minutes and provide context on the shape of the year, including tailwinds that we expect to be more pronounced in the first half compared to the second half. Under our updated non-GAAP methodology, earnings per share were $1.08, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Under the company's prior non-GAAP methodology, which excluded the impact of stock-based compensation, earnings per share would have increased approximately 20% to $1.40, above our guidance for mid-single-digit growth on a comparable basis. Relative to our outlook, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including better-than-expected transaction margin dollars, ongoing expense discipline, the timing of certain investment in marketing spend and interest income. Now I'll walk through some key operating metrics that support those results. We ended the first quarter with 427 million total active accounts and 220 million monthly active accounts. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the fourth quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts in addition to other products. We were encouraged to see total active accounts inflect positively in the quarter, and we remain focused on driving deeper relationships and more activity across our customer base. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 220 million with contribution from both PayPal and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number, was 60 in the first quarter, up 13%. Excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, transactions per active account grew 7%. Moving to volume growth. In the first quarter, TPV grew 14% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $403.9 billion. U.S. TPV grew 12%. International TPV grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis primarily driven by strength in Continental Europe and improvement in Asia. Global branded checkout growth accelerated to 7% on a currency-neutral basis from 5% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter included about a 1 point benefit from leap day as well as ongoing benefits from the growth of global marketplaces. Within branded checkout, large enterprise and international markets were the biggest contributors to growth. We remain laser-focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small- and medium-sized businesses and improving mobile experience, which are critical, particularly in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. PSP processing volume grew 26% in the quarter driven by continued momentum from Braintree compared to 29% in the fourth quarter. Conversations with merchants have been encouraging as we shift our focus to a more disciplined go-to-market and renewal process that emphasizes a focus on profitable growth. Merchants recognize the product and performance improvements we have already started to make and are excited about the pipeline of upcoming innovation. As I noted earlier, revenue in the first quarter increased 9% at spot and 10% on a currency-neutral basis to $7.7 billion. Transaction revenue grew 11% on a spot basis to $7 billion driven by Braintree and branded checkout. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter declined 2% on a spot basis to $665 million. Within other value-added services, interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind. Our credit business performed relatively in line with our expectations with revenue lower because of 2 main factors. First, we are carrying lower merchant receivables after tightening originations last year. Second, we have had lower revenue share on our off-balance sheet U.S. consumer revolving credit portfolio due to ongoing normalization of loss rates. Transaction take rate declined 5 basis points to 1.74% driven primarily by lower foreign exchange fees and lower gains from foreign currency hedges. In addition, mix shift to large merchants continued to impact our branded checkout take rate. Transaction margin dollars increased 4% in the first quarter. Higher interest on customer balances, branded checkout, better transaction loss performance and lower credit losses were the largest contributors to growth. While the performance of the core business has been relatively consistent, we expect that a few of these tailwinds are likely to be less meaningful as we move through the year. Specifically, we expect to see lower year-over-year benefit from interest on customer balances and lower year-over-year improvement on transaction and loan loss performance. Non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 2% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting into key strategic initiatives. Part of the decline in operating expenses is a result of certain corporate and marketing investments deferred to the second half as well as lower stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating income grew 15% in the quarter to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded 84 basis points to 18.2%. PayPal generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter or $1.9 billion, excluding the impact of held-for-sale accounting related to our European Buy Now, Pay Later externalization. In the quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5.1 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.7 billion and debt of $11 billion. I'll now move to our second quarter and 2024 guidance. Consistent with the approach we shared in February, we will continue to provide revenue guidance 1 quarter at a time. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 6.5% at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to increase by a low double-digit percentage. For the full year, we continue to plan for a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment. With respect to earnings per share, we now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow by a mid- to high single-digit percentage. As Alex said earlier, we are in a transition year, and we do not expect that our quarterly progression will be linear. To help bridge this outlook compared to our prior guidance for approximately flat non-GAAP EPS, there are 2 main factors I would point you to. First, our inclusion of stock-based compensation expense within non-GAAP results is expected to benefit EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points this year. Second, we saw meaningful outperformance in the first quarter relative to our plans. We intend to reinvest a portion of this performance back into the business. We expect earnings growth to be more muted in the second half of the year due primarily to less benefit from interest income on customer balances, normalization in transaction and loan loss performance as we progress through the year and the expected timing of investment actions. Underpinning our outlook, we now expect transaction margin dollars to be slightly positive for the full year. We expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly. Embedded within this outlook is the flexibility to make key strategic decisions to invest and reinvigorate profitable growth within components of the portfolio and accelerate go-to-market efforts. For the full year, we expect other value-added services revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year. This excludes any potential impact from the CFPB late fee regulation, given pending litigation across the banking industry and uncertainty on both timing and implementation. As a company, we have already taken steps to mitigate the future impact, though these take time to fully take hold. Consistent with the approach we shared last quarter, our guidance includes minimal impact from the new innovations rolling out this year. Our focus is on execution as we begin moving from test and pilot phases into launch. We continue to expect free cash flow for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion and for at least $5 billion in share buybacks. In closing, 2024 is off to a solid start as we drive significant change across the company. We have clear opportunities to lean in further. We are doing the hard work now to position PayPal for profitable growth in the years ahead, and it has been incredibly energizing to see the team's commitment to this goal. With that, I'll now hand it back to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just I wanted to ask on transaction margin dollars, if you don't mind, the acceleration there. Maybe can you give us a little bit more detail on the growth across the main businesses, branded checkout, unbranded and what we've been calling other? And of course, on the other side, love to hear if there's any change in thinking there on the strategy to reclaim growth or even divest some of those assets. James Chriss : Yes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. Let me hand it over to Jamie to walk you through transaction margin, and then I'll take the more strategic piece on other and how we think about the year. Jamie Miller : I'll just walk you through the drivers for transaction margin growth during the quarter. We were happy with the positive growth progression. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a lot underway to really position the company for positive TM growth over time. In the quarter, just to walk it a little bit, interest income on customer balances was the highest contributor. Branded checkout continued to grow profitably and was a nice contributor to our growth this quarter. We did benefit from leap day, but we also benefited from strength in large enterprise and international. We've been very focused this year on PSP profitability, and that will ramp over time, but it wasn't a meaningful contributor this quarter. And we just had small but I'd say steady ongoing product improvements in Venmo and P2P. So we saw some shifting there and better transaction and credit loss performance. And then lastly, to the last point of your question, we did see a smaller drag from the other smaller parts of the portfolio. I don't know, Alex, do you want to talk through that a little bit. James Chriss : Yes. Let me just sort of take a step back, Tien-Tsin, and talk about how we've been thinking about the year. You've heard us talk about this as a transition year. The way we've really been focusing the team is on sort of 3 different components to make sure that we're set up well for profitable growth into the future. The first is accelerating innovation and ensuring that we've got best-in-class innovation, whether that's on the consumer side and ensuring that our customers have a frictionless, incredible experience in checkout; to an unbranded side where we allow our merchants to have, again, best processing available. So really accelerating the velocity of our innovation. The second is adoption and ensuring that once that innovation is actually in the market, that our consumers are using it, that our merchants are onboarding to our latest and greatest integrations. I'll give you an example. We talked about in the last call the opportunity for debit card engagement. We changed the onboarding flow inside of the PayPal app this past quarter and saw a 69% higher debit card engagement just by changing that flow. So a big focus on the team on not just delivering our innovation but actually delivering the adoption. And then lastly, as you mentioned, cleaning up some of our underperforming services. I mentioned Xoom on the call. That is a business that we looked at very hard. It's been underperforming for a couple of years now. And we wanted to make a decision on, is this an asset that's strategic to the business that should be a profitable grower for us, or not? And when we looked at it, we realized that there were just opportunities where we had priced ourselves out of the market in a number of different corridors that we could make strategic decisions on and actually make this a profitable, growing business. And so that's just an example. We're going top to bottom throughout the organization. And there will be some businesses or markets that don't meet that cut, and we'll let you know when we make those decisions. And there will be other ones that, with focus and execution, we'll turn around. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Darrin Peller : I think it would be helpful, if you don't mind, just first revisiting some of the initiatives around unbranded and your conviction and the timing around the impact from them on -- perhaps on transaction margin. But maybe even more specifically, if you've had discussions with Braintree merchants around pricing, and I think you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but more pricing to value than pricing to win, how are those conversations going? And I guess, Alex, market-wide, when we think about the appreciation of the value-added services and differentiator for PayPal's 2-sided network, how has that been resonating in the market lately? James Chriss : Yes. Thank you, Darrin. So again, just to sort of paint the high picture on unbranded, this is an important segment for us, both on -- for enterprise and for small business. We have to nail the basics, right? So our customers are looking for the best auth rates, the best uptime, the best availability, the best reliability. And those are things that we are now providing. And I think over the last few years, as we've been building the service, whether it's Braintree or now with PPCP, we've been investing in that and establishing a beachhead for our product across the market. In doing so, though, we also have been building value-added services that, to be totally transparent, we haven't been able to price to value or we haven't been able to ensure that we're engaged with our customers in a real end-to-end strategic conversation. That's changing now. And so to your question, we're having great conversations with both enterprise and small business merchants around our end-to-end solutions, the value-added services that we can now bring to bear, really more strategic conversations, as you mentioned, around the 2-sided network, both on unbranded, on branded, and then even things like our new marketing and ad platform in the mix. We're now having really deep conversations with our merchants that, again, are strategic for them and extract the value that -- of the services that we're providing. So very encouraged with these conversations. Obviously, it's going to take time. Especially for some of the largest merchants, it just takes time for them to roll out and adopt. But our teams right now are, as I mentioned on the call, in L.A. with our Customer 360 conference and showing them all the innovations and having really, really good conversations. So encouraged with the start. It's just going to take time throughout the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Timothy Chiodo : I wanted to [indiscernible], 2 parts really, one around mechanics, one around the uplift. On the mechanics, there might be 2 ways to go about this. One is to make it a part of your unbranded offering, and it could be either part of your negotiations on pricing, it could be a separate fee. But any way you look at it in that scenario, would be more of an, if Fastlane, then Braintree does the processing. But the alternative way would for it to be more of an as-a-service and available on a processor-agnostic basis. Wanted to see, first, if you can give us color on which routes you might be able to take, or maybe both.  And then lastly, on the uplift, which is if we think about the range of net take rates with unbranded at the low end and branded at the high end, where do you think Fastlane could eventually reside on that spectrum? James Chriss : Yes. Thanks, Tim. Let me take the first part and see if Jamie wants to add anything in. We are really excited about Fastlane as it now gets to market. We are live with a handful of early partners, and the results just continue to impress. And just as a reminder, we're now enabling 80% conversion rate for returning users through our guest checkout flow. What's even more exciting, that we've now been able to start to see with these early merchants, is that we're actually seeing unrecognized users, so these are non-PayPal users, opting in to Fastlane at a 40% rate. That just shows the power of our brand, and it shows the power of what PayPal can be. And it goes a little bit to your question around how we think about pricing it and how we think about go-to-market because it's even beyond just an unbranded processing element. I don't want to unveil exactly how our go-to-market will work. But that data point shows that this is not just within a PayPal ecosystem. This is allowing us to actually take the brand that we've established over 25 years and leverage that for our merchants to deliver incredible checkout conversion rate for the 60% of the market that continues to go through a guest checkout experience. So we're really encouraged by the early signs there. In terms of rollout and how we think about it, obviously, on the PPCP side, as we continue to deliver Fastlane to that platform through many of our platform partners, it becomes easy for our small businesses to, one click, turn that on. So that will be a big part of our rollout. And then having good merchant conversations as well on the large enterprise side. And again, those are kicking off really in earnest this week at our C360 conference. So again, the last thing I'd say just on pricing, and then, Jamie, see if you want to add anything, is because we've focused this year on a transition year, we may get very aggressive on the pricing side when it comes to Fastlane for 2024 because we want to drive adoption. We think this is the best in the market innovation that all merchants should have access to. And as they think about winning this shopping season, our encouragement is improve the onboarding for them, create low-code, no-code opportunities for them to get up and running as fast as possible so that they can win this season and really prove to themselves that conversion improvement. And rest assured, we'll be pricing to value over time to ensure that we get the right value from that. Jamie, anything you'd add? Jamie Miller : No, I think you've said it all. I really think Fastlane reinforces our holistic value prop, both for branded and for unbranded. And the focus on merchant checkout conversion, and that being at our core, I think, drives a strong value prop, and it will support strong pricing over time. James Chriss : The only thing that I would -- just last point is this conversion rate with Fastlane, what's so exciting to me is not just the 40% that's coming in, it's unrecognized users leveraging our brand and the 80% conversion rate of guest checkout for returning users. But this is just early days. This is with a handful of merchants. This is a network effect. As we gain more and more users coming through, as these users now become returning users over and over again, those rates should continue to improve. And so this is already an order of magnitude better than anything else in the market. And with the network effect and scale that we have, we just expect it to continue to get better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Alex, could you comment on the European Commission ruling to open up the iPhone NFC hardware on the handset, and whether you see that as a competitive opening for PayPal in Europe? I know there's some rumblings in the U.S. as well about that type of a move. I mean, how ready from a product perspective are you to take advantage of a more open NFC environment? James Chriss : Yes. Thank you for the question, Ramsey. So let me set the context so that it's clear how we think about it. First, we must play in an omnichannel world. We have established ourselves as the leader in the market in online. And our customers love us and use us globally for online checkout. But they are demanding an off-line opportunity, an omnichannel opportunity, and to get the value that we're able to provide as we start to deliver not only the basics of our security and flexibility, but also as our rewards platform continues to improve, we want to be able to deliver a PayPal service for customers everywhere, anytime, every purchase. So we will be playing in an omnichannel environment. That -- where there are locations where NFC opens up, that obviously becomes a very easy opportunity for us to provide a wallet in an Android or iPhone operating system, and we will be ready. If there are environments where it's not available, we will still operate in an omnichannel. So omnichannel is a strategic initiative for us, it's something that is customer-backed and delivers an incredible PayPal experience, again, for every purchase and every checkout. And we'll take advantage of whatever market, whatever features and functionality we have in whatever market we play in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I just had a 2-part question. The first, just following up on the transaction profit dollar growth. I know you're now expecting slightly positive for the year. I guess that would seem to imply maybe a little bit of deceleration from the Q1 levels, even though the second half comps are a little easier. So just wanted to get a sense of whether that's conservatism or just some normalization of things like transaction and loan loss that helped you in Q1.  And then the second part is just is there any change in your full year expectations for branded payment volume growth? Jamie Miller : So just to walk through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamics on transaction margin dollars. As I talked about before and you noted, I mean, Q1 in particular benefited from a few tailwinds. And we do expect those will be less meaningful as we move throughout the year. First of all, the growth in our interest income on customer balances, it was the largest contributor. But when you start to look at later in the year, the comps just get more challenging. Rates are rising in the latter half of last year. We also saw improvement in transaction loss and credit loss in the first quarter. Transaction loss in particular may not sustain -- or may not be as material as we move throughout the year. And we saw, as you pointed out, a meaningful benefit in loan losses in the first quarter, and we don't expect that to continue either. So I'd say those few things are some of the dynamics. And then our initiatives and some of the new innovation that Alex talked about, it will take time to ramp. So right now, we're focused on execution. We want to keep expectations measured until we see really steady execution results. James Chriss : And just to underline Jamie's point, we have not put -- or we have put limited upside to this innovation that we've talked about in these expectations. And so again, this is about us having the flexibility, us ensuring that we take the right time and do the right thing by the customers as well as building the long term. But those are not built in to the rest of the year. Jamie Miller : Yes. And you asked about branded as well. And when we look at that, we had a nice quarter in terms of TPV and revenue. It was a healthy contributor to our transaction margin dollars. We did have some benefit this quarter from leap day. But by and large, we expect branded revenue trends to be pretty consistent with last year as we look at that. And I guess the other comment I might make is that, when you think about take rate for us, we saw a decent drop last year. We do expect take rate will come down again this year, but not nearly to the same extent. And a little bit of that as it comes through on the branded trend line is just that we're seeing a little bit of mixing towards large enterprise from SMB. And that's impacting the take rate side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Just 2 for me. First, I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the drags on the smaller part of -- from the smaller part of the portfolio and transaction margin dollars. When does that kind of work itself out of the system? And then related to transaction margin dollar growth, you talked about balance-funded Venmo transactions contributing to growth in the quarter. Could you expand a little bit on that? Do you see that scaling over the next couple of years? And what are the opportunities to improve card attach for Venmo users? Jamie Miller : Great. On the smaller parts of the portfolio, I guess what I'd say at a macro level, we had seen a pretty significant drag on that last year. It is coming through this year at a smaller rate. I mean, part of these are products we've deprecated. Some of these are, frankly, acquisitions that we just haven't invested in. And as Alex mentioned, we're going through a process of really looking hard at these. Candidly, some are just in decline, but the declines are smaller. And some, we're investing in or making decisions to really put in more in maintenance mode, which is really shifting the profile going forward. But it will be smaller this year, and it will take a few years for that to burn off. James Chriss : Yes. Let me talk about -- up-level and talk about Venmo for a minute and the opportunity there. So again, on the positive side, we have the leading P2P platform with incredible customer base with disposable income 22% higher than the U.S. average, 60 million monthly active users and 90 million 12-month actives. So this is an incredible platform for us to work at. As we talked about in previous calls, and I'll reiterate here, I'm dissatisfied in how we've really thought about monetizing the platform and really thought about delivering, in many ways, just customer experiences that they're looking for, right? Customers of Venmo are looking for dollars and looking for an alternative to traditional mechanisms when dollars are flowing in. And they want to be able to use Venmo for all of their expenses. Just to give you -- put some numbers behind it. There's $18 billion of net new funds that flow into the platform of Venmo every single month. 80% of those dollars leave within 10 days. That is just unacceptable. And so our ability to provide the products and services that our customers need when those dollars come in, whether that's improving debit card penetration, which you've heard as a focus, and you've heard we already, in some of our onboarding flows, are starting to make significant improvements on; or providing other opportunities for money in or money out opportunities and access to capital for our Venmo users. This is just a clear opportunity and a clear focus area for us. So again, early days. The team is focused on it. Hopefully, you hear sort of a reinvigoration in my voice of what Venmo can be and the opportunity ahead of us. But very, very excited about where we're taking it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Solid first quarter results here. My question is just still more on the big picture. The naysayers on PayPal would say the company is structurally challenged with the rise of payment methods like Apple Pay. Alex, I know you've been at PayPal now for a little over 6 months. What do you think the naysayers are missing on the competitive advantages PayPal still has in the market? In particular to grow branded? James Chriss : Thank you, Bryan. Thanks for the question. So a couple of thoughts here that I think people are maybe not appreciating enough. The first is 60% of the market is still what I would consider to be nonconsumption. 60% of the market still does not use any mark. So that's what we're playing for. We have the best brand. We have the best products and services and the best ability to be able to deliver. And with products like Fastlane not only delivering a reboarding opportunity for our customers, but that stat that I put in earlier, around 40% of unrecognized customers coming through and taking a Fastlane experience, now gives us an opportunity to be able to remarket to them and turn them into PayPal customers. So step one, 60% of the market is nonconsumption, and I think we've got a leading opportunity there. On the other 40%, we're still the leading player. And to be, again, transparent and I've said this before, we have not delivered the innovation and the experience that I would expect and that our customers expect. We are doing that now. Improvement in the app, an improvement in the branded experience, reducing latency by 50%. Investing in passwordless opportunities and passkeys will improve the conversion rate and improve the experience. And then creating value-added opportunities and an increased value proposition for our consumers with rewards. I think we're the only player out there at the scale that we have to provide that end-to-end experience. And again, we provide everything for our customers. It's rewards. It's Buy Now, Pay Later. It's the debit experience. And back to what I mentioned earlier on the call, with an omnichannel play now, PayPal can be the solution that you can use anytime, anywhere. So our ability to now start to play in an offline world and take the same brand and the same experience to every purchase, I think, is something that, again, gets me excited. But we've got to prove it, and we've got to continue to execute and create great experiences in the market for our customers. Bryan Keane : That's great. And just had one follow-up. We are getting a few questions on the pending CFPB regulation on late fees. Any impact on PayPal from CFPB caps on late fees? Jamie Miller : So first, while PayPal is not directly impacted by that regulation, we are indirectly impacted through our revenue share with our consumer credit partner. There's a lot of uncertainty right now around both timing and implementation of that. And as I mentioned before, our guide excludes the impact of that, just given the uncertainty. The industry expects that, if implemented, the impact would be largely offset over time. And we have been very focused on mitigation. We have actions underway. In -- but really, in any scenario, it takes time for those offsets to fully set in. But I guess what I'd say in terms of impact is the date that's being debated right now is the May 14 implementation date. And if that were to be implemented, it would be approximately a 3 percentage point impact to EPS growth for the year, but that is before mitigation. So by 2025, we would expect roughly half of that impact to be offset, and then more over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Wanted to go back to Fastlane. And Alex, you made the comments around making Fastlane available to all merchants and deriving -- so that they can derive the benefits of it. How should we think about that in terms of what needs to be done, timeline for progression, et cetera? It sounds like you're going to start moving beyond at least those initial merchants that are using it now. But just trying to think about like how that ultimately could end up with most of the first -- the merchants served by Braintree, and then ultimately, the merchants served by PayPal more broadly. James Chriss : Yes. Thanks, James. Here's the best way to think about it. First and foremost, we have to have the best innovation in the market. We -- it was important for us to get some early customers up and running and using it. And the data continues to hold and certainly delight these merchants. And look, in this world, they all talk to each other. And so the ability for our merchants to now be rabid fans of the checkout conversion improvement that they're seeing through Fastlane is great proof points for us as we now start to scale it, and again, think about price to value. The second leg will be, okay, now that we've proven this out and we've started to really -- I mean, just to be clear, we're talking about driving conversion rate for some of the largest merchants in the world. We need to make sure that this was proven and that it works before we roll this out at scale. There's a lot on the line to be able to nail this, which is why we're moving at a measured pace and ensuring that, in Q1 and Q2, we've really proven it out. The conversations we're having at our C360 conference right now, the conversations we're having with some of our PPCP platforms that are now rolling it out to small businesses, is okay, what is the way that, as we get to the second half of the year, we can really enable the merchants to have this up and running so that they can win the shopping season, holiday season in the back half of the year? So that's how we're thinking about it. Merchant demand is very encouraging. As you would imagine, when you have a product that improves conversion rate and provides a double-digit lift in guest checkout conversion, that's a game-changer. And so demand is high. We want to make sure that we have as low friction and onboarding experience as possible, which is why we wanted to make sure that the ability for folks to upgrade to new integrations would make sense and be easy for them. And we wanted to make sure that customers could onboard. So the plan is, back half of the year, get as many merchants on so that they can win the holiday season. This will still take time. Not everyone will get on for this holiday season, and we expect that will continue into 2025. But at some point, there will be a tipping point. If I think about over the next year or 2 years, where we are going to expect all of our merchants to be on the latest and greatest integration, which includes Fastlane. And we will then move to deprecate our old integrations. And that's going to be an important milestone for us as we take what is really 15 years of legacy integrations and consolidate them on a more modern stack and a more modern integration for our customers. That allows us to continue to build innovation, continue to drive the best experiences for merchants, for customers, and obviously the best transaction margin results for the company as well. James Faucette : That's great. Appreciate the color there, Alex. And then you mentioned you're getting a little bit of improvement in Venmo transaction margin. How much of that is coming from increased acceptance of Venmo as a payment option versus finding ways to reduce costs in transacting Venmo and P2P transactions, et cetera? Just trying to understand kind of what the drivers there are and what the potential could be. James Chriss : Yes. It is a combination. What I'd say is we're seeing Pay with Venmo really starting to take off. Obviously, it's -- in the U.S., it's an incredibly well-loved brand. And when people see that button, it's an opportunity for them to use those dollars that I mentioned earlier that are in their account. So that's an exciting piece online. The piece that, again, I'm sort of dissatisfied with but excited about the future is the offline piece, right? When I talk about omnichannel, it's for PayPal and for Venmo. And so those billions of dollars that are coming in every month into the Venmo ecosystem, we have to continue to give our customers opportunities, whether it's debit card penetration or other innovation that we come up, with for them to be able to tap and pay and check out. And so all of that will move towards improving transaction margin. That said, we're also getting better with our risk models and leveraging AI. We are -- there's a lot of AI conversations in the market. I would say we are one of the leaders when it comes to leveraging the data that we have at scale to improve our transaction losses, improve the customer service ability for our customers and improve our transaction margin over time. So still, again, early days. There's a lot of work to continue there. But again, my excitement for the path and the direction for Venmo is pretty high. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call back to Alex Chriss for closing remarks. James Chriss : Fantastic. Thank you, Sarah. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you can tell from our results and the comments today, we're making steady progress on our transformation efforts. We had a good first quarter, and we are deep in execution mode. And with time, we will return this company to profitable growth that I know we can deliver. So thank you all.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead. Steve Winoker : Thanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm joined by President and CEO, Alex Chriss and CFO, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses, as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to you, Alex. Alex Chriss : Thank you, Steve. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal delivered a strong second quarter and first half with encouraging operating and financial results. While change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well positioned today, have the right leadership in place, and are moving full steam ahead. I'm confident we are on the right track in making meaningful progress on our transformation to position PayPal for long-term, durable and profitable growth. Looking at our results in the second quarter, total payment volume rose 11% to $417 billion, and we delivered 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8%, representing our best performance on that metric since 2021. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 36% year-over-year. We're encouraged to see not only the strength and stability in PayPal's platform, but also early contributions from some of the initiatives we have underway. Branded checkout continues to grow profitably. Braintree is now meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth for the first time in over two years. Venmo momentum continues to build and monthly active accounts increased across both PayPal and Venmo. Given the strength across PayPal, we are raising our full year guidance for growth in transaction margin dollars and earnings per share, and increasing our investment in strategic growth initiatives that we are driving. Overall, we remain on course with the strategy we set at the beginning of the year. Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation, and focused on execution. We are still early in our transformation, and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do and with greater speed. For example, mobile experiences, SMB, and Venmo are places we are working hard to improve, and we are continuing to identify ways to operate more effectively and efficiently. I want to spend a moment discussing how PayPal stands apart, as a strategic commerce partner. In the past two quarters, we have talked at length about the experience upgrades we are bringing to branded checkout. However, I do not want to lose sight of what makes PayPal truly differentiated, our two-sided network of hundreds of millions of consumers and merchants worldwide. We are building an end-to-end platform, spanning the full commerce journey with superior customer experiences and sales conversion from start to finish. PayPal is one of the only players with both sides of the network, consumer and merchant at scale globally and with the infrastructure to support it. That is incredibly hard to replicate and a powerful foundation on which to launch new innovations including Fastlane and the Ads platform that we are in the early stages of building. The data insights and compounding network effects, give us an incredible advantage that we are now just beginning to harness fully. Today, we operate in a massive $6 trillion plus global e-commerce market that benefits from the ongoing digitization of payments and commerce in new contexts. These tailwinds, combined with the initiatives we are now executing, such as building more omnichannel capabilities and offering more value-added services for consumers and merchants, will expand our addressable market and provide PayPal with significant opportunity for long-term growth. Over the last year, we've been working to transform our global business from a series of products and services into a multi-faceted, omni-channel, and open platform capable of generating value in multiple ways throughout the commerce ecosystem. We are building a platform that delivers far more value to our customers and partners than the individual products we offer. This is a key differentiator for PayPal and will expand our market opportunity over time. The initial response to the innovations we are introducing gives us confidence that we will see more consumers and more engagement in more places across our growing network. That in turn will drive more merchants and higher levels of commitment into our ecosystem. These network effects will be mutually reinforcing, compounding, and add value to the company. Our peers are taking note, and the value of our platform is being recognized by large tech companies that are seeking to partner with us in a variety of new ways. One great example of this is Meta, which we already partner with on multiple fronts. PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across Meta's family of apps. Meta's donations and charitable giving campaigns now run on the PayPal Giving Fund platform. Meta pays out creators and developers using Hyperwallet, and Meta uses Braintree for credit card processing. We are working closely with Meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with Meta in mutually beneficial ways in the months and years ahead. You will continue to hear about more partnerships with deepening commitments over the coming quarters. Let me update you on our customer-backed business strategies. We continue to execute with high velocity to enhance customer experiences and value for our large enterprises, SMBs, and consumers. We are building the foundation for our next phase of growth. For large enterprises, we continue to have a productive conversation to help merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us to take advantage of our full platform capabilities. For example, we recently renewed our contract with DoorDash to expand how we work together. Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks, DoorDash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses. As part of our new agreement, DoorDash has committed as an initial launch partner for our latest branded checkout enhancements that we announced in January. And they will be participating in our new ads platform. Combining our best-in-class payments platform with value-added services that are margin accretive is helping us create a more profitable dynamic. Last quarter, I told you we expected to make Fastlane generally available in the US, in the second half of the year. I'm pleased to announce that in August, we are delivering on that commitment and making Fastlane generally available to merchants in the US. This includes merchants on Braintree and PPCP, as well as through partners, including Salesforce, Adobe, and BigCommerce. While broad adoption will take time, we have heard from many merchants who are excited to add Fastlane and have a robust go-to-market strategy. As I've shared before, data from our early adopters shows that returning Fastlane users, convert at nearly 80% versus the industry average guest checkout conversion closer to 50%. As our network builds with more merchants and consumers, we expect benefits to scale over time because we will be able to recognize even more shoppers. The early feedback we've heard from our merchants and sales team gives us increasing confidence that Fastlane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture the roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded mark. As a reminder, A large part of that 60% is still manual card entry, has low conversion today, and is generally a poor experience for consumers and merchants. Much of that is now changing with Fastlane. For small and medium-sized businesses, we are continuing to improve our value proposition through the rollout of PPCP. We continue to make progress migrating volume from legacy platforms onto this new solution, as well as integrating with new partners and merchants. SMB volume on PPCP continues to trend positively, up more than 40% through the first half of the year. A large portion of that volume is coming from merchants using PayPal as their full stack processor across both branded and unbranded payments. Our efforts here are also important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest branded checkout integration, which will include Fastlane. That will give consumers a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop and help merchants benefit from higher conversion. On average, merchants who adopt PPCP use more products, which deepens our relationship, reduces churn, and drives higher average revenue per account. As I said before, this is an area where we are focused, and we have tremendous opportunity to better serve small businesses' end-to-end needs. For consumers, we are focused on extending our leadership in consumer preference, increasing the share of checkout, and driving more frequent engagement from our consumers. In the second quarter, we launched in-app offers with major brands including Best Buy, Priceline, Lyft, Instacart, Ticketmaster, Walmart, and Nordstrom. We are seeing positive trends in consumer engagement with gross merchandise volume driven by one of our offers nearly tripling in June compared to March. And while still early days, the initial interest from advertisers is encouraging. As we shared before, you will see us invest in marketing in the back half of the year and beyond to further position PayPal and Venmo as rewarding ways to pay. I talked previously about our need to improve our branded checkout experiences on mobile devices. That improvement is now happening. In the first half, we started ramping several designs and technology innovations to our branded checkout flows to improve the experience for our customers. For example, we are launching a new super simple vaulted experience for high repeat use merchants. In initial tests, the redesigned vaulting payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 110 basis points. Experiences like this one are clearly resonating with consumers. And remember that every point of conversion lift, drives significant value for our merchants who are fighting to win every sale. We will be ramping our redesigned branded checkout experiences to all eligible consumers in the US in the coming weeks and months. As the number one branded mark with the largest network of merchant acceptance, we are a ubiquitous checkout solution. We are continuing to innovate and create high converting experiences on both desktop and mobile and across platforms and devices. We also continue engaging consumers post purchase with smart receipts, package tracking, push notifications, and more, adding increased value and driving the PayPal engagement flywheel. In fact, we drove almost 20 million app logins from our post-purchase experiences in June alone, growing more than 70% from a year ago. P2P is an essential acquisition and engagement tool for us, and we are returning it to growth. We suffered declines through 2023, but over the past few quarters we have seen an improvement driven by product enhancements such as new global withdrawal capabilities, better risk decisioning, and more cross-border activity. We will continue to invest in our experiences, pricing, and marketing to drive enhanced awareness and engagement. Turning to Venmo, we are building on the business\u2019s strong market position. In the second quarter, Venmo processed more than $73 billion in total payment volume, growing 8% year-over-year. With monthly active, increasing 5% year-over-year, to nearly 62 million. Both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth. For example, both Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew approximately 30%. In the second quarter, we launched push provisioning of the Venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continued to enable Pay with Venmo with more merchants and partners, including eBay and StubHub, which we expect will continue to fuel this growth. Our recently launched Venmo Teen Accounts is showing encouraging early traction, expanding our addressable market, and helping us build lifelong relationships with customers from an early age. What excites me most about Venmo is that we are only scratching the surface of its potential, starting to drive customer-led, profitable innovation, and we see substantial headroom for growth. Said simply, Venmo is primed for growth. Finally, consumers who love PayPal for online purchases are also telling merchants they want to use PayPal for their offline purchases. We continue to drive the adoption of our card products, and we're making it easier to add PayPal and Venmo branded cards to Apple and Google wallets on mobile devices. We are also looking forward to launching even more ways for consumers to use PayPal anytime, anyplace with NFC technology starting in Europe. Expect to see more from us in the coming quarters to enable and incentivize our customers to use PayPal online and in person. Reflecting on the quarter and looking ahead, I want to thank the PayPal team for continuing to work tirelessly as we transform our company and give our customers the best possible experiences. With that, over to Jamie. Jamie Miller : Thanks Alex. Good morning everyone. Moving to Slide 6, PayPal delivered strong second quarter results and we are raising our full year guidance. We're passing through the first half performance and increasing second half growth investments as we build confidence in initiatives across the company. Our goal for 2024 remains the same, to set PayPal up for long-term success by prioritizing investments that will deliver durable, profitable growth. As Alex mentioned, while the second quarter produced another improving set of results, change takes time and can sometimes be uneven. The success of our transformation will be measured over quarters and years. We have a lot of work ahead but the teams are making progress and building on a strong foundation visible in our first half results. Looking at the high-level financial results in the second quarter, revenue increased 8% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8% year-over-year, a more than 300 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19, representing 36% year-over-year growth. And relative to our prior expectations, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including stronger transaction margin dollar growth and interest income. Turning to Slide 7, our financial results are a function of the number of customers we have, how engaged they are across our platform, and how frequently they transact with us. Our operating metrics reflect progress on this front. We ended the second quarter with 429 million total active accounts and 222 million monthly active accounts. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the first quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts in addition to other products. We were encouraged to see sustained total active account growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 3% year-over-year to $222 million with contributions from both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11%. Excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, transactions per active account grew 6%. Moving to Slide 8, total payment volume grew 11% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $417 billion. US TPV grew 11%. International TPV also grew 11% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in continental Europe and Asia. Looking at the breakdown by product, global branded checkout volumes grew 6% on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter. This was consistent with our first quarter performance, which increased 6%, excluding a one-point benefit from the additional leap day. Within branded checkout, we continue to see strength across large enterprise platforms, marketplaces, and international growth. We remain laser-focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small and medium businesses and improving our mobile experiences, which are critical, particularly in markets like the US. And the UK PSP processing volume grew 19% in the quarter compared to 26% in the first quarter. Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefit of our shift in strategy to drive profitable growth. Our focus on price to value is having an impact with Braintree now contributing positively to transaction margin dollar growth in a meaningful way. Moving to more financial detail on slide 9, transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.2 billion driven primarily by Braintree, Branded Checkout, and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter was close to flat at $732 million. Interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind to OVAS revenue and contributed approximately 3 points to transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. Revenue within our credit business declined year-over-year but performed in-line with expectations. Part of the decline is due to proactive decisions made last year to manage risk and reduce on-balance sheet merchant receivables. We are also seeing ongoing normalization of loss rates within our off-balance sheet US Consumer revolving portfolio. Overall, we have taken steps over the last year to actively manage the credit portfolio's exposure and are continuing to position the portfolio to move toward a less capital-intensive business model. Transaction take rate declined by 3 basis points to 1.72% compared to a 5 basis point decline last quarter. PSP Volumes and Venmo benefited transaction take rate, which was offset by faster large enterprise growth within our branded checkout business, foreign exchange fees, and an acceleration in other merchant services, including payouts. Transaction margin dollars increased 8% in the second quarter compared to a 4% increase in the first quarter. Higher interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Braintree, and Venmo were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. Branded checkout and Venmo's strong transaction margin results benefited from ongoing efforts to improve and optimize transaction loss performance as well as some transaction expense favorability. While it's still early, we are encouraged to see initial actions related to price value, as well as product and ongoing risk enhancements make a positive impact. Relative to last quarter, we saw Braintree return to profitable growth and improvements in the contribution from Venmo, Branded Checkout, and P2P. Non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 1% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure, while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 24% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.5% benefiting from expense leverage and improvement in transaction margin trends. PayPal generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of more than $18 billion and debt of just over $12 billion. Moving to guidance on Slide 10 for the third quarter and the full year in 2024, for the remainder of the year, we continue to guide, assuming a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS to grow by high single digits. We are raising our guidance for the full year and now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow in the low to mid-teens. This increase reflects outperformance in the second quarter, as well as a slightly more positive view of the second half of the year, with some strategic reinvestment into growth initiatives. Underpinning our guidance, we now expect transaction margin dollars to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage for the full year. We have seen steady profitable growth from our branded checkout business and feel confident in the progress our teams are making. It is encouraging to see the initial impact of our initiatives related to price to value, as well as ongoing product enhancements in areas like P2P. Some of our efforts, particularly on the innovation side, are still early and will take time to scale. But we are encouraged by the initial results and customer response, as we begin moving from the test and pilot phases into launch. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to continue to make progress on these fronts, but there are a few factors to keep in mind. Consistent with the strategy we laid out in prior quarters, our teams continue to prioritize high-quality, profitable growth as we execute against our long-term roadmap. Related to this, we expect lower volume and revenue growth as we move through the second half of the year. This is deliberate, and it shows good progress. By strategically focusing on price-to-value in areas like large enterprise processing within Braintree, we are driving transaction margin dollar improvements even on a lower volume growth. Offsetting some of these improvements, we expect a much smaller tailwind from growth and interest on customer balances, which represented an approximately 3 percentage point tailwind to transaction margin dollar growth in the first half. We were also planning prudently and forecasting less favorability with some normalization in transaction and credit losses. We continue to expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly with ongoing efficiency funding our strategic growth investments. Our investment spending will ramp as the year progresses to support our highest priority growth initiatives that go-to-market of new products, partnerships, and innovation, as well as reinvigorated marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo. These investments are all in support of re-accelerating durable, profitable growth for the company. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 free cashflow guidance to approximately $6 billion. We are also increasing our share buyback plan to $6 billion compared to our prior guidance for at least $5 billion. In closing, we've been making good progress throughout the first half of 2024, as we drive significant change across the company. We have clear opportunities to lean in further and ensure we stay on offense in what remains a competitive and dynamic environment. We're excited about the path forward and look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, back to you, Alex. Alex Chriss : Thank you, Jamie. To summarize, PayPal grew profitably again with strength in multiple areas, including branded, unbranded, and Venmo. We are also starting to see traction in several initiatives. Taken together, these results highlight the strength of PayPal's global commerce platform. I'll leave you with one last example. You've heard me talk about our Venmo customers, looking for us to provide more money in and money out opportunities. As we are improving opportunities to spend Venmo balance with products like Venmo debit card or pay with Venmo, we are seeing a corresponding improvement in funds being used within the Venmo ecosystem rather than transferred out. This is an example of meeting our customers where they are, solving their needs, and driving monetization and margin improvement in the process. Overall, this was a strong quarter for PayPal, and it gives us the confidence to both increase our growth investments and raise our full year profit and free cash flow guide. I'm proud of our team and excited about the coming quarters and years for PayPal. Steve, let's go to Q&A. Steve Winoker : Thanks Alex. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Sarah, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question and great to see all the progress that you're making. Branded volumes maintain the X-leap year growth rate from last quarter. Can you drill down a bit more into your strategy to drive branded growth acceleration? You mentioned it focused on mobile vaulting user interface. What are the most important levers? And then maybe also, did Jamie's comments on lower volume right there at the end of the prepared remarks in the second half apply to both branded and unbranded volumes? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah, thanks for the question, Ramsey. You know, we're excited to see the progress that we've made on branded. As you can see, we've got a consistent, loyal customer base that continues to use and love PayPal. What we've been focused on over the last six months is really some of the things I've touched on before, the experiences particularly around mobile. I touched on some of it in the comments, but the teams are working night and day now to improve everything from the vaulted experience, which is essential on mobile. This is think of high usage, high repeat usage checkout experience where you actually vault PayPal as your default. We've now improved that experience. And as I mentioned, we're seeing a 75 to 110 basis point lift with our new experience. We're also rolling out a new pay sheet experience overall, which simplifies, gives customers still the choice of whether they're using PayPal Balance or any instrument they want, as well as buy-now, pay-later, but just simplifying the experience. And We are seeing a nice lift in conversion rate there as well. So big focus on the end-to-end customer experience. We feel like that combined with the ubiquity that we have just in marks across both mobile and web gives us the ability to continue to not only maintain, but where we want to be, which is taking share in the branded experience. Jamie Miller : Great. And Ramsey, on the second part of your question about lower volumes in the second half, that primarily relates to Braintree. We are seeing both lapping of larger wins this year, particularly in the second half, and some shifting and normalization in the Braintree revenue profile, just as we enter into and really get into the process of working with our customers around our mission around profitable growth. But on the branded checkout side of things, we expect the second half to be consistent with the first. July is off to a good start. What we've seen in July is very consistent with the first half so far. So we feel pretty good about that. Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darren Peller with Wolf Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey, guys. Thanks, and nice results, especially on the transaction margin side. So I'll just start there and touch on the dynamics around what's contributing to it from mix versus you talked a lot about pricing per value, which we've heard more and more about in the industry also, so it's good to see, but maybe more direction and color on the contributing forces. And adding onto that, the sustainability of the strength you saw this quarter in growing transaction margin dollars at these rates. Help us understand your expectations there going forward now. Obviously, you updated guidance, but really beyond just the next few months. Thanks, guys. Jamie Miller : Yeah, so good morning, Darrin. Thank you. So maybe I'll start with the biggest contributors to transaction margin dollar growth and talk a little bit about the second half there as well. So we were really excited to see the broad base strengths and the acceleration. There's a lot the team has underway and there's several significant contributors to the growth. First, we talked about in my prepared remarks, interest income on customer balances. That was about 3 points in the first half. But second, and really very strong was branded checkout. It continues to grow profitably as a healthy contributor to transaction margin dollar growth. Braintree, which you mentioned, it is back to contributing to transaction margin dollar growth, which we're really excited about. And it's really great to see some progress from our shift in focus there. Venmo continues to benefit not only from the strong consumer, but, you know, we're doing a nice job in Venmo too, driving continued growth in monthly actives. And then lastly, transaction loss favorability continued to be favorable in the second quarter as well, which was nice to see. When we think about the second half, there is really a couple of things to think about there. I'd say first is that our first half tailwinds around interest income, you know, will begin to decline. We've just got higher comps in the second half of 2023, as rates were coming up in the second half of last year. So that impact on transaction margin dollar growth, the percentage, that'll start to come down. The second is that we saw transaction loss favorability in both the first quarter and the second quarter. It is feeling more durable than we expected, even in the first quarter. Having said that, we're planning for some normalization in the second half. As we get better in transaction loss prevention and detection. So do bad actors, and they continue to work hard to do different things. And the second is we are launching a number of products in the second half. And any time you launch products, we're just being prudent around how we think about transaction loss to make sure that if we have a few bugs in the process, we're working the kinks out as we go. But the core business is solid. We are more positive than we were three months ago on Braintree profitability, P2P, on transaction loss. It's still early in our progress but we're driving significant change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks. Good results here. I wanted to ask about the second half growth and investments. It looks like in your guidance you're applying a fourth quarter step down in EPS performance there. So does that, should we assume that that's heavy marketing around the holiday? Can you maybe just give a little bit more specifics on what you're marketing exactly and what kind of return you're expecting? Thanks. Jamie Miller : Hi, Tien-Tsin. Good morning. I'll take the first part, and then maybe Alex will want to comment on the marketing pieces of it. So in the first half, we've done, I think, a really nice job with expense discipline. We've taken a number of actions to reduce our OpEx profile, while at the same time remixing or prioritizing investment back into engineering product and some marketing. Now we intentionally deferred in the first half some marketing dollars to the second half. So when you look at the second half profile, you're seeing the same underlying core reinvestment in engineering and go-to-market and things like that. But you're also seeing a much bigger ramp in our marketing spend, you know, around marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo. But really also around these product launches, really making sure we put our marketing dollars to work to have that hit the ground running the way we need to. So in the second half, when you think about the EPS guide side of it, more than half of that 4Q pressure is the ramping of those growth investments. The other side, I'll just mention this quickly while around the topic, is that we've got a higher tax rate in the second half than we have in the first half. And so that, particularly on a comparative basis to last year, is what's impacting some of the EPS profile? Alex Chriss : Yeah, and just to pile on and dig a little bit deeper, you know, this is very deliberate. The first half of the year, we needed to invest in innovation and invest in the customer experiences and put to market experiences on both PayPal and Venmo from a consumer standpoint that we can be proud of. I feel like we are at that place now. The experience on the PayPal app, what we are putting out on branded experiences, and even just the engagements, just the new designs, the shopping and rewards that now exist inside of the PayPal app is completely rebuilt and new. On the Venmo side, you've seen the improvement as we started to create real onboarding ramps for our debit card, and we are seeing the improvement there. So feeling really good about the experiences on both of the apps and it's time to tell the world about it. And we are excited to ramp up some of our go-to-market spend in sort of exciting and engaging ways. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open. Harshita Rawat : Hi, good morning. Alex, I want to ask about Europe. Historically PayPal has grown in the region despite not investing enough. How are you thinking about Europe among PayPal's international markets? Looks like the company has a very strong local presence and the regulatory environment is now more favorable with respect to NFC access [iPhone] (ph)? Thank you. Alex Chriss : Yeah, I think it's a great question, and it's one of the things that we may overlook sometimes when we just think about PayPal. We are a global company, and the way customers use us, whether it be cross-border, whether it be access to merchants all over the world, is truly a global phenomenon. We've invested heavily over the years in ensuring that we are compliant in everywhere that we want to be in over 200 different markets. You know, as we think about our strategy, as I've laid out in the past, to make sure that PayPal is available everywhere for every purchase every time. That includes being able to be available in an omnichannel solution, whether it's e-commerce or whether it's in-person. And with some of the changes coming particularly in Europe around NFC, that opens up the opportunity for us and we will be prepared shortly to be able to play in that space. So it's exciting to see our growth. I'll hit one more example. Our buy now pay later growth that we continue to see, 60% of that volume comes from outside of the US. So we are bringing the entire ecosystem of what PayPal brings to the global stage and excited to continue to invest there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian : Great, thanks, and good morning to everybody. I was curious on the SMB initiatives, in particular the strategy to drive more adoption of branded checkouts, how important Fastlane is that initiative. And then also, if you think advertising can be ultimately a lever for that side of the business as well on both sides of the network. Thank you. Alex Chriss : Yeah, it's a great question. And SMB, as I've said since I got here, I think is an untapped opportunity for us. So let's just pull back and talk about what SMBs really need. Small businesses are there fighting for every customer. They need to be able to find customers, they need to be able to engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them. And really what they're looking for is an end-to-end platform and an end-to-end solution to help them. It is very difficult for a small business to piece together 17 different solutions. They just don't have the bandwidth, the people, and the time to be able to make that happen. With PPCP, we now have put together the most powerful single platform for them to be able to run their business in a full stack manner. So with PPCP, you now get branded experiences with the best branded experiences. You get access to the best guest checkout conversion with Fastlane. You get unbranded processing so that you can ensure that you can process anywhere around the world. You get every mark. You get buy-now pay-later. You get access to our working capital. And then as you mentioned, now that we start to roll out our ads platform, you get the ability to drive new customers. You also get the ability to re-engage with customers in a delightful way, so package tracking, smart receipts, the ability to be able to re-market to customers even after they've purchased. All of this is in one place with one partner. And so, you know, we're in early days right now. PPCP really is just rolling out. We're excited about the progress and the growth, but there's a lot more to play here. Live in 30 markets and through 40 partner channels. But I think we're just getting started. This is going to play out over the next few years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Good morning. It's nice to hear about the accelerated general availability of Fastlane. Maybe you could talk about what it means from a revenue contribution standpoint. And if not this year, maybe we could just talk about how we should think about the revenue contribution. Would it be through more engagement? And then maybe just secondly, if you could just talk about the volume trends. It seemed like US was pretty stable, international dropped off. Maybe you could fill a bit more color there would be helpful. Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah, let me start with Fastlane. So just as a reminder for everyone, Fastlane is really tackling the 60% of checkout that is guest checkout. We've got a unique experience because of the volume of our two-sided network and the consumers that we see coming in, where we're able to dramatically change the conversion rate for repeat users. So 80% conversion rate versus a traditional roughly 50% on a repeat user. Our goal is to capture and help all merchants for all guest checkouts. So the way we built Fastlane is this really is a platform that can be processed or agnostic. And we want to be able to help every consumer come through and have a delightful guest checkout experience. As well as enable actually our ability to capture them through a Fastlane by PayPal experience and bring them into a branded experience as well. So there's a flywheel effect. In terms of rollout, we're rolling this out now. We've got a developer day situated in a few weeks from this time in August. We're going GA now in August as well, and so we'll be ramping up as many customers as we can. We've not talked about and disclosed pricing on this, so I'm not going to get into that at this point. But know that this is our ability to monetize not just guest checkout that we process through Braintree but really for us the total addressable market is the entire guest checkout experience across the board. Jamie Miller : Yeah and on the second part of your question around the US and international environments, you know as I mentioned before we see the US environment being very consistent right now with what we've seen over the first half. International is a real strength for us and we did have a shift, down a bit in the international area on TPV this quarter, but when you look at that, what that really is, it's almost solely related to lapping some large Braintree [wins] (ph) last year, otherwise very healthy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Great results. I wanted to ask you, Alex a little bit about the competitive positioning regarding Apple Pay. Obviously, really strong branded checkout. There has been some worries in the past. Can you maybe contextualize a little bit where we are and you know what you're doing to beat them? Thank you. Alex Chriss : Yeah thanks Dan, great question. So let me set some context. So first we play in a massive multi-trillion dollar market and it's not a zero-sum game. So we expect competitors, we've had competitors come in since we launched, you know, over a decade ago. We went from one button to now there's lots of different buttons and branded experiences and we'll expect that to continue. Let me, though, set the context of the reality of today, and then how we think about the future. So the reality today, we are the Number #1 branded experience across all platforms and devices. If we narrow down into desktop web, which is still 40% to 50% of all checkout, we see no degradation in our share over the past four years. So let me say that again. We've held share despite competition. Second, if we look across browsers, there's actually no difference in our selection rate across different browsers. So certain buttons moving from one platform to the other just isn't material to us. So that's where we are today. So let us focus around our ability to continue to improve and make this a better experience for our consumers going forward. So for merchants, they're looking for an end-to-end solution. They want to get customers, they want to convert customers, and they want to engage and have a return experience with customers. As we talked about, we now have the best branded experience. We're continuing to improve that. We have Fastlane, we have the best checkout experience. And we've rolled out ads and continuing to invest in our profiles. So we are helping merchants end-to-end. On a consumer side, they're looking for ubiquity, flexibility, and a rewarding experience. We are the most ubiquitous. We have 80% acceptance rate in the developed world with a large and growing customer base. And from a flexibility standpoint, they want to be able to pay everywhere with any way that they can -- that they want to pay and we're able to provide that. So if you pull back, I'm just excited that we are in a strong position of being the most complete platform and two-sided global network, driving the highest value and benefit to our consumers and our merchants. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS Financial. Your line is open. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to drill into, branded checkout a little bit with the 6% growth. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the relative levels of growth, US versus International. Branded, you did call out the strength and international with continental Europe and Asia. And then also on the relative levels of transaction margin, given that there are some differences in transaction expense levels and also potentially merchant size mix. Would appreciate those. Thanks. Jamie Miller : Yeah, so on a relative level of growth, US and international, both continue to be strong contributors for us. There's obviously different market mixes and different [merchant] (ph) mixes, as you look at those growth profiles. You know, in the US, large enterprises continue to be an area of strength for us. And I would say, in the small business area, we continue to remix that portfolio as we move to PPCP and off of legacy platforms and really move to both a direct and a partner strategy there. You know, when you look at the international side of things, branded checkout is very, very strong in several European, both countries and corridors. UK continues to be pressured, but I would say outside of that, we've got real strength in other countries such as Germany and just real bright spots in Europe as well. So I'd say it is fairly balanced across the globe when you look at it. I'm trying to look at the second part of your question here. Transaction expense. You know, when you look at transaction expense, it is impacted by funding mix, product mix, geo mix, all of that stuff. Funding mix relatively stable. The biggest driver of our shift in TE right now is been Braintree, and that continues to be what is happening there. We're always looking at ways to continuously improve our transaction expense profile and work with different partners to move the needle on that. And we continue to have different benefits, different quarters just in terms of how that rolls-through, none of which was particularly material, but we had a little bit of that too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning guys, thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the full year guide for the transaction profit dollar growth. Obviously you're ticking that up here. It does imply the deceleration in the second half that you mentioned around flow comps, et cetera. What I'm trying to get a sense of, has your full year outlook for transaction profit dollar growth from the core branded and Braintree businesses changed, just to kind of isolate the delta here in the guidance? Jamie Miller : Yeah, I would say generally we are seeing a stronger branded baseline and we're having increasing confidence in the slope of our Braintree profitability efforts. That's what I would say on those two. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great, thank you so much. Want to circle back to Fastlane and obviously a lot of interest and excitement in terms of its launch timing, et cetera. And I think you've made it pretty clear that this will be kind of a gradual opportunity that will build on it and addressing a big market. How should we think about, like, what your key to-dos are as we go through the rest of this year and into next year? And I'm wondering if any of Fastlane with the launch timing is now built into the guidance, as well as any other new initiatives that may have been added into guidance for the rest of the year. Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah, let me start with the last part. We really not built any Fastlane upside into guidance. And part of that is because of our go-to-market is going to be very focused on just getting adoption, not around monetizing in this half of the year. Now, to be clear, we are pricing in the contracts that we're signing with customers, and so pricing is built in and as I said before, the TAM is every guest checkout. That's what our focus is. But it's not built into the second half of the year. In terms of key to-dos, we really created and worked hard during this beta period to create a seamless experience so that developers and merchants can get on board as fast as possible. And so, you know, for someone using us now, it is really a four to four week experience to get onto the Fastlane code and enable that to roll out. So we need to get it on as many platforms as we can, so that small businesses in particular can just one click a button and turn it on for the holidays. We are working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well. But again, look, the reality is we've got a lot of merchants around the world, and it is going to take time for them to be able to put this into their roadmap. So that's why we want to set expectations that this is going to take quarters and years to get everyone on board. But the beauty of Fastlane is it's a network effect. More customers coming through it, we are already seeing best-in-class conversion rates. The more customers that come through it, the more profiles that we start to capture, and the better the conversion rates should become. So we want to get started as fast as possible, get as many merchants through this holiday season as we can, and then build from there. Steve Winoker : Sarah, let's make time for one last question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Schmidt : Hey Alex and Jamie. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to double-click just on the Braintree trends. Obviously, good progress in terms of transaction margin dollar growth. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that, clearly more disciplined, lapping of large contracts? And then as we look to the back half and beyond, I hear you on the slope that's kind of built into the outlook. But from what you've seen so far, how does it inform your confidence in terms of building on the progress that you've seen so far in transaction margin dollar growth as we go into the back half in the subsequent years? Thanks a lot. Jamie Miller : So, good morning Andrew. Thank you. So first well, let's just talk through the Braintree growth and what's really driving that. We set out this year to really reorient the team with Braintree around profitable growth. And as we've done that -- we've had just a number of conversations with customers, both around contract renewal, but also just around our holistic relationship and really getting into understanding how we partner, what the margin structure is, how we provide value-added services, just the overall value-to-value exchange that we have got. And honestly, they've been really positive conversations as we -- and just on a total relationship basis sort of thing. As we looked at that, there are certain situations where as we've gotten into the discussion, we are willing to accept a lower share of revenue in exchange for a higher margin contract. There is other situations where, as we work with our customers, we are able to sell in value-added services in ways that we just haven't done before. So it is lots of different levers in that process. But what we are excited about is we are really starting to see good traction on that. It is intentional. We've set out to do this. And it is a really good thing for the business. And I think as you look at the second half, what we saw play out in the second quarter, I expect to continue. We saw some of the volume growth normalize a bit, but we saw more positive transaction margin dollar growth. And it is really good to see that tangible progress play out. And I think it will continue to play out over time. It may be a little bit uneven and not linear, but that trend of a little bit more normalization into the business, but improving margin profiles is something we fully expect to continue. Steve Winoker : Alex, I think you have time for any final comments you might have? Jamie Miller : Yes. Thank you all today, and thanks Steve. Just to close the call, company is energized. We are proud of what we've accomplished, just to again, sort of step -- set the context of where we are. We are really six months in. We've got a new leadership team. We are getting stronger every day. We've returned the company to transaction margin growth. We've returned the company to a consumer user growth. We significantly improved profitability at Braintree, and we are accelerating Venmo. And so I just feel really proud that we are stronger today than we were six months ago, and we will be stronger six months from now than we are today. And we are executing against our game plan. This will be measured in quarters and years. So it will be a long game, but six months in, we are on the right trajectory. So thank you all for today and see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead. Steve Winoker : Thanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by CEO, Alex Chriss; and CFO, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to you, Alex. Alex Chriss : Thanks, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal had a highly productive third quarter. We made good progress on our continued transformation, while delivering strong operating and financial results. We brought multiple innovations to market, coupled with a significant new marketing campaign and are seeing encouraging early adoption. And we continue to forge important partnerships with leaders in global commerce. We are early in our transformation journey, and we have a lot of work ahead to get to where we want to be. However, I'm proud of what we've been able to achieve in the last year, and it gives me conviction that we're taking the necessary steps to unlock the full potential of PayPal and Venmo over time. We've assembled a world-class leadership team, reignited innovation for our customers and are now moving with clear purpose and increased velocity. We're leaning into our competitive advantage, a two-sided network of hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of millions of merchants around the world to evolve from a set of disparate payment products and point solutions into a powerful commerce platform. As we shift from a payments company to a commerce platform, more of the world's leading commerce players have partnered with us to add value for our mutual customers. In just over two months, we've announced partnerships with Fiserv, Adyen, Amazon, Global Payments and Shopify, and we're actively discussing more collaborations across the industry. These new and expanded relationships are a clear demonstration that our brand, innovations and momentum are resonating. Before we discuss this quarter's details, I'm excited to announce that we will host an Investor Day on February 25 in New York City. We look forward to seeing many of you in person in sharing our team's longer-term strategy, key opportunities, financial and operating targets and how we will get there. Now turning to our Q3 results. Total payment volume grew 9% to $423 billion. We delivered $7.8 billion in revenue, growing 6% on a currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8% to $3.7 billion and were up 6%, excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 22% year-over-year. Importantly, this translated into significant free cash flow. We're proud of these results and have a clear plan to drive continued profitable growth over the long-term. After another strong quarter, we're raising our full year guidance for transaction margin dollars and non-GAAP earnings per share. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in areas that we believe will drive long-term profitable growth. Let me update you on our customer business strategies and the promising early results we're seeing. When I joined, it was clear that we had significant work to do to improve branded checkout. PayPal had fallen behind on innovation, and we had work to do to be more competitive, particularly on mobile devices. In January, we shared new mobile checkout experiences designed to significantly improve conversion. We've completed testing over the past few quarters and are now rolling out to customers new experiences on both desktop and mobile. These new checkout experiences are second to none. When implemented properly, the new product experiences are resulting on average in more than 100 basis points of conversion lift for vaulted checkout and up to 400 basis points of conversion uplift for one-time checkout. We're also seeing a 15% to 20% increase in Buy Now, Pay Later use. These experiences are live on close to 5% of our U.S. checkout traffic today, and we're pushing hard to get them into the hands of more of our merchants throughout the holiday shopping season and into next year. I'm proud of our team's innovation velocity as we reestablish ourselves as the best converting branded experience for consumers and merchants. Continuing in large enterprise. We're making solid progress on our initiative to price our services in a way that reflects the current value we bring to our merchants. This is now the second consecutive quarter in more than two years, that Braintree is meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth. We're having very constructive conversations with our merchants, focused on ways we can enable strategic growth opportunities that drive long-term upside for both of us. What is different today is that we now have a suite of value added services, including payouts, risk as a service, orchestration, guest checkout and personalization capabilities that help attract new customers and convert them more effectively, in addition to world-class payment processing. We're excited about our progress here as it is key to long-term value creation. Finally, we're pleased with the initial reaction to Fastlane, which targets the 60% of e-commerce purchases made without a branded mark. Since we launched in August, we have over 1,000 merchants using Fastlane to provide a seamless experience to their customers and drive increased conversion. We've also reached a new milestone in our ability to recognize and auto fill information for first-time Fastlane users. In the U.S., 170 million eligible customer profiles on the PayPal platform can now enjoy a seamless guest checkout, the very first time they try Fastlane. The scale of consumers who are primed to spend with PayPal puts us way ahead of other guest checkout solutions, and it is one of the reasons why so many platforms are choosing to partner with us. We can't wait to get Fastlane into the hands of more merchants, not only on Braintree and PPCP, but also through our partnerships with Fiserv, Adyen and Global Payments next year. Moving to small and medium-sized businesses. Last month, we launched PayPal Complete Payments in new geographies, including China and Hong Kong with more market on the horizon in 2025. In the markets where PPCP is live, we're steadily converting volume from our legacy products with nearly 40% of our SMB processing and checkout volume now on this platform. What is important to remember is that many of these merchants are using PayPal for both branded and unbranded payments, an example of the benefits that come with integrated solutions. PayPal Complete Payments also allows us to work with many small and medium-sized businesses through partner platforms, including Shopify. As we announced in the quarter, PayPal is now an additional processor for Shopify Payments in the U.S. Our branded checkout solutions are now integrated into Shopify Payments, creating a single, unified experience for time constrained business owners to drive operational efficiency. We also recently announced a partnership with Amazon to bring PayPal Checkout to SMBs offering Buy with Prime. Next year, we will expand our work together to give Prime members the option to link their Amazon and PayPal accounts so that consumers can receive Prime shipping benefits when they use PayPal, while shopping with Buy with Prime. While they will take time to realize, there is significant opportunity here and more we can do to better serve the needs of small businesses. For consumers, we're redefining our value proposition with last month's launch of PayPal Everywhere. This initiative builds on PayPal's established brand position as an online shopping powerhouse to position PayPal as the go-to solution for spending, sending and earning rewards whether online or offline. We're doing this through cashback incentives on the PayPal debit card, a marketing campaign with the goal of reintroducing our capabilities to consumers, who may never have thought about PayPal as more than an online payment option. We're starting to shift perceptions of PayPal and beginning to drive adoption of our suite of complementary products, which all drive back to branded checkout. The broader awareness and perception shift we're aiming for is not going to happen overnight. This is an area where we plan to continue to invest over time. That said, we're seeing early signs that give us confidence our strategy is working. Since we launched PayPal Everywhere, we've added more than 1 million first-time debit card users. As a reminder, we're allowing consumers to pick a cashback category of their choice each month, which is capped at $50 per month. The top three categories, customers are choosing and earning rewards for us so far are groceries, gas and restaurants. What gets me so excited is that we're now seeing customers make daily in-person purchases with their PayPal debit card. In addition, these debit card users are now choosing PayPal branded checkout more frequently when they shop online. Early data from our existing customers shows a 5x increase in total omni spend within the first two weeks of sign-up. We plan to expand the PayPal Everywhere value proposition to Europe next year, incorporating learnings from our U.S. launch. We expect the availability of NFC capabilities will help drive further adoption and use of PayPal. With Venmo, we're making progress in executing our strategy to shift from solely a P2P service to a central part of consumers' financial lives. Our new leadership team is taking a fresh look at Venmo, and we're completely transforming and upgrading the user experience. We know that we inherited one of the strongest P2P brands and see an opportunity to prioritize innovations that unlock Venmo's value. We believe that Venmo will eventually have multiple monetization levers. In the short-term, we see two meaningful contributors. Let me unpack each of them. First is the Venmo debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance, both online and offline. We're in the early days of driving adoption, but we're seeing encouraging trends in engagement and monetization. In the quarter, monthly active debit card accounts grew 30% yet again. This is exciting as the average revenue per account is 4 times that of all Venmo accounts. However, only 5% of Venmo active accounts are monthly active Venmo debit card users demonstrating the opportunity ahead of us. The second lever is Pay with Venmo, which provides a seamless way to pay online. The strategy with Pay with Venmo involves both consumer and merchant adoption. On the consumer side, 8% of Venmo active accounts are monthly active Pay with Venmo users, so we have room to grow. Monthly active Pay with Venmo users were up 20% in the quarter, and the average revenue per account is 3 times that of all Venmo accounts. On the merchant side, we will bundle Pay with Venmo with PayPal Checkout in our go-to-market motions to accelerate distribution. With these product improvements in place, we're now leaning into marketing for Venmo for the first-time in years. We will continue to build on this foundation and obsess over consumer needs and our product to fully unlock the brand's long-term potential as a multibillion dollar franchise. I want to thank the PayPal team for their continued commitment to transforming our company and making it even stronger. We've got the right team in place and we're playing to win. With that, over to Jamie. Jamie Miller : Thanks, Alex. Moving to Slide 7. PayPal delivered another strong quarter of results. The underlying stability and consistency of the business is encouraging, and we remain focused on advancing our transformation to drive durable, profitable growth. Change takes time, and we still have a lot of work ahead, but the team is making steady progress on top of an already solid foundation. Looking at the high level financial results in the quarter, revenue increased 6% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars accelerated slightly from the second quarter, in addition to a nearly 3 point benefit from interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Venmo, Braintree, and better transaction loss performance contributed to growth in the quarter. Our focus on price to value is paying off with Braintree again contributing materially to transaction margin dollars even as volume and revenue growth deliberately slows. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.20, representing 22% year-over-year growth. Relative to our guidance, outperformance was driven by a number of factors, including continued optimization of transaction loss, Venmo and improvements in credit. Turning to Slide 8. Our operating metrics reflect another quarter of progress. Total active accounts increased by nearly 3 million from the second quarter to 432 million. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 223 million with contributions from PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12 month number were 61.4 in the third quarter, up 9%. Excluding PSP processing, transactions per active grew 5%. Moving to Slide 9. Total payment volume grew 9% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $423 billion. Looking at the breakdown by product, global branded checkout volumes grew 6% on a currency neutral basis in the third quarter, consistent with the mid-single digit growth we've seen for the last three years. Within branded checkout, we continue to see strength across large enterprise platforms, marketplaces and international merchants. As Alex mentioned, our team is hard at work to drive wider coverage of our most modern best-in-class checkout experiences. We are particularly focused on small and medium businesses and mobile, both critically important areas for us to improve our positioning. PSP processing volume grew 11% compared to 19% in the second quarter. As part of our price-to-value strategy, we are moving deliberately and making decisions that prioritize healthy, profitable growth rather than targeting a high proportion of processing volume at low or even negative margins. What this looks like in practice with some of our largest enterprise customers is often a renegotiated agreement that reduces our total share of payment processing to a more balanced level. So for example, from 95% to 75%, but with better economics and with a greater breadth of products and services. This means we are driving Braintree transaction margin dollar improvements and more strategic partnerships, but with lower volume and revenue growth. Moving to more financial detail on Slide 10. Transaction revenue grew 6% on a spot basis to $7.1 billion, driven primarily by Braintree, branded checkout and Venmo. Other value added services revenue in the quarter increased 2% to $780 million, and interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind to OVAS and credit revenue was under less pressure compared to the past three quarters. We have now fully lapped the actions taken last year to tighten credit underwriting and reduce on balance sheet risk. We're seeing better performance across the portfolio and have now started to modestly grow merchant originations. We'll continue to prudently manage the portfolio's exposure with the goal of sustaining our balance sheet light business model, while providing our customers with more ways to manage their cash flow, spending and borrowing needs. Transaction take rate declined by 4 basis points to 1.67% compared to a 3 basis point decline last quarter. Improvements in Braintree and Venmo monetization benefited transaction take rate. These were offset by large enterprise and marketplace growth within branded checkout, foreign exchange and faster payouts growth. Turning to transaction margin dollar growth. As I said earlier, interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Venmo and Braintree were the largest contributors. Results in the quarter continue to benefit from efforts to optimize transaction loss performance with more advanced data analytics and some transaction expense favorability. Non-transaction related operating expenses increased 3% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives, including marketing that was deferred from the first half of the year and the rollout of new products and initiatives like PayPal Everywhere. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 194 basis points to 18.8%, benefiting from transaction margin expansion as well as expense leverage. PayPal generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. We completed $1.8 billion in share repurchases, bringing the total number of share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5.4 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $16.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $12.4 billion in debt. Moving to guidance on Slide 11 for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024. We continue to assume a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow by a low-single digit percentage. This is directly related to Braintree merchant negotiations and ongoing efforts to drive quality, profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, this is a deliberate action and a continuation of the strategy we've articulated throughout the year, where we have accepted a lower near-term Braintree revenue profile in exchange for better margins as we have renegotiated agreements. As a result of these efforts, we expect lower Braintree volume and revenue growth in the fourth quarter and through 2025 before reaccelerating from the reset baseline. This is a healthy profitable trade-off for the business that benefits transaction margin dollar growth and build stronger, more strategic relationships. We expect higher non-transaction OpEx growth in the fourth quarter as we have intentionally concentrated more of our discretionary investment spend, particularly in marketing during the back half of the year and in the holiday season. This is strategically timed to support key initiatives, including the go-to-market of new products and innovation, as well as ongoing marketing and brand campaigns for PayPal and Venmo. Due to this timing, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to decrease by a low to mid-single digit percentage. 2024's full year non-transaction OpEx growth rate, which we now expect to increase in the low-single digit range is a reasonable way to think about the OpEx profile for the business next year. But like this year, we expect some unevenness in any given quarter. Moving to the full year in more detail. We are raising our guidance for transaction margin dollars and non-GAAP earnings per share. This increase reflects outperformance in the third quarter as well as strategic reinvestments back into growth initiatives. We now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow in the high-teens and full year transaction margin dollars to increase by a mid-single digit percentage. We have seen steady profitable growth from our branded checkout business, and the teams are advancing our checkout initiatives. I'm encouraged by the rollout of innovation, the initial impact of our price-to-value strategy, ongoing product enhancements in areas like Venmo and P2P and the customer response to the launch of PayPal Everywhere. As we move into the fourth quarter and beyond, we expect to continue making progress, but there are a few factors to keep in mind. Through the first three quarters of the year, growth in interest on customer balances and improvements to transaction loss were an approximately 4 point percentage benefit to transaction margin dollars. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we expect minimal benefit from growth and interest on customer balances and then a headwind beginning in 2025 due to interest rate cuts. We're also planning for some normalization and transaction losses as we roll out new products. We now expect full year non-transaction operating expenses to increase in the low-single digit range with ongoing cost efficiency helping to fund our strategic growth investments. As we move into next year, our focus will be on striking the right balance between investment and productivity, seeking to largely fund long-term investments through savings generated from better deployment of tech and automation. We continue to expect 2024 free cash flow of approximately $6 billion and continue to plan for $6 billion of share buyback this year. In closing, I'd like to thank the PayPal team for their ongoing dedication as we drive meaningful change to strengthen our foundation for profitable growth. We are continuing to execute and we're making good progress and we're excited to share more with you at our Investor Day in February. With that, back to you, Alex. Alex Chriss : Today, I am more confident than ever about our future. We have a durable and differentiated market position and a strong brand that we continue to aggressively invest in. PayPal has a massive global opportunity. We have the right team in place to harness that opportunity and we are firing on all cylinders. It's an enviable position, and we're ready to make the most of it to drive value for our customers and shareholders, as we head into the holiday season and 2025. Overall, this was a good quarter for PayPal. We are confident in our strategy and ability to execute going into the holiday season and 2025. Steve, let's go to Q&A. Steve Winoker : Open the line, I ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Sarah, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Hey, guys. Thanks and nice results on gross profit in the quarter. Look, unbranded decelerated as expected. It looks like you've been able to successfully meet that with strong pricing for value. So maybe, Alex, if you could just start by touching on the customer response to the pricing changes and what you're bringing to the table? And then just maybe perhaps touch on the deceleration, again, embedded in fourth quarter margin growth along with how we should think about the exit rate into '25. Jamie, that was helpful color, but any more just in terms of the dynamics and what gives you conviction in the sustainability to the underlying trends? Thanks, guys. Jamie Miller : Why don't I start with the second part of your question, Darrin. Good morning. And then Alex can talk about merchant response. So when we look at transaction margin dollars, as you mentioned, we're really excited about our momentum throughout 2024. And maybe I'll pause and just talk for a second about third quarter transaction margin and then talk about the comparative to fourth quarter. And what's important here is, we did have benefit from interest income in the third quarter. It was about 3 points. But more importantly, we have really good underlying growth drivers. Branded checkout TPV was up 6%, profitably growing transaction margin. It was our second quarter with Braintree contributing nicely to transaction margin dollars growth. So just continued progress there, which has been great. And then Venmo monetization, and Alex mentioned a couple of the data points on the call that, that's really starting to move along. And it's early days, but we're starting to see that become very consistent as it rolls through transaction margin dollars. So all of that consistent trends into fourth quarter. But what we've see in fourth quarter that is a little bit different is that, number one, interest income, it's been a benefit all year, that is going to be a meaningfully lower tailwind in fourth quarter. I'm planning on less than 1 point of contribution to transaction margin dollar growth in the fourth quarter. So really relatively immaterial. And then we're also planning for transaction loss normalization as well. We're launching new products, and we also have some lower fraud recoveries just on a comparative basis. So if I pull up for fourth quarter, we're really looking at low to mid-single digit transaction margin dollar growth for the fourth quarter. Quarter's off to a good start. But the most important holiday weeks are ahead of us, but the consumer feels strong at this point. And then if I pull to '25, I think the thing to think about is, when we look at '25, ex-interest income, we expect transaction margin dollars to grow at least as fast as 2024 on that same basis. Alex Chriss : Great. Thanks, Jamie. And Darrin, just to hit on the merchant response. I've personally been involved in a number of these conversations and I'd characterize them as very healthy and very strategic. As Jamie described in her remarks, a lot of this is, us really laying out our strategy to be focused on profitable revenue growth. And sometimes that comes with a relook at our contracts and a relook at the partnership, but I\u2019d say we're bringing more to the table now. And so the conversations we're having with these merchants is, we're innovating, we're bringing Fastlane, we're bringing ads platform. We're bringing additional value-added services that allow us to have a healthier, stronger conversation about where we're going. So it's not that all the merchants were excited to have the conversations, but they understand where we're coming from and we're bringing more to the table. And again, I feel like, as we\u2019ve talked about, we are really focused on building durable growth levers and making sure that we have these conversations with merchants and getting back into a healthy place is a big part of that conversation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi. Thanks so much. Appreciate all this -- all the data points here. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on the drivers of the more favorable view on transaction margin dollar growth here for the fourth quarter? And would love to hear what might improve and what you're most excited about going into 2025. And I recognize that it's hard to completely offset some of the interest income, but just curious what to be -- what we should be looking here for acceleration in '25? Thank you. Jamie Miller : Tien-Tsin, good morning. I really think it gets back to the key themes that we've been seeing all year. We've really focused on durable, profitable growth as we've set the teams up for this year. And part of that gets back to the product innovation and the deep investments we're making in our consumer experience and working with our merchants around branded checkout. The trends on branded have been very consistent throughout this year. And second, and this dovetails with what Alex was just talking about, the focus of the teams around how to really have our Braintree platform be more holistic, really looking at the holistic margin profile and really getting that to a place where we've got a much deeper breadth of value-added services with merchants. I mean, all of those things are things that again, have been growing this year, but the momentum we're seeing now and the visibility into how that continues is just, we just have more confidence and we're more constructive on that today than we were three months ago. And then, Venmo and even P2P, the PayPal peer-to-peer money transfer, those two products are really turning nicely for us. P2P has had a nice turn this year, and we're continuing to see good momentum. And then, when we look at Venmo, the actions of the team to really broaden how we bring this product to our consumers is really real and really rich. And you hear it in some of the data points Alex shared in his prepared remarks. But when you actually look at kind of the activity roll through, Venmo's just a very consistently sticky product for us. So really excited about that. And that's what I see as fourth quarter just continuation and then moving into '25 as well. Alex Chriss : Yeah. Just -- Tien-Tsin, just to reinforce what Jamie just talked about, what we talked about with contracts on Braintree, I think that's pretty clear. Venmo, you heard in my remarks, the core drivers that we have, we've now implemented from an innovation perspective. Our Pay with Venmo continued rollout. Our debit card is now embedded in the product. So I feel very good about the durable growth there. Maybe something we haven't connected the dots on well enough is, all of the innovation that we're doing with Fastlane and with PayPal Everywhere and with what I talked about in my remarks on branded checkout, it all comes back to that durable branded checkout growth, right? PayPal Everywhere, we're starting to see real habituation of people not just getting access to the offline checkout, but also now bringing that back into online. So all of this is driving back branded checkout growth. Same with Fastlane, where we're now starting to get more and more users that are just used to seeing the PayPal experience, and we can now market to them to bring them back. So as we move into 2025, I feel like, we are very focused on the core drivers that are important to the business, and we are innovating in the places that matter for our customers and will drive continued durable profitable transaction margin dollar growth into '25 and beyond. Jamie Miller : Yeah. And maybe, Tien-Tsin, I want to come back and just talk a little bit about interest rates because you mentioned that in your question. And I think, it's probably helpful to table set on that a little bit. So we've talked about transaction margin dollar growth at 8%. When you look at transaction margin dollar growth ex-interest income, which is really a metric we look at just as much as we do the main metric because we think it really represents what we're doing operationally in the business, that measure has been 4% year-to-date this year compared to negative the last couple of years. So when we look at that, really very excited about what we're seeing there. But when we level up and talk about rates, we've had that 3 point benefit this year, fourth quarter. I expect that benefit to be relatively immaterial. The rate cuts that are assumed in the forward curve, let's just pause for a minute on that, our portfolio is about a four month duration. So it just takes time, and it will take time for any particular rate cut to flow through. But the way to think about it when you\u2019re thinking about \u201825 is a 25 basis point rate cut is equivalent to about $40 million of transaction margin. And it depends on timing and when that happens. But if you just said, okay, we\u2019re going to take it down by 100 basis points to 150 basis points next year, it\u2019s about a 1 to 2 point drag on transaction margin dollar growth. So running the business ex-interest income is something we\u2019re going to be very, very focused on, as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question this morning. Now that you have a larger sample size of Fastlane acceptance in the marketplace, can you update us on the monetization strategy? Help us think through how potentially additive Fastlane take rates might be versus average unbranded volume yields? Alex Chriss : Yeah. Let me take the rollout of Fastlane and then, Jamie, if you want to pile on with anything. We are seeing great uptake in Fastlane. I mentioned over 1,000 merchants. We also, as you've seen are starting to bring on additional processors as part of that platform as well. And really, that is the focus of the innovation right now is improving the conversion rate in the 60% of non-consumption of a branded mark. So the majority of checkout is still guest checkout. We now have the best converting guest checkout product in the market. And so, our focus right now is adoption. Our focus is ensuring we get as many processors up and running. That's important, particularly, as we start to bring large enterprises into Fastlane as well because many of them are multiprocessor and will need potentially a Braintree and an Adyen Fastlane experience as well. And so right now, again, all of our focus on Fastlane is adoption. Pricing is built in to all of our contracts. We have relationships directly with the merchants. But our focus right now has been on adoption, and we'll continue to drive that up. Jamie Miller : Yeah. And with respect to economics and how this will flow through, we are in the midst of a lot of conversations with merchants. And all of that includes the pricing element. And we\u2019ve got good arrangements with our partners as well. Clearly, Fastlane will take time to ramp. And as we get through fourth quarter and through 2025, it will take time to ramp and see in the numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about branded TPV growth. I'm assuming you're expecting continued stability at around 6% in Q4. I'm just wondering, if the broader rollout of the new checkout experience will accelerate the branded growth in 2025? And just as part of that, I know you gave the metric that 5% of U.S. checkout traffic is on the new experience. Any sense of where that potentially goes over the next 12 months? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Jason. So to the first part of your question, yes, we see consistent trends when it comes to branded checkout. Again, our focus, and I've been consistent with this really for a year now is the improvement in our branded checkout experience. I've been very transparent that we had fallen behind on innovation, particularly on mobile. And as I sit here today, I am really proud and excited with the experiences we are now putting into market. And I shared some of the data on the improvement in one-time checkout with the 400 basis point improvement in conversion. Vaulted checkout, 100 basis point improvement in conversion. So we've also reduced latency in the overall experience by 45%. We've included additional mobile specific innovations like an app switch, which is driving 10% lift and success for -- versus just password, which is driving -- it's over 97% success rate on iOS now. So overall, we have rebuilt the entire pay sheet, the entire experience on mobile. I expect us to continue to improve on branded checkout. This is a core focus for the business, not only these experiences, but as I mentioned earlier, Fastlane and PayPal Everywhere, everything driving continued flywheel back into branded checkout. So all-in-all, we need to see this play out. In terms of the ramp, I mentioned we're 5% now. Look, the way I think about it is there are some integrations we have with merchants. Think about it as roughly a third or so, of our integrations, we are in -- we have some ability to continue to ramp up. We will do that throughout the holiday season and into early next year. And then some we need, as we've talked about before, many, many -- hundreds of different integration patterns that we need merchants to do the work on. And so the good news is, they now have an incentive to do it. The conversion improvements are significant. And the conversations with merchants now are very healthy, and they\u2019re excited about getting these new experiences ramped up once they get past the holidays. So we\u2019re not standing still. I expect continued momentum on that 5% throughout the next quarter and into 2025. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Amazing results again. I wanted to ask, if it wasn't addressed already. Are you able to give us like a sneak preview of how you see '25 because from our conversations, this remains a big debate? So I appreciate it. Thank you. Jamie Miller : Good morning, Dan. I think some of the comments that we've talked about already really helps shape '25 to a degree. You start with the revenue line. When we looked at some of the very deliberate and intentional conversations we've had with Braintree merchants, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing the impact of some of the revenue trades we're making begin to flow through the numbers in the third quarter. And that's also implicit in our fourth quarter guide as well. We expect that trend to continue through 2025 as we really shift from focusing on high portions of revenue to just more holistic, better margin contracts. Transaction margin, we've talked about a little bit that ex-interest income, really expect to see at least as favorable in 2024. One area we really haven't talked about is OpEx. And if I spend a minute on that, we do expect to see a higher proportion of OpEx in the fourth quarter than we've seen all year. And we're really reinvesting favorability back into the business. And in addition to that, we had deferred marketing expenses very deliberately from the first half into the second half. So you see that pop-up in the fourth quarter. We now expect the full year to be up low-single digits from an OpEx perspective. And when you look at 2025, that's probably the right framing and way to think about it as well. But just more balanced throughout the year in terms of how it flows through. Alex Chriss : Let me just -- I'd love to just share and unpack because you asked a little sneak peek about how we think about it and how we talk about it in the business. We are hyper focused on what we are in control of, and we are focused on building durable growth levers. It's why the focus of the innovations that we've talked about, whether it's branded checkout, everything coming back to that, whether it's the conversations in getting healthier Braintree economics, rolling out new innovations like Fastlane and PayPal Everywhere. All of these are things we're in all of its innovation that is important to our customers and that we can monetize over the long term. We also, from the metrics that we're focused on really are thinking about transaction margin dollar excluding interest income because that's the metric we can really think about and be in control of. And again, as Jamie said, if you think about the last two years, that was a negative amount for us. We've now turned that positive in 2024. I believe we now have built a solid foundation and baseline for us to grow on. And I expect 2025 to grow on top of that. So we, at least as strong and grow from where we set the baseline in '24. So the team is focused. Our innovations will continue to roll out into the market, and I think we're in a healthy place. Steve Winoker : And that\u2019s part of the good thing, Dan, also about the Investor Day that we announced, that Alex announced today in late February, where we\u2019ll have the chance to also dive more deeply into all those elements. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to hit on Braintree, two aspects there. One around competitive positioning on pricing now with the new sort of rebased pricing strategy. And then, also the ability to bundle and get prominent positioning with the button. So first on the pricing piece, really stated its (ph) -- with this new strategy, would you still consider Braintree to be more of a price leader, meaning when the contract is reset, is Braintree still the lowest price of all the merchant acquirers working with these various large enterprise merchants? And the second piece is, in the past, the button was often bundled as part of the contracts to receive prominent position on websites. Is that clause still able to be added into those contracts with this new pricing strategy? Alex Chriss : Yeah. It's a great question, Tim. Here's the way I think about it. We are not -- we are changing the conversation with our merchants. It is not just about a processing what I would consider, in some cases, to be just a commodity conversation about pricing. We are -- when we talk about price to value, we're talking about the full strategic conversation and what we bring to the table. And what -- so when I talk about the healthy conversations we're having, and again, I'm having many of these myself. When I talk to the CEO of a merchant, yes, they want great processing pricing. But what they're really focused on, how do they grow customers? How do they get more customers to buy their products? And those are now value services that we're able to bring to them, not just best-in-class processing, not just FX as a service, risk as a service, the ability to sell all around the world. But now we're bringing to them an ads platform. Now we're bringing to them the ability to start to target with payment APIs, the right customers at the right time. And these are really fun and really healthy conversations. And so, yeah, to be honest, yes, we will bundle branded because that's important to us. And it's important to them because it's still the best converting branded checkout option in the world. Yes. We will still have significant pricing that we will price to value, and we will continue to price all our value-added services. What's most important is, these are now bigger, more strategic conversations with merchants that actually help them drive the growth of their business, not just processing their payments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thanks very much. Really appreciate, Alex, your comments there on changing the conversation and being able to bring incremental value, including ad platform and driving that. I guess following up on Tim's question there, as you think about that, as you change that conversation, how should we be thinking about the potential then for pricing or value add and that kind of thing in the future? I know that you've -- I think you've done a really good job outlining that this is going to take time during the course of '25, but thinking about the long-term trajectory of where you would ultimately like to get and what you think that value looks like? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah. I think, again, it's very similar to what I just shared, which is, for us having these more strategic, deeper relationships that we can monetize across all of our value-added services is what's most important. And so again, whether it's processing, which, again, we should monetize or all the value-added services or the ad platform, Fastlane, all of these different pieces, we're going to continue to lean in. And we're going to continue to work with our partners to drive branded checkout as well, right? One of the things that's interesting as we have these strategic conversations is, how excited these merchants are about the demographics that we have as we start to reignite PayPal Everywhere, right? There's opportunities with merchants that are omnichannel merchants that are thinking about, hey, how can PayPal Everywhere now work in the store as well? As we start to bring Pay with Venmo. Pay with Venmo is an incredible opportunity for merchants as they now think about the ability to get access to one of the most valuable demographics of young, affluent spenders in the United States. And so again, all of these conversations just continue to build on themselves. And I think, we feel good about the conversations as well. Jamie? Jamie Miller : Yeah. Maybe I'd just add too, a little bit about where we are in the process. We have worked our way through some large renegotiations, which have been really good conversations. But we've got more progress as well in the next couple of years. The agreements are typically multiyear in nature. Some renewals happen earlier than others. But we expect that more visible impact on TPV and revenue over the next several quarters. But more importantly, we expect margin accretion to emerge over the next few years as well and part of that is these renegotiations. But equally, importantly, and you mentioned value-added services, it puts us in a position where in those discussions and following those discussions, the build-out OVAS and how we can bring that to bear in terms of building a much more sticky holistic relationship but one that really improves margin over time, that's a holistic piece of it that we're looking at. And we're already seeing that we have already launched in the third quarter of a really significant new value-added service that has been launched with a big merchant. And it's that kind of thing that we're -- we'll continue to grow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open. Harshita Rawat : Hi. Good morning. I want to follow-up on Fastlane. Good momentum with partnerships here. Alex, you talked about 100 merchants using Fastlane. What are you hearing from some of the larger merchants ahead of the holiday season and getting into the testing? And you mentioned using your existing ball to go to deliver Fastlane experience now. How should we kind of think about like the dynamics with branded checkout experiences here? Thank you. Alex Chriss : Hi, Harshita. Great question. So just to be clear, we're over 1,000 merchants now on Fastlane and continuing to ramp. A lot of those merchants are some of the smaller businesses, small and mid-sized businesses that are part of platforms that we were able to turn on like big commerce as an example. A lot of the large enterprises, as you can imagine, are in the middle of their holiday season. What we're hearing from them is very, very exciting feedback on ramping Fastlane as soon as they can. Oftentimes, that's going to start in Q1 to be transparent for a couple of reasons. One, a lot of their -- the code is shut down for the holiday season. Two, they want to make sure that Fastlane works across multiple processors and many of the large enterprises are using multiple processors, which is why our multiprocessor strategy for Fastlane is so important. And so, bringing on those partners, as you mentioned, processing partners is critical. But the conversations that I've had personally with a number of the large enterprises is, they're excited about Fastlane, they're ready to get on as soon as they can, and it's just about getting the work done. In terms of bringing that back to branded, we are starting to test into that as well. For us, again, if you think about the experience, we're getting the largest population of any accounts right now. These are people that have bypassed the branded experience or some of them have never been PayPal users, of which those folks that have never been PayPal users, 30% are opting in to Fastlane. So we\u2019re now vaulting their instrument, we\u2019re creating a profile for them, and we\u2019re able to bring them back into the branded experience. And so for us, that\u2019s going to be a big initiative as we go into 2025, building on those profiles, those users that continue to check out at high rates through the guest checkout experience, but sharing with them the value proposition that a PayPal branded experience has. And again, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen so much focus for us in \u201824 around building a rewards platform and starting to \u2013 even in the marketing that you\u2019ve seen us go out, really start to burn into the minds of our consumers that PayPal is the most rewarding experience and the most rewarding way to pay because we want people to be habituated into that branded checkout experience. And we think we now have unique levers, whether it\u2019s through PayPal Everywhere or through Fastlane to be able to bring them into that branded checkout. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open. Trevor Williams : Great. Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back to the transaction take rate. I think the year-over-year decline there was a little bit bigger this quarter despite a better mix between branded and Braintree. If you could just unpack that, how you're thinking about the trajectory of the take rate from here? And then within branded, the faster relative growth of large enterprise and marketplaces versus SMBs, that's been a consistent callout from you guys. Anything more specific on how that spread looked relative to the last few quarters would be helpful. Thanks. Jamie Miller : Hi. Good morning, Trevor. So take rate, as you know, there's a lot of factors that impact take rate, both our product mix, our geographic mix, custom mix -- customer mix, as well as pricing. And I would say, improvements in our Braintree margins are directly impacting take rate. And that's one of the things as we have lower incentives that we have improving margins, that's one of the more significant things you see impacting take rate just in terms of the overall mix shift in the numbers. And that is offset by we've also had large enterprise growth at a faster rate as compared to small and medium businesses. And that mix shift as well with large enterprises just having lower take rates than small and medium businesses, that also impacts just the math on that. And we've had some impact from FX in our payouts business as well. Alex Chriss : I'd love to just pile on small business. This is, as you all know, a very strong passion for me. What I feel great about is the innovation that we're rolling out. PayPal Complete Payments is now really the best one-stop shop for merchants to be able to do money in and access to capital. Money out, we still have opportunities as we think about the opportunity to allow small businesses to be able to send payments to others. But overall, FX, global, Fastlane, Venmo, all these different things that we can now package together for small businesses is exactly the right product. And the feedback we're getting, especially, as we lean into no-code, low-code solutions, easy onboarding, bringing developer days, I feel really good about the innovation we have with small business. Where I'm dissatisfied right now is, it just takes time, right? This is a long tail of small businesses. You've got a touch, what is ultimately millions of merchants over a period of time. So it's just not as fast of a switch as being able to just have a handful of large enterprise conversations. But we are building the go-to-market motions. I'm very confident in what the team is bringing up, and I expect that to continue to grow and us really to make penetration in the small business as we look into 2025 and beyond. Steve Winoker : Let's try to fit in two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about branded checkout, the 6% growth rate. Alex, how do you think that compares to the e-commerce market and how you guys are doing versus just thinking about the share? And then with Fastlane and improvements in branded and the focus on SMB, where do you think you can get branded checkout growth rates? Do you think you can get it to high-single digits or just some kind of goals that you guys have set for the company? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Yeah. What I'd say is, branded checkout has been very consistent. We are again, the largest, best converting and most share of branded checkout anywhere in the world, and it has been consistent. At the same time, we know there are opportunities. And the innovations that I talked about in my remarks and earlier in the call gives me confidence that we have opportunity to continue to improve that experience and grow. If you also then think about Fastlane, if you think about PayPal Everywhere, the habituation of people bringing back into the online branded experience, I think there's room for us to continue to take share there. So I'm excited about, first, you've got to have innovation. You've got to have a value proposition. I think we put those into market now and we've got the flywheel turning. So again, none of this is going to happen overnight, but I'm excited about where we go there. Steve Winoker : We\u2019ll take the last question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Schmidt : Hey, Alex. Hey, Jamie. Thanks for having me on here. I wanted to switch to the consumer side for a moment. Maybe talk about just the trajectory you see in monthly actives, especially given the, what you're seeing with the Venmo and the PayPal Everywhere promotion? And then just broadly speaking, maybe you could talk about just the pipeline just for products on the consumer side. It's just an area where we get a lot of questions in terms of the consumer fit? Thanks a lot, guys. Alex Chriss : Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. First, what I'd say is, innovation is the most durable competitive advantage we have. And what you've seen for us in the last few quarters is really starting to drive innovation, both on the consumer PayPal app, not just in branded checkout, but actually putting real innovation into the app with PayPal Everywhere launch, giving consumers the opportunity to now have an offline experience, which is driving habituation back into online, an enhanced rewards platform. And then on the Venmo side, leading in with innovations that, to be honest, customers have been asking for, for years with scheduled payments and groups and adding direct deposit. And so when I think about customer growth, customer growth is going to be essential for us as we continue to lean in and want to grow the business but that comes through continuing to innovate and continuing to provide great products to our customers. So what I'm really most satisfied about, when I look back over the last year is, we have an innovation machine that's now starting to ramp up inside of the company. Our velocity is improving, while we're reducing tech debt. Our ability for our engineers to put more releases out into our consumers' hands. And we have a very, very healthy road map of innovation that we'll be driving to our consumers. So very excited about where we lean in over the next quarters. Jamie Miller : Yeah. And I would just say, we've seen really steady progress in our monthly actives, both sequentially and year-over-year. And that is both the PayPal consumer and our Venmo consumers as well, also internationally. But one of the things we really haven't talked about, and I think Alex has teased in his remarks here is really PayPal Everywhere as well. And we're really excited about the launch we've had the last couple of months. We're seeing really strong adoption, really strong usage. We had more than 1 million new users since that launch. And the economics are nicely attractive on that. And it really drives habituation inflection. Just like Alex was talking about both with that core product and just the engagement with the app, the engagement with the debit card, all of those things, but also with respect to the halo effect that we see across other forms of branded spend with our products. So that's, I think, a great example of one that we're really excited about, and we'll have more of. Steve Winoker : I know we've gone over a little bit, but Alex, any final thoughts? Alex Chriss : Yeah. So thanks to you all, and thanks, Steve. So look, we\u2019ve set a solid foundation to build upon, and we\u2019re executing against our strategy. I\u2019m very proud of our team and the momentum we\u2019ve created for our consumers, merchants and partners. And I\u2019m excited to deliver a solid holiday season for our customers and continue the trajectory into 2025. So take care, everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to PayPal's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please Go ahead. Steve Winoker : Thanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's fourth quarter and full year of 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by CEO, Alex Chriss and CFO, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to you, Alex. Alex Chriss : Thanks, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal had a successful 2024, delivering strong operating and financial results. The improvements we've made to branded checkout, P2P and Venmo. Plus the progress we have made on our price to value strategy are beginning to show up in our results. We set out at the beginning of 2024 to make it a transition year. To narrow our focus and to make sure we are executing the initiatives that matter the most to the growth of our business. One year later, I'm proud that we've laid a strong foundation for durable growth. We drove branded checkout transaction margin dollar growth in each quarter. US branded checkout growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to exit the year at a high point as our new checkout innovations are scaling to customers. Driven by a renewed focus on pricing to value, Braintree has meaningfully contributed to our transaction margin dollar growth over the last three quarters. Venmo monetization is making great strides with over 20% growth in Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo monthly active accounts. Put simply, the PayPal team executed well during our transition year and made strong progress on our transformation. The investments we made throughout 2024 allowed us to perform well during the holiday shopping season and finished the year strongly. Total active accounts returned to growth in 2024, as we enhanced our value proposition and brought innovation to market. Total payment volume grew 10% to nearly $1.7 trillion. We delivered $32 billion in revenue up 7%. We reached an inflection point for transaction margin dollar growth, which increased 5% excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 21% year-over-year. We generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow and completed $6 billion in share buybacks. For 2025, we expect another solid year of transaction margin dollar growth and strong free cash flow, which Jamie will discuss. As we look ahead to 2025, I want to share the areas we're most focused on. First is innovation. With the leadership team in place and the velocity with which we're executing, we've proven we can bring innovations to market. In 2024, we rolled out new branded checkout experiences, launched PayPal Everywhere, introduced Fastlane, and expanded PayPal Complete Payments. We are not stopping there and will continue to innovate to solve our customers' biggest challenges. The second is product adoption. 2025 will be focused on scaling adoption of our innovations. We have world-class products and solutions, and we'll continue educating customers about all we have to offer. In 2024, we completely revamped our marketing and go-to-market playbook. We're just scratching the surface, so you can expect more ahead. Third is partnerships. Last year we formed significant partnerships to drive Fastlane adoption and bring more value to customers. We're building on our leadership position in payments and commerce and establishing ourselves as [the platform] (ph) that leading brands want to work with. We will strike even more partnerships throughout 2025. Fourth is efficiency and effectiveness. In 2024, we reduced headcount by 10%. We made deliberate investments in AI and automation, which are critical to our future. This year, we are prioritizing the use of AI to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency and effectiveness within PayPal. We expect to make meaningful progress on all four of these areas in 2025. Let me walk you through how this focus will drive our results this year and beyond. In 2025, our key strategic initiatives will be to win checkout, scale Omni, grow Venmo, and accelerate SMB. Our teams are organized around these priorities and tracking progress daily. Starting with Win Checkout, our #1 priority. With our upgraded experiences, we now have the leading checkout solution on desktop and mobile. When fully implemented, the upgraded experiences reduce latency by more than 40% and drive more than 100 basis points of conversion lift on average, consistent with the early results we've shared. These upgrades are now live for more than 25% of U.S. Checkout traffic, which is up from 5% last quarter. We have a lot of room to grow here as adoption increases in the U.S. and then expands globally. On top of the benefit of higher conversion, these new experiences improve the presentment of our branded marks and solutions like buy-now-pay-later, which can help to expand our share of wallet. BNPL customers spend 30% more on average and merchants see higher sales after adding BNPL messaging to their sites, which is critical when one more sale can make all the difference. In 2024, we drove approximately $33 billion in BNPL total payment volume, growing 21% from the prior year. Consumers and merchants trust the PayPal brand and experience. We have a lot more we can do with BNPL in the next year. Merchants continue to show strong interest in Fastlane. In the fourth quarter we focused on selling Fastlane to large brands that can drive future volume. I'm excited to share that we have signed NBCUniversal, Roku, and StockX and are working on implementation. We now have nearly 2,000 merchants up and running with Fastlane. We expect an inflection point in adoption when we expand our go-to-market efforts and bring Fastlane to even more merchants through Adyen, Global Payments, and Pfizer this year. From early data, what's exciting is that 25% of Fastlane users have never had a PayPal account before. And more than half have a PayPal account but haven't been active in the last 12 months. To say that simply, 75% of Fastlane consumers are new or dormant PayPal users. This means that Fastlane not only improves conversion for our merchants, but also introduces more shoppers to PayPal and enables us to reengage in active users. We've shared that one of our strategies is to build deeper relationships with our largest merchants as we renegotiate deals to reflect the value we provide. A key part of that is adding value-added services that improve the experience for our mutual customers. We built a suite of world-class value-added services and continue to introduce new ones. In the fourth quarter, we launched FX-as-a-service, which is automated currency conversion, and it's already live for Meta. We also actively scaled the use of network tokens for automated billing capabilities, which is live with merchants, including Instacart, Mint Mobile, and Poshmark. The expansion of our value-added services is a key driver of the transaction margin dollar growth we are delivering. Next let's talk about our initiative to expand beyond e-commerce to become truly omnichannel. We launched PayPal Everywhere in September which is driving significant increases in debit card adoption and opening new categories of spend. We added more than 1.5 million first-time PayPal debit card users in the fourth quarter, and debit card TPV was up nearly 100% in Q4. Our most active reward categories are gas, groceries, and restaurants. These new capabilities are driving deeper relationships with our users and more PayPal volume overall, offline and online. The average debit card actives generate 5 times the transaction activity and 2 times the average revenue per account compared to users who only use Branded Checkout. This is leading to habituation. Power users, which are PayPal consumer accounts transacting more than 100 times per year, grew more than 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing strong momentum today with our omnichannel push, but we are just getting started. We plan to expand our PayPal Everywhere value proposition to several European markets this year, including launching NFC capabilities in Germany. Moving to our progress to grow Venmo, our task is twofold. First, continue to improve the social P2P payment experience that made Venmo a verve, increasing engagement and bringing on more users. Second, drive adoption of our monetized products, including the Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo. In the fourth quarter, we continued improving the Venmo experience by giving our users more of the capabilities they've been asking for, like [scheduled send] (ph) and improved search. With these steady improvements to the experience, we see engagement increasing. Our engaged Venmo user base grew 4% in the quarter, reaching more than 64 million monthly active accounts. On monetization, we increased the average revenue per active Venmo account in 2024, and we plan to build on that growth in 2025. Monetized Venmo monthly active accounts beyond P2P and instant transfers grew more than 20% in the fourth quarter, driven by the adoption of Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo. Venmo debit card monthly actives grew more than 30% and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew more than 20%. We continue to expand Venmo's acceptance with major brands like Instacart and MoonPay, adding Venmo in the fourth quarter. And as we recently announced, JetBlue became the first airline to accept Venmo for flight bookings. So while we are still early in monetizing Venmo, we have a proven playbook that is resonating with customers. This gives us confidence as we move to 2025 and beyond. Finally, I'd like to cover our efforts to accelerate growth for SMBs. We are moving from a disparate set of payment products to building an end-to-end suite of solutions that solves more small business needs. PayPal Complete Payments was the first step towards an integrated suite of solutions, and we continue to make progress driving adoption with 45% of SMB processing and checkout volume now on this platform. Merchants on PPCP benefit from our upgraded branded checkout experiences. Key to our success in growing with small businesses on our platform is our expanding set of connected and value-added services, which move us beyond a payment provider to a growth partner and help us retain customers throughout their business life cycle. Take for example our merchant financing solutions. Entrepreneurs come to us for payment services, as they start their business. As their business grows, they need access to capital to buy inventory, invest in marketing, and higher. PayPal Working Capital is a financing solution purpose-built for early stage companies. As the business matures, PayPal Business Loan offers more traditional merchant financing to match the increasing complexity and multichannel nature of larger businesses. Our business financing solutions increase loyalty and engagement driving the PayPal flywheel. Merchants typically increase their PayPal volume by 36% after adopting PayPal Working Capital and 16% after taking a PayPal Business Loan. Our merchant lending originations were $3 billion in '24, demonstrating our leadership and that there is plenty of room to grow to support our customers. This is just one example of the services we offer that help SMBs change the trajectory of their businesses. Expanding this ecosystem of value-added services is a focus in 2025 and beyond. To close out, I want to thank the PayPal team for their focus on delivering for customers every day. I\u2019m proud of how far we have come in the last year. It was an important transition year for PayPal. We created strong momentum that sets up well for 2025 and beyond. We are now executing a game plan that we have confidence in, and I'm excited to share more at our Investor Day later this month. With that, over to Jamie. Jamie Miller : Thanks, Alex. Moving to Slide 7. PayPal delivered another solid quarter of results to end the year. While there is still more work to be done, the team is making progress, building on the firm foundation that we\u2019ve established. As we enter the second year of the company's transformation, our teams are energized and moving quickly. We remain focused on better serving our customers as we seek to drive durable, profitable growth. Looking at the high level financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 4% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. For the full year, revenue grew 7% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 7% in the fourth quarter or 6% excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Outperformance compared to our guidance was driven by higher contribution from branded checkout and Venmo, credit performance and interest earned on customer balances. For the full year, transaction margin dollars grew 7% or 5% excluding the benefit of interest and customer balances. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19 in the quarter, up 5%. We ended the full year with $4.65 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 21%. These full year results benefited from a return to transaction margin dollar growth, fueled by our transformation efforts, expense discipline, the higher interest rate environment and a strong capital return program. Turning to Slide 8. Our operating metrics reflect another quarter of steady progress. Total active accounts increased by nearly $3 million from the third quarter and nearly $9 million from last year to $434 million. Monthly active accounts also continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to $229 million with contributions from PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account excluding PSP processing grew 4%. Moving to Slide 9. Total payment volume grew 7% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $438 billion. For the full year, TPV grew to nearly $1.7 trillion, up 10% on a spot and currency neutral basis. Looking at the TPV breakdown by product, we see strengths starting to build in some key areas. PayPal P2P accelerated for the sixth consecutive quarter to 6% growth. Venmo also accelerated by 2 points to 10% growth. Steady incremental product improvements combined with reinvigorated marketing campaigns are starting to make an impact. Global branded checkout volumes increased 6% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. This was about a 50 basis point acceleration from the prior quarter. Underlying this growth, we were encouraged to see U.S. branded checkout volume improve in the fourth quarter. Part of this increase can be attributed to a healthy spending environment and specific vertical exposure. In the U.S., we\u2019re focused on scaling our modern, best-in-class experiences. From a merchant perspective, we continue to see the greatest strength across large enterprises, platforms and marketplaces. Winning checkout remains our most critical priority. Our goal is to drive more consumer engagement and a higher PayPal selection rate, which should accelerate TPV over time. Turning to PSP. As discussed throughout the past year, we moved rapidly within our Braintree business to prioritize healthy, profitable growth and intentionally let go of unprofitable volume. In-line with this strategy, PSP processing volume grew 2% in the fourth quarter compared to 11% in the third quarter. Our conversations with merchants have become more holistic, moving beyond price and share of card processing to a deeper appreciation of our customers' needs and how we can add value through our full suite of solutions. We expect a handful of large Braintree merchant renegotiations to result in a headwind to revenue growth of about 5 points in 2025. Shifting away from this volume pressures gross revenue but is accretive to transaction margin dollars and will result in more than 1 point benefit this year. We expect this benefit to build over time as we drive more value-added services. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to work through renegotiations at which point we should reach a new baseline to drive faster volume and revenue growth. Moving to more financial detail on Slide 10. Transaction revenue grew 4% on a spot basis to $7.6 billion, driven primarily by branded checkout and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter grew 5% to $778 million. This acceleration was driven largely by a return to growth in credit revenue. We continue to see solid performance across our credit portfolio. As Alex shared, we have begun to modestly grow merchant originations and expect credit to be a positive revenue and profit driver in 2025. Transaction take rate declined by 4 basis points to 1.73%, driven largely by mix. Venmo monetization was a slight benefit, offset by merchant mix within branded checkout and Braintree, faster growth in payouts and foreign exchange. Turning to transaction margin dollars. The largest contributors were branded checkout, Venmo, interest on customer balances, a return to growth in credit and Braintree. Transaction margin percent increased by more than 100 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our focus on price-to-value and profitable growth. As planned, we increased our level of strategic investment in the quarter, growing non-transaction operating expense by 10%. This growth included marketing spend deferred from the first half of the year and efforts to support the rollout of new products and initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin declined 34 basis points to 18%. PayPal generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing full year free cash flow to $6.8 billion. This is meaningfully ahead of the $5 billion we planned for at the start of the year and includes some benefit from lower cash taxes, which we expect to be a headwind in 2025. In the quarter, we completed $1.2 billion in share repurchases, bringing full-year share repurchases to $6 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $15.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $11.1 billion in debt. Moving to guidance on Slide 11 for the first quarter and full year 2025. For the first quarter, we expect flat to low single-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, which is heavily impacted by the Braintree renegotiation efforts I discussed earlier. This also includes about a 1 point headwind from lapping last year's leap day. We expect transaction margin dollars to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion, which represents 5% growth at the midpoint. We are planning for low single-digit non-transaction OpEx growth in the quarter, and we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to $1.17 or approximately 7% growth at the midpoint. Moving to the full year. We plan to continue guiding revenue one quarter at a time. We believe this approach has served the company well during our transformation, enabling healthy long-term decision-making that prioritizes driving faster transaction margin dollar growth. Over time, we are focused on accelerating both revenue and profitability. For the full year, we expect transaction margin dollars of approximately $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion, representing approximately 4.5% growth at the midpoint. In 2024, we had a two-point benefit from interest on customer balances. For 2025, our guidance includes about a $150 million or about a 1 point headwind due to interest rate cuts. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect transaction margin dollars to grow by at least 5% compared to 4.6% growth in 2024. In the first quarter, we expect minimal benefit from growth of interest on customer balances and then a headwind for the remainder of the year. One other factor to keep in mind is that in 2024, we saw a 1 point benefit from transaction loss improvements. We are planning for some normalization and transaction loss during 2025, as we roll out new products. Our focus in 2025 is to strike the right balance between investment and productivity, seeking to fund long-term investments largely through savings generated from better tech and automation deployment. We expect full year non-transaction operating expenses to increase in the low single-digit range. There will likely be some unevenness quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of initiatives, marketing spend and comparisons to the prior year. As a result, we expect second quarter OpEx growth to be higher than in other periods. We expect to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, representing about 8% growth at the midpoint. This includes negative impact from lower interest rates and just over a two-point increase in our expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Our guidance also includes approximately $6 billion in share buyback, and we expect full-year free cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion. I'd like to wrap up by thanking the PayPal team for their continued focus and dedication. The progress we made in 2024 gives us a strong foundation to build on, as we move into the second year of PayPal's transformation. One of our primary focuses this year will be driving adoption of recent innovation and scaling better customer experiences. It will take time for some of our efforts to build and drive financial impact, but we are confident in our road map and in our execution plans, and we're excited to share more with you at our Investor Day on February 25. With that, back to you, Alex. Alex Chriss : Thanks, Jamie. To summarize, in 2024, we executed the transition plan we laid out. We have positioned PayPal to compete and win and delivered strong results along the way. I'm very proud of our team and the impact they made during a year of intense change. The momentum we have created sets us up well for 2025, which is about scaling adoption. It is still early in our transformation, but our objective is clear. We are evolving PayPal from a payments company to a commerce platform that helps merchants win every sale and helps consumers shop smarter. Steve, let's go to Q&A. Steve Winoker : [Operator Instructions] Sarah, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Schmidt : Hi, Alex and Jamie, good to see the next stage of the transformation here. I wondered -- just digging on branded volume growth. Maybe you can just unpack the fourth quarter performance particularly in the U.S. How did it sort of trend relative to your expectation in terms of share of checkout? And then as we think about 2025, what are the right expectations to set for branded volume growth? And I know you mentioned a few things that are drivers there, your checkout integrations, reinvigorating the consumer side. Maybe just remind us what are the biggest unlocks in the time frame to see those come into play? Thanks so much. Alex Chriss : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me kick off and then hand it over to Jamie. So first, let me just remind us of the context of what we walked into at '24 on branded checkout. I talked about it throughout the course of the year as our #1 priority, and most of it was focused on how do we improve the customer experience. We felt good about the desktop experience, but clearly gaps in mobile. And that was innovation that the team really executed on throughout 2024, tested a number of different pay sheets, a number of different vaulted experiences. And then by the time we got to '24, felt really good about the innovation we were rolling out. And as we start to roll out, just as a reminder, our onetime checkout improvements is 400 basis points on conversion. Our vaulted improvement is 100 basis points on conversion. And so -- and the biggest impact is really on our mobile and our small business base. So really excited about the innovation that's now rolling out. As we talked about in Q3, we had just started to roll out. We'd ramp that to about 5% throughout Q4. We continue to execute on our rollout and got that up to 25% by the end of the year. So as we exit '24, I'm feeling really good about the quality of the innovation, our ability to roll it out and impact customers. And as we look to 2025, we now have I believe, the best-in-class experience on desktop, on mobile and starting to see knock-on effects of things like our Buy Now, Pay Later attach which is up 20% with this new pay sheet. So from an innovation perspective and a customer impact perspective, feeling really good as we go into '25. Jamie Miller : Yes. And Andrew, good morning. Just to add on there with respect to the U.S., we did see sequential improvement in branded checkout in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. And that was about three points of growth quarter-over-quarter really due to market dynamics, but also specific key vertical exposure around travel, crypto, gaming, et cetera. Alex mentioned we are still early in the ramp of our modern checkout experience, and that is certainly something that as we get into '25, we are very, very focused on. Our biggest priorities are really around innovation, driving those improvements in checkout experience. And you mentioned also giving consumers more reasons to choose. So some of the things we've done throughout the year around really improving the app experience, adding rewards, adding different elements to how people can find contacts and things like that, all of that is around engaging the consumer in a different way. And as we talk about internally, really getting the flywheel continuing to move between our consumers and our merchant experience. So from a 2025 guide perspective, we still expect branded checkout TPV to grow about mid-single digits and to have consistent growth from last year into this year with some acceleration with our initiatives, initiatives on top of that. Operator : The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal : Hi, thank you for taking my question this morning. As expected, unbranded volumes decelerated again as you pursue the price-to-value strategy. Can you give us your updated thoughts on your sort of confidence level, timing and toolkit to reaccelerate unbranded volume growth at the higher baseline profitability levels as we move forward here? Alex Chriss : Yes. Let me just touch on -- thanks for the question, Ramsey. And let me touch on just how we're -- how these conversations are evolving. So first, again this has been our strategy throughout the year. I'm encouraged to see just another quarter of branded/unbranded Braintree contribution to TM dollar growth. The conversations are continuing to be strategic in nature, which is exciting for us. We are having not just processing conversations, but now they are sort of evolving into two steps. One is the value-added services that we are bringing to market. I mentioned some of these FX-as-a-Service, Risk-as-a-Service, chargeback automation, orchestration all of these are things that we are now able to price to value and monetize, as part of a best-in-class unbranded offering. In addition, though, we are really starting to differentiate ourselves in these conversations by being able to bring customers to the conversation. And so again, as I sit down with CEOs of some of our largest customers and really talk about what are their greatest needs, it goes well beyond just processing. It really goes to how do we bring more customers to bear. And this is really the first time that we are leveraging the two-sided network that PayPal has and being able to say, hey we have hundreds of millions of consumers around the world. We now have an ads platform, we have reward platforms. We have the ability to enable our unbranded processing customers to create rewards and offers inside of our PayPal app to be able to drive additional growth for them. And so these become really fun conversations, to be honest, because we are now having holistic, not just processing but end-to-end, how do we leverage their marketing dollars, how do we leverage their ability to acquire customers in our two-sided network. Jamie Miller : Yes. And with respect to forward trends on this, we do expect similar dynamics in the next few quarters, some volatility. I mean, this is not something that just happens in a perfect line. And we still do have some large agreements over the next couple of years that we will work our way through. But the revenue growth should build as we lap some of the larger agreements fluffing-off over time. For 2025, we expect the renegotiations to be about a 5-point revenue growth headwind. But the other important point here is that it's a 1-point accretive on the TM dollars growth in 2025. So I think an important dynamic there that as you mentioned, we are very intentionally driving. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning guys. I just wanted to come back to the branded TPV topic. I think you mentioned U.S. accelerated 3 points in the quarter, if I caught that right. I guess that would imply international slowed. So perhaps you can quantify that and then maybe give us a sense of how that mid-single digit global branded volume outlook for '25 splits between U.S. and non-U.S. And just a little bit of color on how the transaction margin profile differs between U.S. and international branded. Thanks guys. Jamie Miller : Good morning Jason. With respect to international, we are still in a very strong market position there and we continue to take share internationally. We had less than a full point international pullback. Just some softness in Europe is what I would say. And when you look at the split, international to U.S., both in the TPV line and in the TM line, it is really 50-50. And from a margin perspective, it is slightly healthier outside the U.S. but it's very much in-line. Operator : The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang : Hi good morning. Thanks for the update. Just on grow Venmo. Can you just -- I know you'll talk a lot about it on February 25, but is it more about user growth, new products or ARPU from existing products expanding? Just curious what the algorithm is there. If you don't mind, a quick clarification. The step-up in CapEx in 2025, is that more of a one-time issue? Is it a sustainable level for you to consider? Thanks. Alex Chriss : Hi, Tien-Tsin, let me hit Venmo and then hand it over to Jamie. So on Venmo, and again, we will -- it will be exciting to see you all at Investor Day and we'll certainly dive deep on Venmo. But really, it is both customer growth as well as monetization growth. Again, we are excited. Venmo is the #1 P2P platform in the U.S. We saw MAAs continue to grow to $63 million by the end of this year. We are seeing TPV continue to grow up 10%, hitting double digits really for the first-time in I think, seven, eight quarters, up to $76 billion. So really exciting to see the continuation of growth and active users. In terms of our focus on monetization again, we've been consistent. This is about proven levers of debit card MAA growth, which was up 32%; and Pay with Venmo MAA growth, which was up 22%. The reason this is important is we've seen that debit card MAA delivers average revenue per account 4 times, when they adopt our debit card, and Pay with Venmo average revenue per account is up 3 times. And just as a reminder, we are in single-digit penetration across both of those products across the base. And so as we continue to grow customers, we are growing active customers and we are starting to grow penetration of monetizable elements. So this is exciting for us. We also will just continue to focus on innovation. I think we are just scratching the surface of a very engaged, highly valuable demographic. We've rolled-out new innovations like scheduled send and gifting and groups and direct deposits to bring more money into the ecosystem. But the team is a really, really exciting road map for '25, as we start to really think about what are the other needs -- once this money is in the ecosystem of Venmo. What are the other needs that our customers have to be able to enable them to be able to spend in an omnichannel way and obviously move money across each other. So exciting about what Venmo will have, and we've built a very good baseline of monetization throughout '24, which sets us up well for '25. Jamie Miller : Good. And then with respect to CapEx, we are seeing, over the next two years, an increase in the program to about $200 million to $300 million. And it relates to tech infra build-out and data center build-out in connection with both platform consolidation and a few other things. But after the two years, it should come down. Operator : The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller : Yeah. Thanks guys. Jamie, I think you said you would expect stable branded growth through '25, based on what you're -- what's built into your outlook. You guys have initiatives now where 25% of your checkout experience is on the more modern checkout, which I know has kind of ramped through the end of last year and were there now, and so it should impact, I think. The debit card is more further out. Marketing has been more substantial. I guess I'm just curious when those initiatives you think would have a more material impact. Or are they embedded in your outlook that they could have an impact on branded acceleration as the year progresses? Are you just building in uncertainty around things like international, maybe Germany or any other softness? And then just my one quick follow-on would be the exit rate of transaction margin growth ex flows, I think 6%, in the context of this 6% branded. So I'm just curious, when you think of your forecast, is there anything about this fourth quarter growth rate that was unsustainable other than maybe leap year? Otherwise, you're 5%, and I think you've added 5% plus, so it we may capture that. Thanks guys. Jamie Miller : Yes. So first, let us talk about the branded checkout growth in 2025. You were specifically asking about initiatives. And as Alex mentioned, we've got 25% of our U.S. TPV flowing through the most modern checkout experiences at this point. That is something that we expect to scale as we get into '25. And in addition, we are going global with that as well. So to your point, we do expect some impact from that to start to flow through. And we have embedded some of that in our guide, and we expect it to build over time. Having said that, we also think we've prudently planned here. And I wouldn't say, we've explicitly put an overlay for European softness in there. Having said that, we've left ourselves room for to navigate different things because as we roll this out, the impact of how this will flow through may be uneven as we see it. And then Darrin remind me of your second question? It was on TM, but I didn't pick up the exact question you were asking. Darrin Peller : Growth rate, you're at 6% already without any acceleration in the underlying KPI despite all the initiatives you've done. And you're guiding 5% plus -- I guess, 5% plus, right from a non-float impacted. So just making sure there is nothing unsustainable in Q4's exit rate that should inform you on '25's growth. Jamie Miller : Yes. When you look at '25 from a TM perspective, there is probably two things to think about that are headwinds to 2025 TM. The first is we expect transaction loss to normalize as we get into the year. We had a full point benefit of that in '24 and -- or a full basis point benefit. And when we get into 2025, we expect about 0.5 basis point headwind. And really, we are growing products that should carry with it a higher transaction loss rate. And then you mentioned the 6%. I would talk a little bit, even though around interest rates. When you look at total all-in TM, we are expecting about $150 million of interest rate headwind on all-in TM there, too. But when you look at the underlying profile of TM which really revolved around branded checkout, Braintree, Venmo, credit, I mean all of those things are things that we believe are durable it is clearly diverse and things that we fully expect to continue as we get into '25 and beyond. Alex Chriss : And Darrin, I just -- I want to pile on to Jamie's comments as well because I think it is really important to set our branded checkout strategy in context. First, as Jamie said, and I think we've been consistent throughout the year, we are excited about the innovations. I think we've been pretty prudent in the way that we have looked at a forward guide. We want to see the results before we tell you they're coming. But if I just step back and think about the strategy, think about what we did in '24, we really worked on innovation and what I would call just fixing the basics of branded checkout. As I described earlier, an improved product now in the hands of customers on both desktop and mobile, and we are now starting to see that scale as you mentioned, up to 25%. And we'll continue to scale that throughout the quarter and the rest of '25. We've expanded to check out to guest checkout, which we weren't playing in before. And now we are starting to bring in new users through our Fastlane product, which again needs to continue to scale and will scale over the next few years. But we now have innovation in market that is best-in-class to go after the guest checkout experience. We expanded to off-line. So now we are playing in an omnichannel world where it is not just branded, but we're seeing off-line commerce that we didn't see before. And it's driving habituation. Our debit card users are transacting twice as much as just a branded user and driving 20% higher average revenue per active. So we are just starting to put together a holistic strategy here that's beyond just a single button experience, but really starting to engage our growing customer base -- our growing monthly active customer base in a holistic way, where we really can be their commerce partner going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. So in the past, and when we talked about the mix within the branded checkout, we typically talked about it being very skewed to discretionary and to goods. And in prior periods of strong discretionary growth during 2020, 2021, the branded checkout button grew in-line if not faster, depending on the metric or the industry data that you are looking at. The growth was better than the industry. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how that mix might have evolved, if at all? And if we were to expect a better period of discretionary spend, should we see another period of the branded checkout button growing in line, if not faster, than the industry? Jamie Miller : Good morning Tim. So when you look at the composition of our verticals now, I would say that one of the things we've done a really nice job of in the last couple of years is really expanding to services. And when you look at some of the dynamics that you might have seen three years or four years ago, when you shift to now, we are just more balanced across different verticals. And I mentioned some of the growth in a few of the areas, but services in particular is one that has been a larger space. So I expect the dynamic to be more muted with respect to that discretionary side of it, on the good side of it. Operator : The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you good morning. Just a follow-up question on the U.S. branded volume. I think, Alex, you mentioned that it exited the quarter at the high point. I mean, is there any color on sort of what that growth rate was and how it trended into this new year quarter-to-date? Jamie Miller : Yes. So really, the way I think about branded U.S. is that we have been moving along, and we are obviously very focused on continuing to shift, continuing to impact our U.S. market position. And Alex talked about a lot of the innovation, specifically around mobile and around a couple of other areas that is really focused on driving shifting there. We saw some lapping in the first part of the year. But as we hit third quarter and into fourth quarter in particular, that was pure growth off a base. And that 3 points was reflective of that. Operator : The next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian : Thanks. And good morning. Maybe turning to the non-transaction expenses for the year. I was just hoping you could maybe expand on, first I guess, the ability to use AI for more operating efficiency. And are those initiatives that are requiring some incremental investment near-term? Or are you already seeing sort of a positive ROI from that? And relatedly, with the focus on scaling innovations and educating consumers, I guess what does that mean specifically in terms of the investments in customer acquisition and rewards that might be impacting margins -- operating margins through the year? Thank you. Alex Chriss : Yes. Thank you, Colin. Let me start with AI and then maybe hand it over to Jamie. AI is opening up a huge opportunity for us. First, at our scale, we saw 26 billion transactions on our platform last year. We have a massive data set that we are actively working and investing in to be able to drive our effectiveness and efficiency. Let me break it into a couple of different pieces. First, on the customer-facing side, we're leveraging AI to really become more efficient in our support cases and how we interact with our customers. We see tens of millions of support cases every year, and we've rolled out our PayPal Assistant, which is now really cutting down phone calls and active events that we have. We also are leveraging AI to personalize the commerce journey, and so working with our merchants to be able to understand and create this really magical experience for consumers. When they show up at checkout. It is not just a static button anymore. This really can become a dynamic, personalized button that starts to understand the profile of the consumer, the journey that they've been on perhaps across merchants and be able to enable a reward or a cashback offer in the moment or even a Buy Now, Pay Later offer in a dynamic experience. And so this is all AI-enabled and all things that will generate both efficiency for us from the consumer standpoint, but also drive more branded checkout and more sales for our merchants. In addition, we also are looking at our back office and ensuring that not just on the engineering and employee productivity side, but also in things like our risk decisions. We see billions and billions of risk decisions that often to be honest, we are very manual in the past. We are now leveraging AI to be able to understand globally what are the nature of these risk decisions and how do we automate these across both risk models, as well as even just ensuring that customers get the right response at the right time in an automated fashion. Jamie Miller : Yes. And then with respect to scaling consumer and non-transaction OpEx, we increased our marketing spend in 2024 by about $250 million, and we were very focused around really reinvigorating the brand and then really reinforcing the consumer value prop as we did it. And as we get into 2025, we will be increasing marketing slightly. Our total OpEx guide is up low single digits. I would say marketing is up low single digits plus in terms of how we look at it, heavily weighted towards the second quarter, as we really look at the profile throughout the year. But it is been very targeted. And we've seen the results of that starting to come true with consumer MAAs up sequentially. We saw debit card MAAs up sequentially. We are seeing P2P improvement. So there is been a nice kind of flow through of what we've seen. We've got some CAC, or customer acquisition cost, budgeted for this year but we really haven't started deploying that yet. We've been testing that. But the full suite will be things that we'll be looking to deploy as we get into 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open. Harshita Rawat : Hi, good morning. I want to follow-up on Fastlane. You talked about the new merchant wins. Now that the holiday season is over, and the merchants are more open to integrating new solutions, how are those conversations going with large merchants especially because there is also some competitive dynamics there? And then, Alex, you also talked about 75% of Fastlane consumers kind of being new or dormant PayPal users. Can you just remind us about how you are converting those into PayPal users? Thank you. Alex Chriss : Yes. Thanks, Harshita. So you are exactly right. So guest checkout, just as a reminder, for Fastlane, this is really six months in the market. So it is still brand new. There are other guest checkout experiences that have been in the market for -- some for many years, one almost up to a decade. And so we are the new entrant, but we are delivering the best converting experience for our merchants. And that's what gets us really excited. As we start to scale our Fastlane experience, we\u2019re still continuing to deliver double-digit lift in conversion for our merchants. And so our focus -- our go-to-market focus has been really on those enterprise merchants, on the largest ones. I mentioned a few on the call, NBCUniversal, Roku, StockX. And this has been obviously set up conversations throughout the holiday season as many of them weren't ready to actually do the integration. But now as we get into '25, it is full steam ahead. Now just as a reminder, as we have these conversations, they\u2019re very excited about the conversion uplift. Guest checkout is also not something that they've spent a lot of time playing around with. So it is not like these merchants have a scrum team sitting there ready to play around with guest checkout. So they're working on their road maps. So the conversations have been great. It is now about getting implementation done. And I do think this will take a number of quarters for us to really scale this out across the merchant base. But the conversations are exciting, merchants are on board, and I think we'll continue to see this scale. To your question on what we are seeing from a customer perspective, again, we -- 25% of Fastlane users that are coming in are new to PayPal. 50% were dormant in the last 12 months. And again, these are customers that are opting into Fastlane at 45% clip. So we are continuing to see customers choosing to, once they go into that guest checkout experience, actually opt into the Fastlane experience. To us, this is just scratching the surface of being able to now reinvigorate them. So we started to really ramp up our marketing efforts. It is still early, and it is through both off-line channels, things like e-mail, testing notifications, as well as online through the app to find incentives and reasons for these consumers to be able to reengage in the PayPal experience. The good news is \u2013 it is sort of a second bite at the apple, right? They have gone past the branded experience, they've gone through a guest checkout experience. We've accelerated it for them and for merchants. We've created that conversion. And now we can go and remind those consumers what a great experience a cash-back offer, a package tracking offer, a full end-to-end experience they could have gotten through a branded checkout. And we are going to continue to lean into that to reignite those users into being more consistent active users on PayPal. The last thing just that I'd say, as context is our PayPal users that are online don't use PayPal for every single one of their purchases. This is why the omnichannel habituation and just continuing to drive up not just our MAAs but those power users that I talked about that are really using us for all of their purchases, is so important to us. Because we still have users that love PayPal, have an active app, use us but still use us for just a fraction. And so our ability, even through the Fastlane experience to gather those users up and remind them of the benefits of actually going through the branded experience of PayPal, is so important and will ultimately drive to our branded checkout growth. Sarah, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open. Trevor Williams : Great. Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back to Venmo. Jamie, it sounded like next to branded, it was one of the biggest contributors to TM dollar growth in Q4. You guys have given some good stats on attach rate and user growth across the different buckets. But it would be helpful if we could get an updated transaction margin dollar number for Venmo. And then anything more just on the current mix of revenue across the different buckets, debit card, Pay with Venmo, Instant Transfer? And then just how you're thinking about Venmo's contribution to transaction margin dollar growth in '25. Thanks. Jamie Miller : Yes. So Venmo has been a growing contributor to transaction margin dollar growth. Certainly in '24, it was behind interest branded checkout, Braintree et cetera. As we get into 2025, it continues to grow in terms of its impact on TM which is really great to see. When you look at -- our Venmo TPV was up 10% in the fourth quarter. Our debit card TPV was up 40%. Pay with Venmo was up 50%. P2P was up 8%. So we are really excited about not only the core P2P continued strength but also just the beginnings of the investments we are making in debit and Pay with Venmo which, when we really dig into this, which is really our new Venmo leaders' target in 2025, we are excited about the growth we can drive. When we get to Investor Day at the end of February, we will unpack this with a lot more detail, and we are looking forward to talking to you all there. Steve Winoker : Alex, any final thoughts? Alex Chriss : No, just a huge thank you to all of you, and thanks, Steve. I look forward to seeing many of you later this month at our Investor Day on February 25, where we will share our vision for the future and dive into our strategies for medium and long-term growth and what it's going to take to get us there. So take care, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
