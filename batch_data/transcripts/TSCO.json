And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this afternoon regarding our first quarter 2014 results. With me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP, CFO; Steve Barbarick, EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, EVP of Store Operations. As we announced last week, Lee was promoted to Executive Vice President level and has assumed additional leadership responsibilities for the company's real estate team. I want to acknowledge Lee for his contributions, and I want to congratulate him on this well-earned promotion. Now we're very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter and how we are positioned moving toward the all-important second quarter's business. Our first quarter results again demonstrate the underlying strength of our core businesses, along with our ability to effectively manage through volatile weather conditions, in particular in the month of March. In fact, we experienced a significant number of store closure days and distribution center disruptions due to the weather conditions in the first quarter. Our focus continues to be on driving growth and operating income through a balanced approach of managing sales, margins, expenses and inventories. And we believe it is our responsibility to manage these factors effectively, not just for the quarter, but throughout the entire year. For Tractor Supply, the timing of sales for spring seasonal products is largely influenced by the arrival of spring-like temperatures throughout all regions of our business. This year, not unlike some years in the past, spring-like temperatures did not occur in many markets until the later weeks of March and into the month of April. Realizing this colder trend in temperature through the first quarter, we made a number of operational shifts to improve our selling position as we move forward into spring/summer. We delayed the flow of spring-related products and altered the shipment of specific seasonal categories such as live goods and outdoor power equipment. We adjusted inventory levels in line with sales and reevaluated our weeks of supply within our replenishment cadence in anticipation of a later selling season. In addition, we planned changes within our marketing program from first quarter into second quarter, allowing for the shift in sales for the Easter holiday timeframe. Our continued ability to read and react early to business conditions continue to improve as a company, and it positions us to optimize forward sales when temperatures do warm. Aside from our seasonal categories, the overall business performed very much in line with our expectations in the first quarter. Our comp store transaction count was again very strong, increasing 4.4%. We are clearly meeting the everyday needs of our customers and continuing to drive traffic to our stores. Despite some of the weather impacts affecting the spring season, we do not believe there are any material or fundamental changes in our customer trends, and our sales and earnings expectations for the first half and full year are unchanged. Although our internet sales are quite small at this point, we continue to make additional investments in our platform and saw solid progress in our e-commerce sales for the quarter. We now have over 20,000 items on our site, with many available for sale through vendor drop shipment. Cold weather-related categories, such as outerwear and heating products, sold very well in the quarter, and customers took full advantage of our drop ship capability after our stores began exiting these fall/winter categories for the spring transition. Our social presence online is also developing, and we are engaging with customers who want to share their Out Here experiences with us. Our mobile presence is growing, and more of our website traffic is coming to us through now a mobile device. We are confident that as we add more capabilities to our website and mobile platform, we can continue to grow our sales and believe that our customers are anxious to take advantage of the new futures as we make them available. In the quarter, we also made progress on our CRM or customer relationship management program, and we recently combined our web traffic insights with our traditional CRM data capture to form one view of the customer in our databases across all channels of our business. We believe, over time, this will improve our customer targeting efforts. And we also just completed a personalized communication test with our best customers based upon their purchase behavior. The test results were positive, and with these recent learnings, we now have the confidence that we can move forward toward development of a customer affinity program for 2015. Looking at the second quarter, we really remain optimistic and believe there are several positive factors that should benefit our business. The first is the high levels of ground moisture throughout much of the country, which historically has generated demand for lawn and garden products as temperatures warm. The second is the shift in the holiday season. 2013 pre-holiday sales were part of our first quarter, and this year, those sales moved into the second quarter. And third is the pent-up customer demand for spring seasonal products. While spring may be off to a late start in a number of regions across the U.S., our experience is that the business will come at some point, and we have readied our stores with appropriate levels of inventory to take advantage of the sales opportunities as temperatures warm in the Northeast and Midwest. Weather has always been a factor in our business, and that is why we recommend assessing our performance on a first half and second half basis. Now before I turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our Q1 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to acknowledge a recent milestone. We opened our store in Bullhead City, Arizona late in the quarter. This was our 1,300th store. As we expand our Western footprint, Bullhead City represented our 12th store in Arizona and our 57th Tractor Supply store in the Western region. We are proud of this accomplishment and our growth over the years, and I would like to personally thank each of our team members out there who passionately serve our customers and who drive our sales results. I will now turn the call over to Tony to review our financial performance for the quarter. Anthony F. Crudele: Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 29, 2014, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 9% to $1.18 billion and net income grew 10.9% to $48.8 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Overall, we are pleased with our bottom line performance for the quarter. While Q1 sales were negatively impacted by the late start to the spring selling season, we drove strong gross margins that provided us the ability to meet our internal plan. Comp store sales increased 2.2% in the first quarter, compared to an increase of 0.5% in last year's first quarter. Although it looked like we were up against an easy comparison, let me remind you that comps in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 were 11.5% and 10.7%, respectively, and benefited from an early start to the spring selling season in both years. This year, the winter selling season was very strong in January and February, as the cold weather drove solid sales performance and assisted us in the clearance of winter product. This contributed to mid-single digit comp gain through February. However, the snow and ice storms were very disruptive to the supply chain. As we headed into March, similar to last year, colder-than-average temperatures led to the late start in the spring selling season and resulted in softer sales than originally anticipated. Temperatures in the Northern markets were 5 degrees colder than last year on average and almost 9 degrees colder than historical averages. Although the second quarter has gotten off to a colder-than-anticipated start, we have seen our consumers respond as the weather has warmed to more typical spring conditions, and we are optimistic that this will result in a strong spring selling season. As we have often stated, we believe it is more appropriate to assess our performance by the halfs rather than the quarters. Comp transaction count increased for the 24th consecutive quarter, gaining 4.4% on top of a 2.2% increase last year. We continue to drive increased foot traffic by meeting the everyday needs of our customers. C.U.E. items performed well in several categories, such as feed and pet, as well as seasonal C.U.E. items including heating fuel, antifreeze and additives. Average comp ticket decreased by 2.1% versus last year's 1.7% decline. The decrease resulted primarily from deflation and a reduction in big-ticket sales related to softness in our storage category. Although we had a solid start to the riding lawnmower season and strong comps in the big-ticket winter items such as log splitters and heaters, it was not enough to offset the softness in the storage category. We estimate that overall, big-ticket sales reduced the average ticket comp by approximately 50 basis points and overall comps by 14 basis points. On a regional basis, comp sales were positive across all regions except the Northeast, which was the most impacted by the delayed spring. There were several factors that influenced sales in the quarter. We estimate that deflation negatively impacted comp sales by 80 basis points, which was at the higher end of our forecasted range. The deflation was driven principally by the feed categories. This compares to 140 basis points of inflation in Q1 last year, a swing of 220 basis points. Although deflation has a negative impact on top line sales, it has a favorable impact on margin rate, as I will discuss in a moment. Although the harsh winter had a favorable impact on sales and margin in the early part of the quarter, we were limited in inventory availability in some key replenishable categories, and we consciously did not replenish certain winter categories, such as heating and snow blowers, as we believe that the markdown exposure was greater than the sales benefit. However, we were nimble enough to restage many of our spring purchases as we experienced the delayed spring. We had 125 days of store closures due to the harsh winter storms, and we also had a significant increase in the number of store days with reduced hours. We experienced logistics and transportation disruptions related to the winter storms, including 12 closed days at our distribution center. As I mentioned previously, we were cycling strong sales last year in our storage category as a result of anticipated government regulation related to the Sandy Hook tragedy. We were negatively impacted by a later Easter, not only from the signaling of the spring season, but specifically as the Friday and Saturday of Easter weekend fell in our fiscal first quarter last year. Overall, the team did a great job delivering strong results despite these obstacles. Turning now to margin, which increased approximately 110 basis points to 33.5%. Our initial direct margin continues to improve as a result of our initiatives around price management, markdown management and strategic sourcing. Import purchases in the quarter increased 9.5% and represented 11.3% of the sales mix. Also, exclusive brand sales increased over 13.5% compared to last year's Q1 and were almost 33% of sales. Deflation was the most significant factor impacting margin. As we focus on maintaining margin dollars per unit, this typically will result in an improvement in gross margin rate in deflationary periods. This provided us the ability to drive a healthy increase in gross profit even though comparable sales were not as strong as previous quarters. The favorable colder weather in January and February provided strong sell-through of our seasonal winter products, resulting in fewer markdowns. These improvements in margin rate offset an unfavorable mix variance of approximately 12 basis points, resulting from increased sales in the heating and rider categories, which have lower-than-chain average margin, and an increase in freight as a percent of sales of approximately 17 basis points related to the mix of merchandise and increase in stem miles for our Western expansion. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.8% of sales, compared to 26.1% in the prior year's quarter. The deleverage in SG&A was caused by several factors, which include higher cold weather-related costs, including electric, gas, snow removal and building repair, increased distribution cost related to the disruption in the supply chain caused by the weather and the added capacity of the new Southeast distribution center, increased cost of our relocated data center, and as Greg mentioned, we continue to invest in our multichannel platform and tools. Also, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter, SG&A leverage benefited from cycling against a much larger incentive compensation expense in 2012, which made the year-over-year increase in SG&A last year much more favorable when compared to this year's increase in SG&A. Our effective income tax rate increased 37.6% in Q1, compared to 35% last year. Last year's first quarter benefited from the 2012 WOTC tax credit being reinstated. WOTC has not been reinstated this year. Additionally, we had a reversal of tax reserve pursuant to FIN 48 in last year's first quarter that had a favorable impact on the tax rate. Turning to the balance sheet. Although we had sizable purchases under our share repurchase program at the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $48 million and borrowings of $80 million, compared to a cash balance of $57 million and $105 million of debt last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.26 million shares for $84.5 million. Our share repurchase matrix drove aggressive share repurchases, and we were able to acquire the larger quantity than we anticipated. We estimate that the share repurchase program for the quarter did not have a material impact on EPS. Average inventory levels per store decreased 0.6% compared to last year as a result of deflation, the strong sell-through of our seasonal merchandise and the restaging of spring receipts to later in the season. The extended winter allowed us to effectively clear through cold winter merchandise, and we ended the season in great shape. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $41.9 million, as compared to $49.3 million last year. And we opened 32 stores in the first quarter, compared to 22 stores in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in capital expenditures related to cycling expenditures for the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year. Turning our attention to the full year outlook. With respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2014, as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. As a reminder, we still expect full year sales to range from $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to increase between 2.5% and 4%. We are targeting improvement of 20 to 30 basis points in EBIT margin compared to 2013, coming principally from gross margin as a result of several of our key merchandise initiatives and deflation. We expect SG&A percent to be generally flat. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $360 million to $370 million or $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. And we expect to open 102 to 106 new stores, with approximately 50% to 55% of these to open in the first half of the year. We still expect capital expenditures in 2014 to range between $240 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under the share repurchase program. Given the amount of shares acquired in the first quarter, for modeling purposes, we have adjusted our estimate of diluted shares outstanding to be 141 million for the full year. We continue to estimate deflation for the full year to range between flat to 1%. As grain prices have started to rebound, it is likely -- it is less likely that deflation will be at the higher end of the range. Also to reiterate, in terms of cadence, we expect gross margin percent improvement to be greater in the first half of the year, as we will benefit the most from the deflation impact. We believe that the third and fourth quarters will have the toughest comparisons as we cycle the very strong gross margin improvement and very favorable clearance conditions in the prior year. We expect the fourth quarter to possibly decline in gross margin rate based on our current projections. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Yes, Greg, would you comment a little bit, first of all, some of the changes that you've made as you went through the period and restaged some of those inventories. Can you give us any sense of, now that you've got another month under your belt, how has that restaging process for certain categories look going forward? Gregory A. Sandfort: John, I'll start, and I think I'll ask Steve to probably follow up with this one. When you start seeing the temperatures, which we focused on quite a bit, continue to stay cool, there are certain products that just aren't going to sell. And it's our belief that you don't need to push those products into the stores prematurely because they just start to age on the shelf. So I mentioned live goods, especially. You don't want to be bringing live goods in where there's risk of cold weather and frost. But things like some of the deeper depths and outdoor power equipment, other garden-related-type products and things of that nature are the things that we just had to restage. And the way we can operate with our logistics backhouse now and how that works is we can push the inventory much easier now to those regions where the business is opening up, for example, the Deep South and the West. And that's what we did. We just reallocated and pushed the inventories there, and we've kind of held off on some of those other inventories until the weather starts to warm. We're starting to see that now here in the upper part of the Southeast, and we'll follow that same cadence as we go into the rest of spring. Steve, do you want to comment? Steve K. Barbarick: The only thing I would add to that, John, is that a lot of the outside product that we have, especially for the North, we delayed some of those purchases. Those stores have product now. They're locked and loaded and ready to go. And again, it's the value of being somewhat of a nimble company and being able to react to what we're seeing out there in terms of weather conditions. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Great, and just to follow up. Tony, you put some of the comp sort of headwinds in some buckets. You mentioned 80 basis points for deflation. A little bit on the big ticket. Could you break that down maybe to include the closures in the calendar on that sort of decline? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, John, I didn't give specifics on those because it's very hard to sort of pull those out. Obviously, we have a lot of different factors to consider, such as what is the pent-up demand if a store is closed on the next day and how much of a supply chain disruption would have impacted those stores in being closed. So it's definitely a much smaller amount relative to those 2 that we stated specific numbers for. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So the weather was clearly disruptive in the first quarter. And it sounds like it's still been a bit of a drag in the second quarter to date. So what's giving you the confidence that the business will turn and -- such that you're maintaining your full year guidance and not making any adjustments to that at this point? Gregory A. Sandfort: Michael, it's Greg. Here's why we're confident. We've seen, as we say in here at the office, we've seen this movie before. We've been here before, seen how the seasons can develop like this, with a much cooler early spring, and business kind of pushes and shifts backward. Now the obvious question probably will be, well, will you be able to capture that business as it is coming later. And our belief is that we will. We have seen this in years past historically, and so we're not concerned at this point that the opportunity for forward sales is -- it's still there. So we feel pretty good about that. Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And is there a point at which you get into the season where sales are deferred totally until the following year? And what's the risk associated with that to your comp? Gregory A. Sandfort: There are always those points in time, but it's too early in the season to make that call. What we are confident with is what we're seeing right now in the markets where the weather has improved, where the weather is starting to break. There's another thing I should mention, too, is that the levels of moisture that are out in the market today, there's only a couple of places in the country, the severe Western part of Texas and some of the California area is where there's some drought. Other than that, the weather maps that we look at and we track, that moisture level is going to occur. It's there in some places already. And when the snowmelt occurs, that's going also be a nice plus for us, and that's going to continue this shift to that business a little bit longer. So I'd say that I'm not concerned. I mean, last year, the spring weather extended. I think we're going to see the same thing this year. Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. My follow-up question is on the deflation. Do you see any evidence when prices do come down that the consumers stock up, such that you could be seeing artificial benefit to your traffic associated with the deflation? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes, I would say that no, that would not the case. We sell -- our products -- customers are buying needed products. If you have animals, you have to feed them, you have to care for them. And Michael, the only time that I could say you may see someone do a little bit of front-loading, or we call it pantry filling, is when we may get very aggressive on price in a certain promotional window. And as you well know, we run only about 15, 16 rotations of promotion a year. So that is -- it's just not our -- it's just not our model. Anthony F. Crudele: No, one thing I would add to that, because I think there is value in this, is that there are some discretionary categories like bird feeding, that when the prices do come down, you get a lot more people that are interested in it. And if you look at our comp transaction growth, we continue to see a lot more footsteps in the door. And I think that there's value over that because we have seen it over time. It's not like this has been a short window of deflation. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : First question is on the seasonal products, I think, Greg, you mentioned that the riders were actually off to a decent start. So trying to square that with the late spring, I know you talked about the ground moisture. Was there regional strength in the riders or what do you think is going on there? Gregory A. Sandfort: You're absolutely correct, Peter. There is very strong regional strength in that category. And I think Steve and the team did a great job this year with the lineup of products. I think, in the store side, Lee would echo that comment. And that gives us some confidence, knowing that the moisture levels are what they are as we move further North, that you're going to need to have probably either that machine or you're going to be buying parts, some replacement parts for a machine you have. So we think the category is going to perform fine for the year. We will not, today, tell you that we think it's going to be anything more than it probably was maybe a year ago. It's too early, again, to make that call. But we're encouraged with the early business that we're seeing in the markets where we have the weather. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That's helpful. And then your new store productivity, it continues to be very strong and consistent despite some of the weather challenges, et cetera. But can you just talk about what you're seeing in the new markets now as you're opening and how kind of how you see the openings coming going forward? Lee J. Downing: Peter, this is Lee. The range of stores that we have, and we continue to have a mix across the country. So to distinguish between the West and the East is probably not really worthy of the time, but I will say that we continue to perform above our pro forma across the entire network, and we're very happy with those results. So I feel like that seasonally, a new store is not necessarily quite as impacted as some others just because of the new customer base that starts to come in. So we typically plan for that when we see -- when we put our new stores out there. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So I was just -- not to beat up the weather too much, but I was curious if you could talk about generically over the quarter how the feed and the food categories performed. Steve K. Barbarick: Chris, this is Steve Barbarick. You heard from Tony and Greg that January and February actually started off pretty strong. And a lot of that we gave back in March. So if you look at the C.U.E. categories, and Tony made reference to this in his opening comments, they continue to perform very well. We continue to believe we're picking up market share in a number of those categories. We continue to broaden our assortments, make sure we're priced right, and we are a dependable suppliers. So we feel very good about where we're positioned there. Anthony F. Crudele: And Chris, this is Tony, clearly, when you look at the numbers, the dropoff that we saw in March was related to the seasonal categories. And so as Steve alluded to, the C.U.E. items really were very strong throughout the entire quarter. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Understood. And then as you think about the deflation, maybe you can talk about how quickly that price tends to get passed or the inflation that you're starting to see in March, how quickly that gets passed through, how quickly maybe it turns? And is there actually a chance that perhaps as you get to 4Q, you could see some inflation reemerge in your ticket? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, as we've talked in the past, the inflation, deflation is most impactful on some of our higher-turning categories. Depending on how the product or the prices increase throughout the year, there is the potential that we could have some slight inflation in the fourth quarter. But currently, as we see it -- and again, our forecasting is based on this point in time, looking at today's prices compared to what we're cycling for the rest of the year, and that's how we'll generate our forecast. But right now, we see the prices increasing. It hasn't had that dramatic of an increase. We're still anticipating on a full year basis that we will be somewhere between the flat and 1% in deflation. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, perfect. And one -- just one last one. Could you actually maybe quantify the closures year-to-year or how you saw spring play out in the non-weather-affected markets in March, that would be great. Gregory A. Sandfort: Well, I would say that you've got -- it's a very small percentage of stores that were closed for any significant period of time. But the disruption of -- just for example, if you open a store at 8 in the morning, which is our typical opening time, and then the weather hits and the store has to close by 10 or 11 and we lose the sales for the remainder of that day and maybe possibly the next day, those are the kind of impacts that in the Upper Midwest and the Northeast we faced considerably in the month of March. Not so much -- we had some of it in February, but a lot of it in March with those storms coming through. And then on top of that, Chris, if you can imagine, the manufacturing base also experiencing issues, where they couldn't even -- could not ship the product from their locations either to our DCs or to our stores to replenish. So we had a bit of a moving target through that 6-week period there, dealing with a lot of that shift. But it was primarily the, we call them, regions, I think, 2, 4, and 5. It's, say, the part of Michigan across Pennsylvania up into the Northeast, which really -- and the latter part of the spring season is where we see a lot of our outdoor power equipment businesses and things of that nature and we will still see that business. So the disruption was short term. We've lived through it. We've worked our way through it. We're comfortable with our forward assortments. And I think we've got that opportunity to capture the sales yet. Anthony F. Crudele: Chris, it's Tony. Real quick, we estimate there was about 25 closed store days last year in the first quarter. So obviously, a significant larger number. And the one takeaway that I would have on the January, February timeframe is that the business could have been even stronger than it was if it wasn't for some of the store closures and the disruption in the supply chain. So we're really pleased with the way the business has performed in January and February. And again, with a cold March, we would expect sales to be a little bit softer. Operator : Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : If you could talk a little bit about the great start to the store openings. You had a pretty good run rate with 32 openings in the first quarter. What does that tell us about their ability to contribute to earnings as the year progresses. Do they ramp up that much faster? Anthony F. Crudele: Chuck, this is Tony. We definitely like to get off to a quick start. There are some significant benefits, but obviously, a full year of productivity with a new store will benefit the full year. Since we opened so many stores on a year-over-year basis, I don't think it will have a dramatic impact. But clearly, in our model, where service is a key driver and it continues to drive additional footsteps as we become more aware in a particular community, it clearly will help drive some incremental sales for the full year. Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : All right. And then returning to the near term, if -- could you tell us, Tony, what the delta in comps was between March and what you're seeing so far in April, without giving us the actual comp numbers for those periods? Anthony F. Crudele: Well, as we had alluded to in the prepared remarks, when we see the weather break, the customer clearly responds. And so as we have had warmer -- the warmer trends in some of the areas of the country, the consumer has responded actually very well. And that's what's giving us the indications that the weather pattern this year is relatively consistent with what we experienced last year. And as we went through last year, we saw the real expedition of sales in the May timeframe. So we feel that we're tracking very close to our expectations, given the weather pattern that we've experienced though March and into April. And I would tell you that it is trending positive relative to our March sales pattern. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : As you move into some of these new markets -- I guess this is a follow-up kind of similar to, I believe it was Peter's question -- as you move kind of West, what kind of return -- how does the return profile of some of these stores change? And specifically regarding kind of labor and occupancy, does that actually ease or is it dependent on what kind of market you're heading into or is California actually more expensive? Can you just give us some general clarification on that? Anthony F. Crudele: Sure, Scot. This is Tony. As we talked about in the past, our model, when we approve a store, were driven based off of a 10-year discounted forecast -- discounted model. And we set a hurdle rate. So when we look at a particular store, as much as you like to have that higher-volume store, the key is going to be the bottom line results and how much cash it throws off over that period of time. So as we move out in California, generally, you're going to have much stronger sales base. And obviously, the rents are going to be much, much higher. What we see, and the only difference between a store in the Southeast and a store in California or the Southwest, is the various ramps. So as we have a significant ramp in a store with, say, $100,000 of rent, you can really start to drop that to -- the profit, to the bottom line. In California, again, you start with a higher base, and if you have that acceleration, again, you can really start to leverage those fixed expenses. So the model will work very consistently throughout. Payroll is a little bit higher out West, as well as the supply chain. And obviously, we'll start to cure that as we develop a Southwest distribution center over the next 1.5 years. So when we look at it across the board, again, it really is centered on making sure that we meet their hurdle rate when we approve a store. After that point in time, on an aggregate basis, the stores will perform fairly consistently. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Tony, because you don't have as much store density out there, does the maturity curve look much different than what you would see on the, let's call it, the East Coast? Anthony F. Crudele: No, it actually -- right now, just based on the stores that we've had out there -- and we've had California stores actually since 2004. I would tell you that they perform consistently with those on the East Coast. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Greg, you mentioned that due to the weather, you made some shifts in the marketing expenditures, pushing some programs from 1Q to 2Q. If you hit your revenue goals in Q2, whatever that may be, what is the anticipated effect on the marketing spend in Q2? Gregory A. Sandfort: Well, as a percent of sales, it will probably come down, I think, now that we've seen what's happening. But remember, we made a conscious decision to make that shift due to the movement of Easter. And we also anticipated that we could have a bit of an extended spring, which is exactly what we are now seeing. So as a percent of sales, it will probably be a little less than what we initially planned. But for the half, it will be relatively the same, probably be on plan. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I may, with respect to the DC. So if you do the math, the store closures represent a pretty small fraction of the total store days in the quarter, maybe 0.1%. I was wondering, the 12 days that the DC was closed, what was the -- how many stores did that affect? And as a follow-up to that, for how long do you anticipate deleverage coming from the new Southeast DC? Gregory A. Sandfort: Okay, let's take it in 2 steps. The DC closures, you have to put it in perspective to -- into 2 buckets here. One is closure of the DC due to weather and our inability to operate because the team members can't get there, and secondly, the inability of the manufacturers to move product by truck, which typically how it comes to us to the DC. So we've got 2 variables working here. It's hard to say how many absolute stores. I can tell you that probably 3 of our regions were most affected, some in the Southwest, some in the Northeast. Primarily, though, the 2 areas, it's kind of where that swath of weather kept coming through. It would come from the Southwest and sweep up through the Northeast, hit a little bit in the Midwest. So it really hit 3 of our buildings. So if I look at that, they've got to serve somewhere probably around 450 stores, in that range. Now it didn't affect every store every day, depending upon the days that these storms came through and the disruptions. But it was quite disruptive, I will say that. As far as the deleveraging on that Southeast DC, we're going to cycle through that here as we get through the summer period, to get through the June, July, when we opened that building a year ago. So that's -- they're going to be behind this year shortly. Operator : Our next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just want to follow up on what you were saying about restaging your spring seasonal products. Was this actually disruptive to your store operations? What kind of lead time do you need to give your vendors? And can you give us a sense of those one-off weather-related costs in terms of utilities and snow removal in SG&A? Lee J. Downing: Denise, I'll take it first. This is Lee. As far as store operations goes, when you start restaging product, it really doesn't hurt a whole lot, because in the Northeast or in the Northern areas where there's still snow on the ground, a lot of that product is outside. So I mean, it actually helps us to restage, so we don't have to try to do work in the snow. So I think it's really actually helpful when we restage the product. So it probably makes us much more productive in stores. I'll let Steve answer the rest of that. Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, in terms of working with our supplier community, we have weekly calls with our key suppliers when we go into spring. They see this, not only with Tractor Supply, but with a lot of their other customers. Because of our purchasing power, we're typically prioritized, and we haven't seen any real hiccups or supply chain issues relative to those goods that we've delayed. Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And is there anything you can say about the additional costs from snow removal and utilities? Lee J. Downing: I would tell you that it actually was a significant increase over last year. And it really -- when you look at the various numbers, the occupancy -- increase in occupancy, because of those line items, was the most significant one as far as the deleveraging that we experienced in the first quarter. Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. Just one follow-up here. What categories do you think that you're taking market share in? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, we typically talk about the C.U.E. business in general. And we've always talked a little bit about the fact that when it comes to livestock feed and some of the other categories, we go into a community, and there is a lot of people who carry what we have, but we offer a different experience. We put it all under one roof. We're open typically more hours and more days, and our customers tend to gravitate to us that way. So we think there's a variety of categories where we continue to win, and we will continue to make sure that our assortments are right, that we're priced right and that we're a dependable supplier. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : First question is on gross margins. You talked about deflation being the largest driver of gross margin improvement year-over-year. Can you help rank order the other drivers you mentioned, which 1 or 2 were most important? Anthony F. Crudele: Sure. This is Tony. When we look at it -- and again, when we analyze gross margin and the improvements, there is a lot of overlap. So if I were to break it down, we -- because of the -- deflation was obviously the largest. Then when we look at imports, I would probably categorize as next. Depending on how you break out the price optimization piece, because again, there is a portion in which we manage deflation through the price optimization. I would probably say that falls in -- as your second category and -- or second or third category. And then the way we manage the clearance throughout the quarter. And again, some of that is the improved management and the tools that we're using, as well as the weather giving us the ability to be able to clear with less markdowns. So it's difficult to rank them, and I think that once you get past the deflation, those categories for the most part are all in about the same ballpark. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Got it. That's helpful. As we think about the go forward through the balance of the year, is it appropriate to think about the same type of magnitude of benefit to gross margins from those drivers outside of deflation? Anthony F. Crudele: Generally, when it comes to our initiatives around price optimization, strategic sourcing, they have been fairly consistent. My one hesitation on that question is around the markdowns, because obviously, a lot of it has to do with how much inventory we're buying, how the season ends and then obviously, then the tools that we have around that to try to maximize the clearance. So I would look at a couple of those as being very consistent. But when it comes to the markdown management, that is going to vary from quarter to quarter. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Great. And one last follow-up. Could you quantify for us the Easter shift? How much benefit is expected to shift from Q1 to Q2 because of the timing of Easter? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, when it comes to that, we had obviously 2 days last year, and it obviously was the sort of the buildup to Easter. We are closed on Easter Sunday. So we actually lose that comp day, which does match up between the quarters. So there is no change in comp days through the quarter. So you're really looking at just a fairly limited impact when it comes to that subsequent Monday because there is a pent-up demand, since we're closed on Sunday, and those 2 days before. So net-net, between the 2 quarters, you're probably looking at around low double digit, you know, maybe 10 basis points. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Two questions for you. First of all, as you think about the shift in your business associated with the weather, the delayed spring, and you think about how that plays out respectively for traffic, ticket and gross margin, versus what an ordinary spring would look like, how would you think about those moving pieces? Gregory A. Sandfort: Matt, this is Greg. I believe that when you have the temperatures to sell spring/summer product, the traffic count typically from -- and what we've seen historically is there. It can be fairly violent, meaning that it can come quick, fast and furious, in a matter of 10 days to 2 weeks to maybe stretching to 3 weeks, depending upon how late that temperature impact occurs. We're expecting some of that, honestly, in the Northeast, where there's still snow on the ground. And it's going to be probably mid- to late-May scenario, but the big impact of what I look at when I look at ticket and looking at is traffic, traffic count. And the fact that our footsteps were up in that first quarter, and we continue to see strength in that footstep. When this weather does open up, and it will, we do not anticipate that, that's going to slow at all. As a matter of fact, it should accelerate. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And in terms of the average transaction size associated with that traffic, given the mix that you anticipate to see and also what that mix would mean for gross margin, obviously, the mix benefited grosses a bit in Q1, does it go the other way in Q2 or not necessarily? Gregory A. Sandfort: It could move back a little bit with the sale of a lot of big-ticket product. That is true. We know that. We manage to that. But I would tell you that the average ticket will also move up. So we'll start to see a little bit more leverage and SG&A cost. So it's kind of there's good guys and bad guys in that mix. But we anticipate that. We plan for that now, and we've recalibrated for that. So I feel, I'm fairly confident that it could be a little later, but it will still come. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then the quick follow-up. You had discussed at various times some discreet investment spending for 2014. I think you'd quantified that. Is there any way to quantify the degree to which that impacted Q1 and whether the cadence of the impact is on plan with your original thought process? Anthony F. Crudele: Matt, Tony. Our capital spending is very consistent with what we had anticipated going in. And we continue to make investments in several different areas, in particular e-commerce. And then as we move forward through the second half of the year, we'll be making investments in our clearance optimization, as well as in demand planning. So those are 3 of the big ones, as well as, I guess, a fourth would be the CRM that Greg talked about as well in his prepared remarks. So when we look at the first quarter, one of the variables that occurred is, if you remember, back at the end of 2012, we had taken a charge relative to our e-commerce platform. And so as we cycled through into Q1 this year, and we had made some investments last year in our new platform, we started to see that come through to Q1, obviously, in the form of depreciation, whereas we had very minimal last year. So from an impact on the quarter, there was definitely $1 million to $1.5 million of what I would term additional investment that was charged in this quarter versus what we saw last year in the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: Somebody broached the topic of outdoor space earlier, so I wanted to just dig into that again, which I do often. But by my calculations, your sales per square foot in the outdoor area are about 15% of the sales per square foot of your inside area. Home Depot and Lowe's, by my calculations, do like 40% to 50% outdoor to indoor. I'm just wondering where that fits on your priority list and if you can help us just dimensionalize the opportunity there, and if you have enclosed any of those areas to kind of get more business out of them, what kind of results you see from those types of stores. Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, absolutely. This is Steve again. We do see opportunity with the outside of our stores, and we continue to test and try new things. Last year, we got more into live goods, bag mulches and soils that are outside. We've got a number of stores right now that we're testing an ability where customers can go directly into the yard without going through the door first. And we'll see how that pans out for us as we get through the spring season here, because it's a relatively new change that we made. We have also got forage product, which we didn't have a few years ago, that's outside. And we have got some other new things that we're testing out there as well in terms of product. So we recognize that this could be a potential opportunity for us. We've just got to figure out how we get customers in there, comfortable in that area, open those doors. And while we don't have an awning today, we believe there's more potential as well. We will continue to test and try, I can promise you that. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: And then if it's okay, on the segmentation, it was mentioned at the top of the call as well. I know you've kind of been prioritizing that recently and probably are learning something from it every week. Can you kind of just help us figure out what types of surprises you're learning as you segment your customers, what you are seeing and maybe what actions you've been taking and what results or response you see from kind of that CRM implementation? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, this is Steve again. There's always a lot of learning with the evolution of a retail store and chain. And I would tell you that over time, and I've been with the organization -- this is my 17th year. We've seen a change and a modification in our customers and their behavior. We talked a little bit about our lifestyle customer. They tend to live closer to our stores. They tend to buy more convenience-type products. There's a reason we've had multiple quarters of comp transaction growth, and we believe a lot of that is bringing in new customers because of the products that we're carrying in our stores and how we're marketing them. So we've talked about gardening products. We've talked a little bit about pet products. And there's other categories that are at our store that are more broad-based, and we're getting the word out on those categories, bringing in new products and expanding our lines, without necessarily disenfranchising our core customer, because I think you can do both at the same time. Recently, Greg mentioned that we did a test on one of the segments that we have. It was a personalized test with touch points in digital, e-mail, along with direct mail. And of the groups that we talked to within the segment, we saw positive ROI with each one in their shopping behavior back to us. And that gives us confidence, that as we move forward with an affinity program in '15, that it's going to work and pay dividends for us in the future. We've also made a strategic hire, a Director of Customer Marketing, a position we didn't have before. And we believe that, that will add tremendous value for us in the future as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Jonathan N. Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : This is Jon Berg on for Peter tonight. We're just curious in looking at how a tough winter may or may not drive stronger lawn and garden sales. And I know it's probably difficult at this point to tell whether or not it's improving demand in the Northern parts of the country, but maybe in a state like Georgia, that saw greater snow and ice this year, have you seen a stronger-than-expected pickup in sales in that category? Gregory A. Sandfort: Jon, I would tell you -- this is Greg. I would say to you that again, we don't talk in specific state, but I can say that in the Deep South and in the South, where temps have warmed and they were much cooler earlier and kind of somewhat suppressed customer demand, the business is opening up. And we're very encouraged with what we're seeing. As Steve said earlier, the number of new programs that are out there in the stores that are really temperature sensitive. And I think anyone that's in some of these businesses will tell you the same. So comfortable, confident that we've got a good trend going there, and we believe that trend will just continue to move north as temperatures warm. Jonathan N. Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. As my follow-up, Tony, is there any way you could provide any color or quantification maybe around what markdowns did for your gross margin in the quarter? Anthony F. Crudele: We don't provide that information, again, because as we work through technically what is clearance and what the impact is on sort of price optimization or what the impact price optimization had on the clearance -- some of the mix changes, I don't think it would benefit to try to quantify specifically. Net-net, you're going to be somewhere in the -- again, just the low double-digit territory. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I was hoping you could just walk us through sort of what the trends were like last year in the second quarter? I believe that, as you said, April did start a little bit weak again. And then sort of how it ramped. And then maybe if there is any sort of just geographic differences this year versus last year. And then on the cost side, just remind us what you guys are expecting for the DC -- the headquarters relocation and some of the other projects you have planned for the back half of the year. Anthony F. Crudele: All right, Adam, this is Tony. Just to give you the background, when we went into Q2 last year, obviously, April was the softest month and the significant spike occurred in May. And then a strong June, but not in the same ballpark as the strength of May, but still a very strong performance in June. As we move into this quarter, as we've said before, it appears as if we're running the same pattern. And so that's what we're looking at and anticipating as we move into Q2. The one big advantage we had last year, and again, we're very hopeful that trend will continue, is it was not only a delayed spring but an extended spring and it even moved into Q3. And we had a very strong July and August. So that will be a key. And again, one of the main drivers is the moisture that's in the ground. Obviously, rainfall that occurs through the second quarter will be beneficial as well to drive that spring into Q3. Gregory A. Sandfort: Adam, this is Greg. On some of the initiatives and some of the capital outlays, Tony mentioned about demand planning for the latter part of this year. I mentioned earlier in my comments about some of the work we did in CRM early in the quarter. And now we'll be working towards '15 for some of that implementation. The headquarters building, our Store Support Center, will be completed and will begin occupancy with our first move, sometime probably in July or early August, hopefully, to have everyone under one roof by the end of the year. But again, that all depends upon how smooth the first move takes place. But right now, I think everything that we're working through and working on from a spend standpoint is coming -- falling within the plan. We've got some things we're doing in the distribution network as well. So I think we're in good shape. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : Two questions. You talked about the loyalty card and you talked about online. Just curious if you could frame what success looks like in terms of those initiatives, in terms of the payback that we might see in results? Gregory A. Sandfort: Eric, you said loyalty and -- we missed the... Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : Loyalty. Loyalty and online. Gregory A. Sandfort: Okay, online, okay. Steve, do you want to talk about... Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, I'll talk to the loyalty program. We call it an affinity program here. Again, this is about capturing data from our customer, bringing them to an opt-in position with us and then communicating with them over the course of time, the way they want to be communicated to, that's relevant to their lifestyle and their needs. We haven't put a dollar amount to it at this juncture. We're still in the process of the RFP and trying to understand all the dynamics of that. But at the end of the day, we want to get to know our customer better, and whether that be the content that they want to see online, how they want to be talked to and what kind of -- what they're looking for from Tractor Supply Company. We believe we've got a customer base out there that wants to be more engaged with us, and this will open the opportunity for us to do so. Anthony F. Crudele: Eric, this is Tony. Just to tag on to what Steve said. We have been very deliberate in our approach to the loyalty program. And it all centers around designing something that the customer wants and isn't necessarily something that would degregate [ph] margin. So when we look at that and design that, we want to be very careful, because we understand that we're a destination store. And it's not as critical to try to entice people to come into our -- into the store. So the design is going to be very critical for it to be successful, so that we can capture information about our customer and be able to correspond with them. Gregory A. Sandfort: Eric, this is Greg. I'll talk about the online for a moment. We mentioned in our prepared remarks about drop shipment, and what we saw was the consumer still having a need for certain fall/winter products that we were already starting to exit in the 4-wall store, but they took full advantage of because they were available through the drop ship program with certain vendors online. That was a bit of a surprise but a great learning for us. It helps us extend some of the seasons with no risk. The mobile business, we don't have -- we have a mobile site that is capable now. But we're seeing people come through the mobile, some type of mobile platform, into our website and exchange, not only information with us, looking to exchange commerce. So we've got some interesting things happening. It's still very early for us. There's still lots of learning. But we're excited about what we're seeing. Operator : And our last question will be from Gary Balter from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : One question is just a follow-up. On the gross margin, obviously, you talked about spring seasonal getting delayed. If we think about the gross margin on the different merchandise, is that a higher-margin category, putting aside the deflation impact, et cetera, than C.U.E., some of the things that you did sell through in Q1? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, Gary, Tony. The spring assortment and seasonal categories will generally be a higher margin and will be beneficial. My only caveat would be strong riding lawnmower season, which tends to be well below chain average. But we obviously love to get that customer in because then we turn them into hopefully a customer for life, and we can service their repairs and their other needs relative to that. So we anticipate right now a reasonable season that generally will correspond from a margin standpoint to the prior year. Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then just to follow up, Greg, maybe I go back too far with this company, but in the past, years ago, you used to talk about resetting the right side of the store and then the left side of the store. And obviously, it's been extremely successful. If you look at the inside of the store, are there areas that you still feel are underperforming, that are a focus of resetting or remerchandising? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, this is Steve, I will tell you that this is a culture of being relentlessly dissatisfied. I can tell you, we're probably not happy with the majority of the inside of our store, and we think we've got upside just about everywhere. So the merchant team, working with our space planning team, is looking at every square inch, every peg, every 4-way and every shelf to optimize the opportunity. So I would tell you, yes, we're still working on it. Operator : That conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort: Okay, thank you, everyone. In closing, I'd like to thank all of you who are invested in Tractor Supply and all of our team members out there living the lifestyle, serving our customers and driving our company's performance. We believe 24 consecutive quarters of comp transaction count growth, and 18 consecutive quarters of positive comparable store sales is evidence that customers are increasingly looking to Tractor Supply as a one-stop shop for rural lifestyle needs, and we continue to strive to be the most dependable supplier of those needs. Thank you for spending time with us today, and we look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you during our next call in late July. Operator : That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

I am now pleased to introduce Greg Sandfort, Tractor Supply Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Greg, please go ahead. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. With me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and CFO; Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate; and Steve Barbarick, EVP of Merchandising and Marketing is out of town today attending a trade show so he will not be with us. Now although the second quarter did not fully live up to our expectations I am pleased with how our team reacted and managed the business. Weather is always going to play some role in our business results and it is our job to manage successfully to all those types of external factors. What we faced in the second quarter of this year was different than previous years and I believe we reacted accordingly. Now heading into the second quarter we anticipated that the quarter would start slow based on the cool weather patterns and late start to the spring selling season. Based on years past we expected that weather patterns would begin to normalize in May and we would see a spike in the spring seasonal business mid quarter. However that pattern did not hold true this year particularly in our northern markets where the weather turned warmer much later than normal. Instead of a spike we saw a much more gradual build in the seasonal business throughout the quarter. We reacted midway through the quarter by enhancing a few remaining key promotional events focusing on things that would drive sales and traffic while maintaining the integrity of our everyday value pricing model.  These promotions included the advancement of our 4th of July circular by one week, a second and more timely demo days sell event for the northern regions and an improved targeted distribution of our remaining circulars and direct mails. These actions resulted in improved redemption rates and while this had a modest impact on our overall margins in the quarter it did drive sales of seasonal categories midway through the quarter. As weather became less of a factor in the northern markets we noticed a return to more normal sales trends. The momentum continued as the quarter progressed but again this was much more gradual than years past. June sales were strong and that strength has carried over into the first few weeks of July. This has given us confidence that the weaker sales trends in the first half of the year were in fact weather related while our underlying fundamental traffic and core businesses remained healthy with sales that were lost early in the second quarter and as such we adjusted our full year outlook in our business update just two weeks ago. Tony will review the financials of the quarter in more detail but let me give you a few highlights. Comparable transaction count increased 2.3% making this our 25th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction count. Comparable store sales were positive in each of the three months with the second half of the quarter above our expectations and the first half below our expectations. Regionally comparable store sales in the south significantly outperformed comparable sales in the north and not all spring seasonal sales products performed the same. We observed strength in grass seed, live goods, fencing and riding lawn mowers and in riding lawn movers it's been several years since we've seen a positive year-over-year sales comparison in that category. But on the flip side we saw weakness in the outdoor power equipment such as tillers and chain saws as well as we saw weakness in accessories for mowers, trimmers and in the safe category. So for the quarter we made a number of inventory investments in key categories early on and we were pleased with how these categories performed. And we know that when we support product category from both a merchandizing and branding perspective and we place the inventory we typically do well and drive those sales that were re-targeted in those categories. For example our garden event, another big success again this year and that benefited from further investments in that category in both live goods and core products.  So while the early part of the quarter was not fully inline with our expectations we were pleased with the way it ended and the way that we managed the seasonal business and the underlying strength in our core business throughout the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of the financials after which I will offer a few closing comments and forward look on the second half of the year. Anthony F. Crudele : Thanks Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 28, 2014 on a year-over-year basis net sales increased 8.8% to $1.58 billion and net income grew by approximately 8% to $133.4 million and $0.95 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 1.9% for the second quarter compared to last year's increase of 7.2%. As Greg discussed the seasonal side of the quarter got off to a slow start as a result of the cold weather that continued further into May and in the prior year. Sales did not start to rebound until halfway through the quarter as spring finally broke and the build was much more gradual than last year. This was especially the case with our northern stores. Sales were consistent with our plan in the back half of the quarter at June posted a solid comp and was the strongest comp month in the quarter. Comparable store sales were driven by continued strength of consumable, usable and edible products, our C.U.E. items and healthy traffic counts. Comp transaction count increased from the 25th consecutive quarter, gained 2.3% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. Certain spring categories performed very well such as live good grass seeds and fencing. These favorable trends were partially offset by weaker than expected sales of other seasonal categories in the North and continued declines in our safe category resulting from difficult comparisons from a year ago.  Average comp ticket decreased by 30 basis points compared to last year's 2.3% increase. The decrease resulted principally from deflation of 100 basis points. An increase in items per transaction and favorable mix impact partially offset the negative impact of deflation.  The impact of big ticket was slightly negative as the increases we saw in the [inaudible] were more than offset by the declines in the safe category. A few key points about the quarter. As Greg mentioned, although we have seen solid comp sales performance in our spring seasonal categories in June and the first three weeks of July it is difficult to assess whether we will recapture all the lost sales resulting from the late spring. If you recall last year's third quarter benefited from a late and extended spring and summer selling season. Although the general pattern is similar to last year the build of the seasonal business has been more gradual this year and we do not know how this trend will progress. So while we are pleased with the comp performance so far in Q3 we do face difficult comparisons in the third quarter particularly in July and August when comps increase close to double-digits last year. On a regional basis, our warmer southern regions outperformed our cooler northern regions as the southern regions were the least impacted by the delayed spring weather. All three months had positive comp sales with June tracking at our internal comp target.  Although big-ticket items as a group had a positive comp for the quarter, it was still a slight headwind to average ticket. Since the big ticket comp percent was less than chain average and the big ticket sales were a smaller mix of total sales from the softness in the safe category it had a slight negative impact on average ticket.  Deflation was approximately 100 basis points which is slightly higher than we expected. Last year's second quarter had approximately 140 basis points of inflation making the year-over-year swing 240 basis points.  Turning now to gross margin, which as a percentage of sales was flat to prior year at 34.8%. Our initial direct margin improved as a result of our initiatives around price optimization, markdown management and strategic sourcing. Import purchases in the quarter increased 8.1% and represented 11.5% of the sales mix. Also exclusive brand sales increased 9.4% compared to last year's Q2 and were almost 30.7% of sales. Deflation was the most significant favorable factor impacting margin as we focused on maintaining margin dollars per unit that typically will result in an improvement in gross margin rate in deflationary periods.  Offsetting the benefits from deflation and our margin enhancing initiatives was merchandise mix which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately 13 basis points. This was primarily related to the rider category that has a lower than average margin and had a solid year-over-year increases, and the softness in several of the seasonal categories that carry above chain average margin. The softness in seasonal sales also resulted in C.U.E. being a higher mix of sales for the quarter which in aggregate carry a lower than average margin. Freight increased approximately 14 basis points as we had increased transportation rates related to inbound truck capacity and availability as well as an increase in store stem miles to the new western store base. Additionally the freight rate will increase as a percentage relative to sales and cost of goods in a deflationary period. The enhanced sales driving events during the quarter that Greg referred to also modestly impacted margin.  For the quarter SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 21.5% of sales, an increase of 27 basis points over the prior year quarter. Although we managed SG&A dollars well, we still de-levered as result of the short fall in sales. We knew that some of the investments we put in place in the second half of 2013 would make it difficult to leverage SG&A in the second quarter and this was exaggerated by the limited comp sales increase. We began to anniversary some of these investments in the back half of this year, for example we will cycle the added expense of the relocation of the Southeast distribution center and the relocation of our data center in the second half of 2014.  The largest variance was employee benefits where medical cost and workers' comp expense have been running higher than plan. Incentive compensation was favorable and offset a significant portion of the deleverage. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.7% in Q2 compared to 37.4% last year. The decrease was due principally to the timing of recognition of state and federal income tax credits. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2 this year and last year we had a cash balance of $36 million and no outstanding debt. During the second quarter under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 961,000 shares for $62.5 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on EPS for the quarter. Average inventory levels per store at quarter end were 3.4% lower than last year, while annualized inventory turns increased by three basis points for the quarter. We are pleased with the productivity of the inventory during the quarter as the team did an excellent job flowing early spring orders as sales demand warranted and managed seasonal inventories throughout the quarter. Overall we do not anticipate any markdown exposure in Q3 outside of our normal clearance activity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40.2 million, compared to $49.3 million last year. We opened 23 stores this quarter compared to 26 stores in the second quarter of 2013. The decrease in capital expenditure relates to expenditures for the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year. Turning our attention to full year outlook, based on the second quarter results the company believes its fiscal year 2014 results will be at the low end of the previous provided ranges which were net sales of $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion, comparable store sales of 2.5% to 4% and net income of $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. We have reduced our estimated range for capital expenditures by $20 million to $220 million to $230 million. The new store pipeline is tracking to our full year goal of 102 to 106 new stores. Based on the volume of our share repurchase year-to-date we are also adjusting our estimate for full year diluted shares outstanding to approximately 140 million. We now expect deflation to be higher than originally anticipated for the back half of the year as corn prices which is a directional indicator continue to remain low. We are now estimating deflation to range between 50 and 100 basis points in the second half with the third quarter being closer to the high end and moderating slightly down in the fourth quarter. The safe category will continue to be headwind but the merchant team has put together a solid plan to drive total sales in the back half of the year. We expect gross margin to be flat to slightly in the second-half of the year. The fourth quarter will be tougher comparison in the back half as strong seasonal sell through last year minimized markdowns. We will continue to have freight and mix headwinds that will offset some of the benefits of our key gross margin initiatives. With respect to SG&A, our store support center consolidation into our new campus is on budget and on time and will be completed before the end of the third quarter. The anticipated lease termination and transition cost will be incurred and expensed in the third quarter which we estimate to be $0.01 to $0.015 per diluted share. We have a very focused plan to manage SG&A expense in the back half of the year and we expect to leverage SG&A in the back half principally in the fourth quarter, as we begin to cycle the investments made in the back half of last year. We expect SG&A leverage to be closer to flat in Q3 as a result of the store support center transition cost I just mentioned. We forecast that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 36.9% compared to our previous guidance of 37%. To conclude our core business remains strong. We saw seasonal sales accelerated as the weather warmed and we managed the inventory properly positioning to try to supply for a healthy summer selling season.  So now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Thank you, Tony. Looking forward to the second half of 2014 we are focused on driving sales and operating margin growth for the full year. Last year the spring and summer selling season extended well into the third quarter and we benefited from having inventory in the right mix of seasonal products.  Our success in third quarter last year presents us with a challenging comparison this year but nevertheless we feel we are well prepared given how well we ended the second quarter with inventory and how we have successfully transitioned our assortments toward fall. In the second half of the year we have several merchandising initiatives which we are excited about including a number of direct mail campaigns, looking at a target distribution of our circulars and numerous in-store events focused on driving more footsteps into our stores.  While we will selectively sprinkle in a few individual store level efforts we are diligent in maintaining our everyday value pricing model. We also have our seasonal center court that I should mention where we also introduce new products that also support our customer\u2019s lifestyle and drive business. So in closing I\u2019d like to thank our dedicated team members in the field distribution centers and here at the store support center for all the hard work and dedication to our company and our shareholders and the investment community for your continued support. We feel comfortable about the underlying trends and fundamentals of our business but we recognize that we need to continuously raise the bar on execution to address the external business conditions that can change and have changed around us.  We appreciate your time today. And we will now open the call for your questions. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instruction). And we will take our first quarter from Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser - UBS : Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to dig a little bit further into the gross margin. The last quarter you got about a 100 basis points of gross margin expansion, it sounds like largely from the deflation element of your retail prices adjusting a little bit more slowly than the wholesale prices. You laid out some factors that restrained that in the quarter like 13 basis points of mix, 14 basis points from freight, you didn\u2019t call out promotions but you made sound like it was slightly less than that amount that would add up to around 40 to 45 basis points. So was there just less of a benefit from the deflation in the second quarter than there was in the first quarter or was there something else going on? Anthony F. Crudele: No, Mike I think I summarized it. The deflation was a little bit less of an impact although it clearly was the largest and then we did benefit from our price optimization and exclusive brands initiatives. So but between clearance which you are correct, it was -- it is relatively modest it was definitely less than 10 basis points and mix and promotion really were the drivers. And when it came to mix, like I had mentioned earlier you had riding lawn mowers which tend to be well below chain average, you also then we were very light in some category that generally are above chain average, some of the key spring categories. So that was the key part of the mix impact and then as consumables continued to increase as a percentage of sales that also caused the mix to be to have an impact. But other than that there was nothing significant relative to the margin. Michael Lasser - UBS : Okay. And the commentary about the promotions that you laid our during the quarter was very useful and it sounds like you could continue to follow some of that, those tactics, continue to use those tactics moving forward. Is there something that has changed about the customer or are you just digging into customers that are more expensive to attract and that\u2019s why you are having to run the promotions, is there anything different about the competitive environment? And then does that influence your thinking about the long run margin outlook for the business where you have consistently got to do 25 basis points or so of expansion but have quite better than that. Thank you very much. Gregory A. Sandfort: Michael this is Greg. First of all there is nothing significant that we can see that changed with our customer. They are still being conservative, they are still buying very close to need. What I think we saw was demand shifted later and as demand shifts later a lot of these customer say you know maybe I don\u2019t need to make that investment in x, y and z we clearly saw them not interested this year in some of the outdoor products that in years past that they have performed very well and by the way those are higher margin products that we count on in our second quarter mix. So that\u2019s the first thing. And I think we saw them pull back a little bit from what I\u2019ll discretionary spending on some things. I don\u2019t think there is any competitive pressures that we can see, that have caused any issues. So I would say to that, no haven\u2019t seen anything and I think in general our consumer will look at forward purchasing a little differently. We are already starting to see a good indication on some early reads and early sell-throughs on fall products in certain categories in our business but I won't get specifics from a competitive standpoint, but that is a very strong indication that they are looking forward, aren\u2019t looking back and that's really what we need from them right now. Michael Lasser - UBS : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks again. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird:  Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess following up on that a little bit, the inventory looked very well managed in the quarter. Does that limit your ability to capitalize on any extended spring selling season in Q3? And is that why maybe you're being a bit cautious on that or Greg maybe just a comment you just made that your customers are kind of looking forward? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Peter, two things. In some categories like some outdoor power equipment there will be a limited availability because either there is model change over or those manufacturing facilities have already moved on to making snow blowers and other type of winter products. So yeah, there will be some limit to that but we're able to grab some inventory before some of those conversions occurred. So I think we're sitting what we want to be with inventory and we think we can maximize what's left to the season. Again I think the customers, what we\u2019ve seen initial here is that they\u2019re already looking forward which is a good thing but they're still buying to need. And in some of our regions where we have lot of moisture and heat, some of outdoor park equipment categories have been just extraordinarily strong.  And we're basically feeding that business day to day. So mix of things going on right now. Good look at fall forward as well as still trying to capture some of those lost sales from spring. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Okay, fair enough. So my second question is just on the freight headwind that we saw in the quarter, I mean clearly the Western extension is expected to be a freight headwind here but I guess the in-bound capacity issue would seem somewhat new. So maybe you guys can talk a little bit about that and then whether you expect that persist going forward? Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele: Peter, Tony when it comes to the inbound freight rate there has been a lot of conversion about some of these incremental costs as far as the truck and availability, driver availability that has increased our cost. We do expect to have going forward and we have taken that in consideration in our forecast.  It is somewhat impactful. It does add some basis points to the freight in the impact. But again we believe that we can manage that to that end have included it in our forecast in back half. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then I guess just looking at the back half our gross margin kind of as you had said, kind of flattish to down a little bit in second half and I think you are clearly expecting the fourth quarter to be down given the comparison. Do you also expect that the third quarter gross margin to be down or you think it\u2019s going to be flat, just any color around that given what you're seeing so far? Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele:  As we look at the third quarter, we think that the gross profit is going to probably be more in the flattish range. We think that there is obviously more upside in Q3 than in Q4 because we did have such strong sell-through in the fourth quarter.  If we can continue to get good spring summer sell-through on some of the higher-margin goods there some potential upside there as well. But again just overall we try to stay away from the specific quarter guidance and try to keep it generic to the back half but we believe that there is a little bit more upside to Q3 than there is to Q4 when it comes to gross margin. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird:   Yeah, understood. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Magee with SunTrust. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey :  Hi. Good afternoon guys. Gregory A. Sandfort: Good afternoon. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : You may have said this and I may have missed it but the new store productivity we\u2019re getting around 75%, is that sound about right? Gregory A. Sandfort: That's correct, yes. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And that number is sort of the higher end of the range that you\u2019ve seen overtime, is there something that you're doing differently with these class of stores that's producing a better number? Gregory A. Sandfort: There is clearly a lot more research that's going to on before we open these stores because we're going to into new regions David and we\u2019ve spent time out there with the customer base, and our teams here at the store support center with our field people they are replacing out there. So much more focus on understand the consumer before we are out there opening more stores.  The second thing and I\u2019ve mentioned this before, we have a team of people here at the store support center that with any new store that opens in its first 12 months of its life there is bit of a, I\u2019ll call it a babysitting period where they really work very closely with that individual store understanding differences and needs, whether it be floor product, depth of product some change outs and planograms maybe some products that we need to introduce in the store because the customer demands so on and so forth.  So we spend that first 12 months with that new store trying to get that assortment and that new store positioned in that market before we turn it over and put into the run rate of the normal the rest of the company. So it\u2019s a unique process. It takes time, it takes people but it\u2019s paid big dividends for us. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks Greg. Anthony F. Crudele:  David, just to also clarify on that, as we move west the mix of the store is going to be a little larger. So it\u2019s a larger volume store. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Anthony F. Crudele:  So I should say you see that in a number of sort of increasing as a percentage of sales, total sales of the company or average store. Some of it is just due to the mix of the stores that we are opening. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey :  Thank Tony. And the secondly you mentioned you got a good book or some look in to the fall product demand and it\u2019s favorable. What products in particular are you looking at to see that? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Well, Dave unfortunately I can\u2019t tell you which categories because from a competitive standpoint, but there are four that are key to our business just as there are three or four to the spring season and there are great indicators of forward look or forward trend and what I can tell with great confidence is we have started off with very, very positive trends and we expect those will continue. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey :  Great, thanks and good luck. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research :  Good afternoon everyone. Gregory A. Sandfort: Good afternoon Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : Just want to reflect back on the North-South spilt a little bit. Can you comment on how that looked among the new stores you opened, the cold versus the warm area? Gregory A. Sandfort: Had lower warm than we had cold, that\u2019s for sure. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research :  Yeah. Anthony F. Crudele: You know Chuck, the newer stores as we grow in the Southwest are obviously going to be warm weather and as we had indicated earlier the southern stores did produce better than northern stores from a sales perspective. So for the most part we felt very good about the new stores and again they were specifically more in the south and obviously had a better opportunity to perform well during this delayed spring. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research :  All right, that makes sense. Thank you. Operator :  And we will take our next question from John Lawrence with Stephens. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc.:  Good morning guys. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Good morning, John. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Greg to follow that on the divergence between the north and the south, I mean was that the biggest spread and the largest spread between those regions you have seen in some time as far as that say April and May and part of June performance? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Yes it was. Lee you want talk to that? Lee J. Downing:  I think, John, the different in the north-south typically over the last I\u2019d few quarters we have been relatively consistent across all regions but I think we, this time we saw we saw quite differentiation in particular with the northeast in kind of the Mid-Atlantic areas that they did not perform up to the area. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: And is it fair to say Greg your comments on some of the forward-looking, is it fair to say that those lines have converged and when weather is sort of a parity in both places that they look a lot similar going forward? Gregory A. Sandfort:  That is correct. And I will say that it echoing what Lee said, you know we still are seeing very consistent traffic and what happened really in the North versus the South was the mix in the basket was so different from a year ago and as the weather is warm in both locations now both parts of the country we are seeing very similar selling patterns, but we are also seeing a nice movement forward in business across the country. So very happy with that so far. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Well, thanks, good luck. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator :  And then we will take our next question from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Thanks, good evening. Gregory A. Sandfort: Good evening Chris. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: As you talk about, as you think about really the first seven months of the year it would encouraged us to look at the business in terms of halfs and maybe including the July date is the right way to look at -- what do you think the core underlying trend in the business is, you had some early help from the cold and then it hurt you and then you had this delayed spring but now it seems to be helping you. So what's the right underlying trend in the business? Gregory A. Sandfort : Well, let me, kind of bracket it for you. The first thing is there have been some comments about volatility but it's really not volatility. This is really I think we can give some great examples of how consistent some things are and the underlying components of the business. Number one, comp store traffic counts, they remain strong. They were very consistent and that's an underlying piece of the core business that the customers are still coming in and making purchases into and other products in store. Second thing the basket, the basket changed quite a bit in the first quarter this year versus a year ago and as the demand increased based upon the warmth of the weather and I hate to use weather but weather did have an impact, it then started to affect how the mix of basket and sales of products were from the stores. So the north and the south look very different in sales for the first five, six months.  This was probably some of the most extreme weather, honestly we've ever seen at least for the time I have been with the company. So we dealt with it but it was clearly a shifting of product mix and demand from consumer of certain products based upon the fact that you get out and either in the yards, work in the gardens, do work outside in general. So underlying it's good. Now deflation had some impact, no question. Deflation played a role but I think generally speaking demand shifted later in the north and the upper mid-west and that we saw pretty normalized business in more mid-west than south. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: And then as you think about the feed and food category aspects I guess maybe for -- on a unit basis. Is that -- has the growth in that business moderated, has there been much change there? I think some of the dog category it seems like there is some consternation out there on the dog category. But overall as you think about dog and horse has the food and feed category been pretty good for you? Gregory A. Sandfort : I can tell you that our unit counts were up in both categories. So we are continuing to take market share. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay. And then, perfect. In the July commentary is it fair to say that July is an unassisted comp and some of the questions focusing on the promotional level here, I think people -- investors were trying to understand that you are driving the business or being forced to drive the business through promotions. Is the July commentary about trend largely in unassisted or unpromoted. Gregory A. Sandfort : Yes, Chris, July is a return to more normal but we would expect it would be the performance of tractor supply as we known it. Yeah, we did nothing to further assist the business this is just a good solid trend of business that honestly just came later. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Perfect. Thanks very much. Gregory A. Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : Hi guys. I guess everyone\u2019s kind of talking around it but can you give us an idea for how big the difference was between the south and northeast and whether is a range or some other way to think about it? Gregory A. Sandfort : Yeah. I think when you look at it, I guess we can give you some range but what's interesting is that as we progressed in the quarter, we did start to see the north come back. So as much as we feel that there was little bit of some lost sales there, it did start to moderate some. So when you look across the chain and if you look at it from a full year basis actually the northeast came back very nicely. When you look at some of the range, it's probably somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points of swing between north and the south far as the performance of those regions, when it comes to sort of the spring categories. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : Got you, that's very helpful. And then I don't know how you really answer that, I mean Greg you kind of talked about, you didn't really see a change in consumer behavior but obviously there are some people out there thinking that there are significant deflationary forces on some of your core customers with corn et cetera. So maybe if you can just give us some of your thoughts on if that could have some sort of impact on your overall customer base or what's the right way for investors to kind of think about that as a potential impact on the business? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort : Well the first thing I would say is that what gives us comfort is the fact that we were having consistent growth in our transaction count at the store. So our customer base continuous to shop with us and it continuous to grow. I would tell you that in many of the products we sell, corn is a very small component. However it\u2019s a good indicator of what can happen with the rest of grains and other mixtures and products in feed and food.  We have not seen any shift downward in quality of the product that the customer is buying or them buying any less of and we saw that back in the earlier part of the recession if you remember you have been following the company back in \u201908 we saw customers trading down into lower price feeds and foods, we are not seeing that at all, not seeing at all. As a matter of fact many customers, I think are seeing great value and understanding that, that a better quality feed or food is better for animals. So no indications of that there were some challenges, no question. In the early part of the year with weather and being able to run trucks and get product to stores but that was past us so the second quarter really was more of, it was circled around the demand for other seasonal products and the C.U.E. categories are performing very well, we are very pleased with those and we believe because of that traffic count and the unit increases that business is solid. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys. Anthony F. Crudele:  This is Tony. We have done some analysis in sort of the more rural areas where we would expect the farm income to have an impact and we have not seen any large disparities relative to the performance of the stores in those areas. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets : Got you, all very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities :  Hi, there. Gregory A. Sandfort : Hi. Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities :  Our question really around the consumer and I am trying to understand your concern little bit better. On the one hand you are talking about strength in some big ticket discretionary categories like riding lawn mowers and on the other hand you are talking about more limited behavior or sales in other high margin discretionary things in the spring. How do you juxtapose those things and what do you think the consumer is really thinking right now? Gregory A. Sandfort: This is Greg. I think it\u2019s a simple answer. Some of those what I call discretionary purchases are more ornamental and decorative types things and there is a life to those. Typically you buy them early, you kind of use them and they transition from year-to-year. Our customers typically shop on need, so I think because of the delay and their ability to use some of those products, particularly some of outdoor products they may have made some decision to say no I am going to continue to support the things I need and I am going to move on and I\u2019ll look forward to next season.  And what we did was when we start seeing that trend we started to moderate our inventory levels in those categories and manage ourselves to a successful conclusion. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything unusual particularly given how late the season developed. Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, as you think about the gross margin outlook being a little bit limited going forward, are you guys changing your cost control measures to offset that in anyway? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Seth, we have a hard look at the back half and we believe we have a very focused approach around SG&A and that\u2019s why we have adjusted our outlook relative to the SG&A where we believe that we can drive some leverage from SG&A in the back half for the year. Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities : Anything specific that you can point to? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Well, obviously there is some discretionary spend. There is also some initiatives that we\u2019ve been able to manage more efficiently and some that we discontinued to make sure that we don\u2019t spend ahead of the benefits that we receive from some of the key initiatives and we had been able to manage some of the CapEx spend as well around those projects. So we believe that those are few things that we have done relative to drive some expenses and obviously we are always looking at things like managing labor and some of the key occupancy expenses when it comes to repairs and maintenance but at the same time we want to make sure that we take care of our store base.  So it\u2019s a balancing act but we really feel that as we move into the back half the plan that we put together we can achieve some SG&A leverage. Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities : Got it, thank you. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Company:  Hi, good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort: Good afternoon. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Company: Can you talk about if you can estimate the magnitude of the comp lift or the sale lift that promotions drove the business and then if I interpreted it right, the promotional levels were they similar to cadence of sales growth meaning the promotions were let's say more prevalent in the month of June versus the other months of the quarter? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Simeon, this is Greg. I would say two things on that. One is, it was moderate as far as impact on sales and moderate impact on margin, so minimum. What we already had as weather started to change we happened to be, I think in the right place at the right time with some of the promotions we had already put into play. And for example by shifting the July fourth piece up a week that just gave us a little bit of more time to understand where is the customer on some of these products It typically all you are doing is shifting the business typically earlier sometimes versus extending it out but we tried that to see if we get any kind of comp increase out of it. So it had some effect not a large degree of effect. We're already starting to see some turning of the business in the positive direction and the comps as Tony mentioned were significantly better in June and it continued into July. And July has been a month where we\u2019ve changed nothing. It's been exactly the same and we didn't do anything really significant in the month of June, nothing like going out and dropping another piece of circular or circulation for two to three main customers which would be a normal drop for us. We didn't do that.  This was more local store type event, something we can do from inside the store. And I leave with that. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Company: Okay. And then on the feed business you mentioned your units in dog or one of the categories was up, you were probably taking share, can you talk about where you think that's coming from? Is it the same customer who is buying large animal feed, are you pulling from more of suburban market, so maybe from the strip center customer, where that coming from or is there also and is the private label or your private offering within that growing faster than the brands? Gregory A. Sandfort : I can't tell you exactly what's going to come, Simeon. I wish I knew. We do our best to try to track that. I think in general, our pricing structure, our in-stock levels and our offering and mix tends to drive customers to our stores.  We are seeing nice growth, continued growth in our own exclusive brands. That's a range for people to come to our store, you can only buy those at Tractor. So I think this has been something we\u2019ve seen for a while and we see it continuing as we increase the depth and breadth of those assortments in our stores. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley :  Okay, thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Go ahead. Alan Rifkin - Barclays:  Thank you very much. Greg, understanding the perishability components of your commodity side of the business, is there anything at all that can be done by you guys on a proactive basis to try to take advantage or somehow not be as susceptible to the declining prices in commodities be it slowing your turns or anything? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Well, a couple of things we have there. We made some significant investments in inventory that we would forecast with our suppliers but we don't buy -- we're not buying the commodity type products, when out there. And the fact that we've been able to build exclusive brands in our company and that's a base of business that we can control from a slow margin and exclusivity standpoint helps us but I\u2019m not in the futures business, don't plan to be. And I think we do a fine job today working that inventory and turning that inventory. We're not having out of stock issues. What we're having more of is trying to look at what's the next level of business in some of our exclusive brands more so than even some of the national brands on occasion. So it's a good mix, and it's good healthy mix. We need both. Alan Rifkin - Barclays: Okay. I mean you said on more than one occasion that the buildup was more gradual than what you anticipated. I mean what do you think is really behind that? Is it a macro issue? Gregory A. Sandfort : I think -- we are convince now looking on how the business developed, it was primarily weather because as things normalized, when weather normalized business was back to like I said the typical what we would call Tractor Supply performance. So I don't like to use weather as any type of issue but it clearly was driven primarily North and the Coastal side of the Midwest. And that area of the country just didn\u2019t respond until the weather actually warmed and once it did business normalized. So and we are clearly convinced it was the weather. Alan Rifkin - Barclays: Okay. And one more question if I may. I know it\u2019s been asked ten different ways but with respect to the weather I mean besides the north, did you hit your plan in all other areas whatever that plan maybe? Gregory A. Sandfort:  When you say hit the plan do you mean sales in other regions? Alan Rifkin - Barclays: Yeah. Gregory A. Sandfort:  The answer to that would be yes we did. We actually accelerated in a number of regions beyond plan so significant weakness in the north and in the Mid-Atlantic, significant strength in other parts of the country. Alan Rifkin - Barclays: Okay, got you. Thank you very much. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark Miller - William Blair & Company:  Hi, good afternoon. Seems like one of the swing fact, the gross margin near term would be some of these spring seasonal categories that you talked about and you highlighted the importance of three or four, going forward, three or four looking back. Could you give little more perspective on what some of the three-four spring categories that you are hoping to see good call through late in the season? Gregory A. Sandfort: Well one of the categories is the riding lawn motor business. It\u2019s been exceptional this year and we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because honestly the season just developed late and equipment from last year were up or it\u2019s we are going to just -- advantage just likely we have, we have inventory in quality products and maybe people will compete with a sell-through, things like suppliers and chemicals those are business that typically start early in the season and when they came later as they have this year I\u2019ll give an example, we are talking -- we are hearing that cutting of hay this year there is probably still two cuttings left. Well at this time a year ago there would have maybe one.  The twine business is extremely strong and why is that? Well there forecasted more cutting and things so, there is some unusual things year-to-year either happening but they are delayed and are still coming so, you know our biggest challenge right now is managing trying to gain the maximum return on the inventory we have in those categories and then also transitioning to fall and then I said earlier we are very pleased with we are seeing in some of the early indications of the some of the fall sets in some of the northern region and so you know I feel quite good right now about the mixes inventory how things are selling through but is unusual, this is not a typical year that we wouldn\u2019t be seeing some of the selling of some of these products this late in the season. Mark Miller - William Blair & Company:  Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then something apart from the weather, on the import purchases up around high single-digit in the first-half. That had been growing a little bit faster than total sales in the past. So I guess can you kind of give us a sense for what is your current outlook for higher penetration of import which are the categories again are you really focusing on and if you think that will star accelerating again or you\u2019re kind of getting closer to where the business can go? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort: Mark I have always stated that there is no set numbers for us as far as a target but it will shift between you know seasons this year and we did pull back a little bit on some, I\u2019ll call it import products in the outdoor category and I think it was a good move on merchants\u2019 part because it was a category unfortunately that was soft this year. It wasn\u2019t because of the inventory because the customer just decided that that income was going somewhere else.  We still see growth, we still see the machine behind our product development and sourcing piece of the company growing. I still think that we will see, I don\u2019t know it could 300, 400, 500 basis points of more growth as we get into end of the year and in to next year still so there is no slowing of that conversion but I don\u2019t have a target number to give you. I think it would be wrong to say because it\u2019s a totally different mix between the parts of the business, some piece is a higher percentage others low so look for you know continued improvements and increases in the mix. Mark Miller - William Blair & Company:  That\u2019s helpful, great. Thanks. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler - Deutsche Bank :  Yes, good afternoon guys, thank you. So two questions one, sorry both on weather. One, if you remind us what an extended season mean for you guys specifically what it about the weather last year that helped drive double-digit comps in July and August? And then as it relates to the commentary on fall, just wondering if that was concentrated in sort of the Ohio, Michigan, Western New York Pennsylvania areas which did see for whatever reason a very late hold of Vortex over the last couple of weeks the temperatures dropping very well below average just to make sure we're not getting sort of a false lead on that? Gregory A. Sandfort : Let me address your last piece, there is no false read here. What you got is our consumers last year honestly were caught a little short on a number of categories of products because we had a very what I would gracious long winter. So what we typically have seen in the history of our company is when that happens they start to buy earlier for the next year in an effort not to get caught short and in an effort to make sure that they will start on product. So that's what I think is happening there pulling Vortex aside. As far as the other weather things what you see is extension, ironically this year is -- they are still planting grass seed they are still putting in gardens, they are still cutting hay. There is a number of things that typically would start to be winding down at this time of the year, that are still very vibrant up the Midwest in the coastal areas and the Carolinas and up to the northeast.  So that\u2019s going to play itself out for a while and we are still seeing again some forward buying but I like what we're seeing is the reaction to, I'll call it a late spring but they will come a point of time and it will be right around labor day or shortly before that will shift again and we are in great shape to take advantage of that. Adam Sindler - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Very good. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. What I'm trying to get a handle on is the historical kind of perspective of the promotions you mentioned you\u2019re kind of sprinkling in some promotions which I understand but just remind of the history of that when you done that last and how it kind of developed, if you don't mind. Gregory A. Sandfort : Aram we have been doing that for a number of years now and it's not really promotion. What it is store level, I'll call it customer interactions, whether we would do a farmers market on a weekend in a group of stores in a certain part of the country or we would have a pet swap meet or something. I mean it's all kind of interesting things that our marketing department has researched and developed and they are really local store events that we give the stores the opportunity to execute to and we actually put together a marketing package for them that\u2019s done at the store.  So understand it's not about more promotion and it's not about on sale. This is we are an everyday price value company and that's how customers have come to trust us on pricing. So these are events that draw customers to the store they are primarily geared on the weekends and there is really a menu of things that they can use and we usually give them some guidance but we've been doing this for a number of years now. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: And maybe just last question is we are trying to rebound to get back to normal which is kind of let\u2019s say 3.5 or 4 something maybe for the back half and in years past doing the 3.5 and the 4 wouldn't have kind of passed muster because you were comping up six, sevens and eight. I'm just wondering kind of the new normal kind of 3 to 4 and what can you do to get back to the old normal, because those were even better still? Gregory A. Sandfort : Great question, not a simple answer. You know some of the things that I am encouraged about is that we are continuing to find new products and able to take some businesses that we thought had cycled through and were kind of mature and actually breathe some new life into them. We talked a little bit early about the safe business. That business was running hot for a number of years and we knew it's going to soften at some point. So it's one of those things when you look at those businesses and you say how do you offset that, how you continue to grow it well.  Sometimes if a pie gets smaller you have to go and look at how to get more of that pie. But I think in general we are going to continue to do the things that we think we do best and that is introduce new products, use in store events and things to bring customers through, introduce them to new products, make sure we\u2019re in stock and watch those in stock levels and make those investments and really look at maximizing probably three or four key categories each season where we believe we have a dominant position.  You know we've learned that we get behind some of these categories from a merchandise presentation and branding and promotion level we can drive the business and I think we can do it at healthy margin. So there is more for us to do, unfortunately we have seen a little bit of some weather challenges that have gotten in the way but I believe we\u2019ll get back to being the Tractor you know here shortly. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: Thanks, I hope so, bye. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our next question Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Jon Berg - Piper Jaffray :  Great, thanks for taking our question. This is actually Jon Berg on for Pete tonight. It sounds like you guys have talked about corn being you know a deflation kind of indicator on the business and just curious about what you have seen with oil and steel in your business so far this year and how you are looking at those categories for the second half? Anthony F. Crudele:  Jon, this is Tony. The big driver as far as our adjustment to deflation is really corn prices. When we look at the other two factors which is oil and scraps steel are the other two indicators for our business. We did see some flattening out when it came to oil. But as we look at the back half of the year we don\u2019t believe that those two indicators will be a significant driver of the deflation/inflation in the back half. Jon Berg - Piper Jaffray : Okay, great. And then just quickly a second question. When did the softness in the safe category really start to set in and I mean how long do you anticipate that core category being a headwind? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Right the safe category has really been a headwind just the last two quarters so really 2014 and obviously the big driver has been some of the gun control issues that are there, especially the when it surfaced after Sandy Hook. So last year was very, very strong gun safe sales year and again most retailers have talked about that, especially in the sporting goods area about the softness of the industry. Jon Berg - Piper Jaffray : Okay, great. Thanks a lot and good luck in the second-half. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Thank you. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research :  You spoke briefly on the west stores and the relative size and sales volume. Curious if you can talk a bit about the margin experience at this point and what you think as you forward as you open more stores out there specifically on the gross margin opportunity, what you are seeing and learning from those stores? Gregory A. Sandfort: As we move west obviously we like the sales volume of those stores. As we talked in the past the real estate cost are more expensive. So from a modeling standpoint they fit into our model, from an economic standpoint. What we see in the gross margin side it\u2019s going to vary slightly but we do like what we see from a gross margin perspective. Those territories that are a little competitive obviously are going to be much stronger. Some of that gross margin that we -- that is above chain average can be eaten up a little by the additional freight. So as we eventually get our distribution center out there at the end of 2015, hopefully some of that freight degradation will moderate some.  So net-net we really like what we see out there from a sales standpoint and from a gross margin standpoint and we believe there will be a very profitable segment of the business? Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : From a mix, I understand the comments from competition, from a mix of what you are selling there and I suppose competition is well when the smoke clears and the infrastructure is there to supply those stores, is that likely to be a similar, better or worse gross margin relative to the existing business? Gregory A. Sandfort: I think net it will be a better gross margin business. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research :  And then secondly, as it relates to -- Greg I understood the comments on some of the marketing things you have done with promotions and connecting with customers, but from a merchandising standpoint, curious if there is anything new or incremental either specifically or strategically that you are doing, merchandising to help grow the sales as we look out this year and in to next year if there is anything changing materially there that you can speak to? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Eric, there are number of things that we are doing differently but again I am reluctant to speak to in specific terms but I can tell you this that we still drive a lot newness into our stores that\u2019s how we learn really where our customer is headed. They give us great indication very early on. So the testing programs are still robust and you will see as you travel our stores you will be able to tell where the focus is at. There is no question, you will see the investment behind inventory, you will see it in some of the promotions that we will run out there in print and online. So I would say to you that the pipeline is still full of new initiatives and new products and we continue to learn from the web business which is interesting there is some things that the web is teaching us about demand and about some products even in some price tiers that we can sell on the web and we are now are feeling that we can sell in store. So both are working nicely in tandem. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. This is [Omera] on for Matt. You had previously mentioned a high level of moisture on the ground which is traditionally a tailwind to sale. Is that moisture still on the ground and then is it a potential benefit in Q3 and does that benefit sort of disappear when we get in around this time of the year? Gregory A. Sandfort : Well traditionally we start seeing -- if you look at the -- we look at weather maps and we look at those forecasts and what we've seen is that this year in the Southwest and as we go to the Midwest and that no question that more moistures drive broader sales, it drives weed control and bug infestations and all those types of things. So those businesses still have a little bit of running room. But we haven't seen any kind moisture in those areas for a while. We've typically seen the maps showing a lot of drought. So that helped us this year a bit in the south and the southwest. I don't think it's going to give us any great benefit in third quarter. I think it's more you know in the second quarter obviously will benefit from that. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group : Hi guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you know I know you talked a lot about marketing promotion and the cadence and I apologize if I missed this during the call but any update on an Affinity type program I know you guys don't want to give away anything we've talked about that in the past, but just any, anything new on that front because I know you\u2019ve talked about testing different things on the Affinity side? Gregory A. Sandfort : Yeah. You are correct. We are still in the testing modes and we are, I would say developing a position now on what we believe will work tractor supply. It is not an additional discount type program as many of these programs turn out to be. This is different and we will be able to tell you more about that as the year progresses. Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group :  That's great. And then I wanted to go back to something I think a question or two ago you had brought up some comments about learning some things from the web and online sales and I guess I kind of wanted to broaden that out to like are you seeing anything shifting towards the web because I think there is this general view out there and certainly we have it that your business is somewhat defensive against the internet and I am wondering if you've seen any shifts in the business model that may suggest there is categories that do lend itself to e-commerce and maybe not a threat from Amazon but at least maybe more benefit for you to sell via the web? Gregory A. Sandfort: I think generally speaking because we continue to see footsteps and traffic being very consistent in the store, what happens for us is the web becomes a facilitator and people use it for research. There are some products we are learning though that we can sell on the web and I'll give example of one, chicken coops. Now you may say that it's kind of a silly category to talk about but we can sell very high end coops on the web and much larger scale coops on the web than we can even sell from and really facilitate our presentation in our stores for. And that was an category that to be honest with you we weren\u2019t sure that it was going to work as well as it did. It\u2019s been terrific.  I also say to you that the web also teaches us a little bit about price transparency and when it comes to things like a [drill] that's not going to be a category, I am going to spend a lot of time and money on because honestly that drill is out there from everybody at a price. But I will have it and I will have an assortment so that my customer sort of meets their needs but what I will find is other products in other categories are things that are unique to me that I can offer my customer around that can\u2019t be found on the website or if it is you have to search multiple places to find it. But our whole focus is to use that web piece as an extension of the stores and to use it as a piece of communication as well as to drive commerce and we are very pleased with the progress we are seeing there and what it is again, there is some teaching going in forth between both of those groups, the store level group and the web group on how to manage some of our businesses and what we can sell. Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks and have a good quarter guys. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Thank you. Operator :  And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Yeah, this concludes our second quarter earnings call. I like to thank you all for your interest in Tractor Supply and we look forward to speaking to you again on our third quarter earnings call in October. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and CFO; Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate. The team here at Tractor Supply delivered a solid third quarter performance and we are very pleased with our results. Sale was strong across the board and benefited from an extended spring/summer selling season and the early sales of fall/cold weather products. Our business performed consistently from month-to-month and region to region with each of the regions delivering mid-single-digit comp increases for the quarter. Comparable store sales increased 5.6% versus an increase of 7.5% in the last year\u2019s third quarter, which was our most difficult quarterly comparison for the year. The comp increase was driven by a strong performance in both traffic and ticket. Comp store transaction count increased 3.3% and average ticket increased 2.2%. This represents our 26th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. Now, with the delayed beginning of the spring selling season in many of our markets this year, I felt the team did a terrific job managing product assortments and inventory levels to capitalize on the shift in the weather. We experienced strong sell-throughs of seasonal categories such as lawn and garden supplies, live goods, outdoor power equipment, fencing and agricultural chemicals for the quarter. We also saw strength on the left hand side of our store in categories such as hardware, truck and tool. Now we updated a number of these plan-o-grams during the earlier part of the year and these changes clearly contributed to our increase in comparable store sales. And also big ticket sales increased for the quarter, driven by both late summer and early fall seasonal product sales in such categories as outdoor power equipment and heating. Based on our experience that a cold extended winter season like we had earlier this year can result in early fall buying. We delivered our heating and cold weather items earlier this year and we experienced a solid sales response from our customers without any additional major promotions to our exiting event calendar. Now, there were a number of other achievement in the quarter and let me highlight those. Our annual Pet Appreciation Week or P.A.W event as we call it, occurred in the third quarter again this year, and we again experienced a great response. And just as a reminder for those of you who are not familiar with this, this is a week-long event that promotes pet adoption and pet health awareness. We partner with local pet adoption agencies and community groups to promote pet adoptions and we offer exceptional values on pet products throughout all our stores. Year-after-year the P.A.W event continues to position us an authority for pet food and pet care. The opening of our new store support center on-time and on-budget was another highlight. The new building which was designed to be lead certified consolidated our three previous store support center locations into one facility, bringing all of our dedicated team members into a single campus setting. Deferred from the new store support center, we also opened our new plan-o-gram facility which we call our merchandised innovation center or MIC. This now give us the ability to review, analyze, and approve multiple plan-o-grams and floor sets in a full sized store environment before the proposed rollout to our stores. This will also prove to be a big time saver for our merchant and digital display teams. Now turning to the fourth quarter, we plan to open our first Tractor Supply store in Utah, which will be the 49th state for Tractor Supply and we recently opened our first Tractor Supply store in the State of Washington and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to grow our market share in the Washington markets as we introduce Tractor Supply store as a format to our loyal customers. Additionally, we continue to remain very pleased with the overall performance of all our new stores that are opening in the West. Now in late 2015, we will open a new distribution center to support store growth in the West and the Southwest regions and while we have not announced the exact location yet, we\u2019re in the process of finalizing the agreements and acquiring the land for the new building and we expect to be in a position to provide more information shortly. We also recently leased a second distribution facility in Hagerstown, Maryland and we plan to be shipping products in this facility in early 2015. This new facility will support our continued plans for growth in the Northeast. And finally, in mid November, we plan to open two HomeTown Pet stores near our store support center here in Brentwood, Tennessee. HomeTown Pet is a new and unique pet supply store that will offer high quality products and services in inviting and welcoming atmosphere for a large variety of pets and animals including dogs, cats, poultry, wild bird, horses and more. With our test and learn philosophy as a company, we believe these two stores will serve as great vehicles for us to improve our customer insights and product selections in the local markets we served. And as you know, pet has been a growing and important category for Tractor Supply for some time and we think these stores will help us to further develop our pet business. We have not determined our future expansion plans for this concept, but we\u2019ll apply the initial earnings back into our Tractor Supply stores to grow our sales. Tractor Supply sells products that people need and use every day. Our goal is to sell these products at great prices, keep them in stock and make it very easy for our customers to shop in our stores. Customers trust us to have what they need and when they need it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s relatively cool in May or usually warm in November. It\u2019s our job to anticipate these needs so they have to merchandise our customers\u2019 want. Improved tools in analytic scenarios such as price management, demand planning and inventory allocation will help us meet our customers\u2019 needs and we believe by doing so this will benefit our sales and margin growth over the long-term. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our dedicated team members out there who work so hard to meet our customers\u2019 needs each and every day. Whether it be in our stores, distribution centers or at the Store Support Center, they delivered a strong third quarter, and we as a company continue to believe that the underlying trends and fundaments of our business are solid. We all know that retailing is a challenging, but exciting business that is always changing and I believe we have the right people and tools in place to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value creation for many years to come. We appreciate your time today. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tony for additional commentary on the third quarter financials and our full year outlook. Tony? Anthony F. Crudele: Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 27, 2014 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12.6% to $1.36 billion. Net income grew by approximately 18.3% to $76.6 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 5.6% for the third quarter, compared to last year\u2019s increase of 7.5%. Similar to last year, we experienced a late spring as ground moisture and mild temperatures extended the spring selling season, resulting in strong sales and favorable seasonal sell-through. The animal and pet category continued to perform well with solid comps despite deflationary pressures. Seasonal categories such as gardening and live goods, outdoor recreation, fencing, riding lawn mowers and repair, all performed very well. Additionally, the third quarter sales benefitted from early fall/winter purchases as the cooler weather later in the quarter served as a reminder of last year\u2019s harsh winter. Comp transaction count increased for the 26th consecutive quarter, gaining 3.3% on top of a 6.7% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by continued strength of consumable, usable and edible products and the strong performance of the seasonal categories. Average comp ticket increased 2.2% compared to last year\u2019s 0.8%. The increase was driven by the mix of goods and the strength of big ticket sales, partially offset by deflation. A few key points about the quarter, we had a solid comp sales trend in July and August against a very tough sale comparison from last year, and we also had a similar late spring. Comp sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter with all three months having positive mid-single digit comp sales. All regions performed well, as both the north and south benefitted from the extended spring season and the north in particular benefited from the early fall seasonal sales. Taking out the positive impact on the average ticket, as the overall big ticket comp was about chain average and big ticket transaction account remains consistent as a percent of the total sales. Strength in our seasonal categories such as outdoor power equipment drove the positive big ticket comp sales increase, despite the continued headwind in the safe category. Depletion was approximately 90 basis points. Last year\u2019s third quarter had approximately 100 basis points of inflation, a swing of 190 basis points. Turning now to gross margin, which declined 29 basis points, our initial direct margin improved as a result of our initiatives around price management and strategic sourcing. Import purchases in the quarter increased 26.9% and represented 11.4% of the sales mix. Also exclusive brand sales increased 13.2% compared to last year\u2019s Q3 and were approximately 30.7% of sales. Deflation was the most significant favorable factor impacting margin. As we focus on maintaining margin dollars per unit, this typically will result in an improvement in gross margin rate in deflationary period. Offsetting the benefit from deflation and our margin enhancing initiatives was merchandise mix which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately 12 basis points. The mix impact resulted from the strength in sales in live goods, power equipment and the heating categories, which all have lower than chain average margin and had solid year-over-year increases. Freight increased approximately 23 basis points as we had higher transportation costs from the mix of merchandise in the quarter and the increase in stem miles to new western store base. As Greg had mentioned, our promotional cadence was similar to last year and had only a slight negative impact on margin. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 25.2% of sales, an improvement of 84 basis points over the prior quarter. We were pleased with our expense control in the quarter, which coupled with a strong comp sales provided significant leverage. Incentive compensation had a favorable impact on the expense leverage and represented over a third of the leverage benefit. The prior year quarter had a substantial bonus accrual based on the strength of that quarter relative to the full year. Additionally, we saw employee medical and workers comp expense moderate from Q2 levels and was more in line with our expectations. This leverage was achieved despite incurring the majority of our new store support center transition costs, which included lease write-offs for two properties. We estimate that this had a drag on the P&L of approximately $0.01. Our effective income tax rate in Q3 was 37%, compared to 36.1% last year. The rate was consistent with our expectation. The year-over-year increase was due principally to the reduction in the federal [WOTC] (ph) tax credit. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q3 we had cash balance of $48 million, compared to $46 million last year. We had an outstanding short-term debt of the $150 million, compared to $40 million last year. As we had a higher fall seasonal inventory build at the end of the quarter, and made significant purchases in our stock repurchase program during the quarter. During the third quarter under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 1,574,000 shares for a total of $97.4 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on the EPS for the quarter. Average inventory levels to store at quarter end were 3.7% higher than last year. While annualized inventory turns increased by nine basis points for the quarter. We are pleased with the productivity inventory during the quarter, as the team did an excellent job allocating inventory to key categories and making sure we restocked for the extended spring season. Additionally, we brought several key fall winter categories in early and are well prepared for the upcoming season. As result of the prolonged spring season we do not have significant markdown exposure as we move into the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43.3 million, compared to $58.2 million last year. We opened 30 stores this quarter, compared to 23 stores in the third quarter of 2013. The decrease in capital expenditure relate to cycling expenditures over the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year. Turning to our outlook, based upon the third quarter results, the company has increased its fiscal 2014 guidance from the low end of the previously provided ranges to the high end of the ranges, which were net sales of $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion, comparable store sales of 2.5% to 4% and net income of $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. We have reduced our estimates of capital expenditures to range between $190 million to $200 million as we have better visibility to the timing of some of our larger projects such as the Southwest distribution center, and our Northeast distribution center expansion project. And we do not anticipate any purchases of leased stores in the fourth quarter. Although some of these projects will move into 2015, we will not raise our target of $215 million of CapEx in 2015 which is consistent with our capital expenditure long term plan. New store pipeline is tracking to our full year goal of 102 to 106 new stores. Based on the volume of our share repurchase year-to-date, we believe that our year-end cash balance will be about $25 million to $50 million compared to our previously stated target of $100 million to $150 million. We\u2019re also adjusting our estimate for full year diluted shares outstanding to approximately 139.5 million. In the fourth quarter, we now expect deflation to moderate down just slightly from the Q3 levels in range between 60 basis points and 90 basis points. This would put deflation at the high end of our original full year guidance of flat to 100 basis points. We expect gross margin to be down slightly in fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is our toughest quarterly comparison due to the strong seasonal sell through and minimal markdowns last year. We expect to have continued freight and mix headwinds to offset some of the benefits of our key gross margin initiatives. We have been very disciplined in our management of SG&A expense in the back half of the year and we expect to leverage SG&A in the fourth quarter. We have begun to cycle some of the investments we\u2019ve made in the back half of last year making the comparisons a little easier. We forecast that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 37% consistent with our previous guidance. Although I will provide full guidance year end conference call consistent with our past practices, I wanted to highlight some of the larger capital projects and incremental expenses for 2015. The construction of our Southwest Distribution Center and the related pre-opening expenses, expansion of the capabilities of our Northeast distribution facility by adding additional lease base close to the current facility in the first quarter of next year, the building of two to three mixing centers next year, system improvements in our omni channel platform, enhanced IT security and demand planning and forecasting tools, higher transportation cost from additional stem miles resulting from our continued expansion in the west. Over the past two years, the company has invested in many initiatives to position itself for long term growth. We have managed the business and related investment spending to absorb these costs in our financial model, while delivering strong bottom line growth. Therefore, as we continue to invest in the long term growth of the company, our goal is to execute these incremental investments, such as those I just mentioned, while managing the financial impact to enable us to deliver against our annual EPS target of mid-teens growth. To conclude, we are very pleased with our results and execution in the third quarter. We believe that we took advantage of the extended spring summer selling season and well positioned to finish the year strong and deliver another solid growth year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Good job and thanks for the color on the call. That was helpful. First Greg for you I know you said that the performance of the stores across the region is pretty consistent, that\u2019s obviously encouraging to hear. Can you take down a little bit into that though? There\u2019s some fear out there about ag related markets? Can you talk about, so that they agree that you guys look at that, how those specific markets perform? Are you seeing any kind of stress in those markets? Gregory A. Sandfort: Hi Peter it\u2019s Greg. I will give you a brief comment, let Lee comment, as well. We are not seeing any real difference in the business in the upper Midwest and the Midwest, where you just mentioned a lot of these quote fears of the ag-business being difficult have occurred. Our business was very consistent across those regions, as well as it was in the south, the north and the west. So no we\u2019re not seeing any real impact. Lee do you have anything to say? Lee J. Downing: Peter up the Midwest the issue out there is Europe in the north, so you could imagine you got the most of the late spring season in that area and you also would have got a little more of the early winter season. So that kind of held that area up. So I agree with you Greg, I think, we had a good even keel across all regions including the Midwest. Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay thank you. And then as you talk about new store productivity, it looked good again. Just curious comment, I know you\u2019re pleased with what\u2019s going on so far in the west. But what kind of competitive response are you seeing from the competitors as you move into these markets, anything worth calling out? Gregory A. Sandfort: Peter we haven\u2019t seen anything out west that would indicate that they are really reacting. Their prices have kind of stayed where they are and we are entering the market. People seem to like where we are and where we would join the business. Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay great, last one for Tony. Just the decline in fuel cost or gas prices that we\u2019ve seen here in recent months, should we think of that as being a potential positive on the freight front going forward? Help us understand how it works through the P&L over the next few quarters. Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele: We definitely had a positive but it was not significant relative to the total transportation expense. We are optimistic that go forward, that it will prove to be a tail wind. But at the same time we are concerned that there will be some additional transportation cost that we\u2019re going to have to manage. But for the most part we believe that it can be served as a positive as we move forward. Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Magee with SunTrust. Unidentified Analyst :  Hey, guys, this is Linda in for David. Just in regard to the new stores out West, since they\u2019re a little bit larger, just how is the new store productivity performing out there? Is it in line with the company, a little bit higher? Anthony F. Crudele: This is Tony. Depending on how you measure the productivity, from a sales perspective they are much stronger sales stores than the average stores and we really like the volume that we get from the stores out West. Obviously, the expense structure is a little bit heavier as well, but net-net from a long-term return perspective, they are at or slightly above our normal approval rate. Unidentified Analyst : What about on the per foot basis? Would you say\u2026 Anthony F. Crudele: On a per foot basis, they are not significantly larger on a square foot basis. So the incremental sales, obviously, makes them more productive. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Is e-commerce growing at the rate you\u2019d expect? Gregory A. Sandfort: I\u2019ll answer that. This is Greg. Our e-commerce business is very robust right now. It\u2019s still very small and we have some more investment spending in the early part of 2015 to really get the platform where we\u2019d like it. And then we believe it will really start to accelerate. So it is running well ahead of the comps that the overall company is running, but it\u2019s still at a very small contribution rate, but we like what we see, all the enhancements we\u2019ve given. That pieces of business so far are working and we just have a few more things to dial-in. And then I think by the early part of next year, we\u2019re going to start to see this thing really start to ramp. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just lastly, how would you guys prefer winter to play out? What would be the best scenario? Anthony F. Crudele:  Well, I\u2019ll take that one. Certainly cooler weather really bodes well. You heard Greg talk a little bit about some early cool season weather impacting Q3. I will tell you credit to the team. We talked about getting products in early. We made some strategic investments in inventory and that\u2019s paid off for us. We\u2019d like to see it stay cool and quite frankly heating is a good business for us. We saw lot of wear in apparel. So I would say the colder the better. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS Securities : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So first, Tony, I wanted to follow-up on the comment you made towards the end of your remarks about making investments while still maintaining the mid-teens earnings growth. This year at the high end of the range, if you hit it, you are going to grow earnings maybe 13%. We could argue whether that\u2019s mid-teens or not, but the suggestion would be that this year would be an aberration out of the mid-teens earnings growth but even if you make a similar number of investments next year we should expect similar to better growth rate is that fair? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, I guess we could argue a little bit as to whether 13% was considered to be mid-teens but the comment represents that we know that we are a growth company, we know that to continue to grow we need to make investments in the business. We believe it that those investments have been included in our modeling. The last two years, we\u2019ve talked about the last two years being investment years. We think that now that it\u2019s sort of embedded in our model go forward that we can continue to grow the company in mid-teens and be able to continue to make those type of investments to build out our infrastructure. There just always seems to be concerns that every year is going to be an investment year and we need to chase something for earnings and we believe as we go forward that this already embedded in our modeling and that we can deliver our long term target. Having that said, as in the past we have always talked about growing the chain at 8% having some comp sales increase looking at 25 basis points of EBIT margin improvement with the share repurchase we think that we can get to the mid-teens well. Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS Securities : Okay. And my follow-up is on the gross margin, you outlined freight was up 23, mix was up 12, so without 35 basis points your gross margin was down 28, you should have seen a little bit of benefit from deflation you\u2019ve outlined all the factors that are margin driver that are, that they use continue to benefit from. So is there something else going on I know Greg mentioned that. Promotions were really part of the picture this quarter at least throughout most of the quarter. Is there something else going on? And then as part of that should we expect to see gross margin accelerate overtime as you build out more distribution centers and you\u2019re going to in turn lower the numbers 10 miles that that you have? Anthony F. Crudele: That clearly is one objective that we have as far as using the distribution network when it comes to the gross profit drivers, I try to highlight some of the larger impacts. When you look at all the variables involved in looking at gross profit, there is probably about 10 or 15 different levers. There\u2019s shrink. I think it was slightly down \u2013 well it\u2019s slightly up this period. There are special events that we have. There are vendor funded programs that have impacts. The marketing and the benefits of the programs that we have in place may impact margin in certain ways. So what we\u2019re trying to communicate relative to the marketing was that, we did not have significant numbers of programs out there that we\u2019re trying to buy the sales. We feel that it was a very normal year for us from a marketing standpoint. So when you look at some of the other factors, there were some other negatives that brought it down as an offset. But the two that I mentioned between mix and freight, those are the largest drives and we believe that that those go forward are sort of the key headwinds that we\u2019re going to be facing. So obviously with our initiatives to drive EBIT margin performance either through gross margin or SG&A leverage, we want to try to deliver that 25 basis points of improvement each year. Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS Securities : Okay that\u2019s helpful. Let me speak one last to you. Greg, there is a lot of discussion on the commodity price complex and grain prices and the potential impact that it could have on your customer base, that\u2019s probably anyone\u2019s guess and at least your performance would suggest that it\u2019s not have an impact, but does that have any impact on the way you\u2019re running the business? Are you thinking about changing up the product mix if corn stays at $3 to $4 a bushel for an extended period of time? Does that influence in any ways, the shape or manner in which you run the business? And I\u2019ll turn over from there. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: All right, Michael, I\u2019m going to let Steve to address this but I would tell you that it would not change the way that we run the mix of the business because we are a needs-based company. There are certain things our customers need, but I think Steve wanted to give some highlights on that. Steve K. Barbarick: Yes I\u2019ll tell you Michael, you can look at it being deflationary and yes there may be some top line headwinds, but we\u2019re still continuing to see unit growth. And for the way I sit back and I look at it is there\u2019s a lot of folks have an opportunity now to get into animal ownership where they may have not done so before. So whether it would be getting into bird feeding, when it comes to a lot of bird products that we sell on the seed side, whether it would be herd size. We\u2019ve seen a decline over time in herd size, you may see that come back. So I don\u2019t necessarily see deflation in some of these commodities as a bad thing. If anything it\u2019s putting money back into the pockets of folks that we\u2019re spending a lot more on it. So I think there\u2019s two different ways to look at that and I tend to look at it from that perspective. Operator : And as a reminder please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Yes, good afternoon guys. Gregory A. Sandfort: Hi, John. Anthony F. Crudele: Good afternoon, John. John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.:  Steve, just following on a mix issue, can you talk a little bit about you mentioned some of the positive surprises from the test or a good sell-through on the left hand side of the store. Can you tell us what really worked there and what you\u2019re excited about? Steve K. Barbarick: It\u2019s interesting John, we talk a little bit about deflation and overcoming some of the top line headwinds that that might cause and we experienced some of that in the last couple of quarters. The team did a really nice job looking out working with our store operations partners, we updated the plan-o-grams, we did a number of resets and not get into too much specifics but the departments where we have product in line every single department had a positive comp store sales performance and I have not seen that long time with Tractor Supply Company. The team has really worked hard. We work with the vendor partners, we switched out some product lines, I would tell you I feel very, very good about the strength of that side of the business. We just not need to keep the momentum going. John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.:  Great, thanks. And just another, you mentioned a little bit more on the mixing centers for next year, Greg can you comment a little bit more about the thought process on that and where we stand and what you\u2019re seeing out of that. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Yeah, the mixing center concept is really an attempt on our part to replenish the stores in a more rapid response methodology. Just I would call it on high bulk, high velocity low value product and it also take some steps out of us moving the product to distance from the manufacturer all the way to the DC and back to the stores. Mixing center system between all of that and deals with full palletized high velocity, high bulk products that we can push the stores daily every other day once a week \u2013 it really depends upon the need but to help cut down on stem miles at the same time though be able to pull inventory back out of the store from the standpoint that we were putting week to 10 days with the supply in the background of these types of products because we only have once or twice a week delivery. The mixing centers will help us push that inventory to those stores as they\u2019re selling it. So we think it will speed our term, we think overall will bring our inventory levels down over time and again keep us in better stock position. So we got two facilities that we will have operational in 2015. We\u2019re moving out of the back to the vehicle DC with the one facility and we\u2019ll be switching off another facility that will be a free stand post to that distribution network. And we\u2019re excited about the idea of it and we believe that it will serve us well but we tested the process and wake over the last year it worked, now we\u2019re going into two free stand units and see how that operates, if that works all will be thank, we\u2019ll take it out to more. John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Great, congrats. Good luck in the fall. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you, John. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research :  Good afternoon everyone. Nice quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research : Tony, could you just repeat one number before I ask my question. You said what private label or corporate brand was as a percent of sales. Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, I can give you that number. It was 30.7%. Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research : All right. Thank you. It sounds like most categories did well. Is there anything you\u2019d like to point out that was a little weak in terms of the merchandise categories? And what kind of headwind will it face this quarter? Anthony F. Crudele:  Overall like the regional performances, we saw pretty consistent strength across the board on the merchandizing side. I will say that we continue to face some headwinds when it comes to safes and storage. We saw that the last couple of quarters. We continue to see that in Q3. We\u2019re doing a lot to offset that, but that\u2019s where I would say some of the softness was. Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research : Okay. Any other retail R&D going on besides HomeTown Pet? Anthony F. Crudele:  Well, Chuck, we\u2019re always trying and testing new ideas, but I would say no. There\u2019s no other large scale thing in relative respect to what you heard from us about HomeTown Pet. But any given time you\u2019ll be in our stores and you\u2019ll see us testing 60 to 70 different ideas throughout the chain. So that\u2019s the test-and-learn mentality that we have. Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research : All right. Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele: Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan: Thanks, good evening. So a couple of questions. Can you talk about your thoughts on deflation next year and how that might proceed throughout the year? You\u2019re starting to lap the deflation in the fourth quarter here. Obviously, corn prices are way down. So any thoughts there would be very helpful. Anthony F. Crudele: Sure. Chris, this is Tony. When it comes to our estimates of deflation, we really do it sort of as a spot calculation and look as to where we are today and compare it to the upcoming quarters or the upcoming year. So I would prefer to push that calculation out until we come through to our next conference call and give the full year guidance. But in general terms, we do expect to experience some deflation next year. And as much as we do see some of the prices decreasing in some of the corn categories, we were hopeful that it will moderate somewhat over what we experienced this year. Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, understand. I mean the comparisons pretty much are straight lined over the next four quarters. And then there has been a lot of discussion in the investment community around the correlation to forming income line. I know you mentioned specifically that all regions comp in the mid single digit range, but can you talk about any evidence in either direction to support or refuse that argument? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes. This is Greg. The only evidence I can give you is our performance. It is totally inconsistent with what has been stated out there and I think it\u2019s overplayed, that form income has a direct correlation to our business. We can\u2019t see it. We\u2019ve been watching it for years, it has a slight if any impact. So I think our third quarter performance kind of stands out as a factor that would say that it is not anything that is co-related to our business. Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay understood. And then the last question is DC investments next year. Last year, you had a DC opening that caused some margin pressures. You have a couple of things going on in the west, in the northeast. So any thoughts there in terms of maybe how these DC openings compare to the one that you did in 2013? Thanks. Anthony F. Crudele:  Sure, Tony, again. Last year was a little bit different because last year\u2019s distribution center in the southeast was a relocation. So we incurred probably more cost than opening up a new one because we had a team, we had to relocate, we had some exit cost on the lease. And so there was more transitions cost required. Also as we move into next year and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t give specifics as to any numbers and what we are laughing this year versus next year but we obviously have the relocation of the store support center. As we move into the distribution center next year, what\u2019s different is we would expect to have a decrease in the stem miles and obviously have a benefit in transportation. And so the only thing that would hold us back next year that will be incremental would be the pre-opening related to the distribution center. Other than that, once it opened and it gets to full capacity, it\u2019s the transportation benefit should offset the additional cost. So we do expect to have some pre-opening related to that facility but again we believe that over the last two years we have incorporated those type of expenses into our operating model and continue to deliver our EPS target despite some of the additional infrastructure build that we\u2019ll have. Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan: Thanks very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hi, guys Scot Ciccarelli. Another follow up on the plan-o-grams and reset, can you give us a specific example of some changes you\u2019ve made. So if we can fair understand why customers had the positive reaction as they did, and could that lead to further reset in the store given the success of the initiative? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes, absolutely. First of all, we\u2019re always looking to do different resets and adjusting and modifying our product assortments based on customer demand and trend. But when you look at the left hand side I will use just I will give you just one example. We were looking at the performance of cargo management and we\u2019ve got an emphatic system and we talk a lot about the systems that we use today and how the refining done. And it suggested that our profitability per square foot wasn\u2019t real strong and so we looked across that what opportunities we might see and we see an opportunity for example winch set. So we reduced cargo management by four feet, added that four feet on to the winch program and we\u2019ve seen the numbers just exceed our expectations in a pretty significant way. You could take that bit of learning right there and apply that across a lot of different areas and we have done that on the left hand side. In addition to that I would tell you we have done a better job refining our assortments both locally like we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past and then we taken the inventory and replayed it back to markets where we think that there is more investment, where there is more demand. So again credit to the team working collaboratively as an organization, we really pulled off some nice things and it should give us a tailwind for another quarter or so. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s very helpful. And then just a follow-up. It\u2019s actually a balance sheet question, your payables inventory were actually up a bit this quarter. I\u2019ve always thought, given the leverage you guys should have with your vendors given how big you are in the space, that\u2019s something that could continue to rise overtime. I would think you\u2019ll able to take our working capital out overtime. Tony or Greg, can you just kind of give us your perspective on that? Thank a lot. Anthony F. Crudele: Sure, Scott. This is an area where we clearly would like to focus little bit more. We believe that as we work with our vendors that we look at the entire relationship and so when we look at the type of terms that we are going to get as far as sort of finance inventory versus the cost of the goods and the other programs that they work with us on. It\u2019s been an area where we believe that we come up with sort of the best working relationship with the vendors. Having said that, it\u2019s definitely as we move forward it\u2019s an area that we will continue to focus on as far as driving that. Over the last couple of years, we have used our financing ability to provide anticipation for our vendors when they needed to cash infusions and so we\u2019ve utilized that. So generally as we came out of the recession, that\u2019s one of the reasons why that number sort of had continued to drop down, but as businesses improved, obviously it\u2019s an area that we will take a hard look at. Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Hi, guys, this is actually Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Congratulations on the quarter. I just have a couple of questions. Could you please contextualize the cost or CapEx implications for the new DC next year? Anthony F. Crudele: As far as the capital around the DC, is that question? We\u2019ve targeted about $70 million to $75 million for the facility. It will be a little bit larger than some of our other facilities, obviously due to the span and the number of stores that we anticipate that it will serve. Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. And you guys talked about strengths that you saw in big ticket items. Could you please frame this trend versus what it has been in the last five years? I mean, is this a particularly stand out period or was this cyclically driven? And do you think this is sustainable going forward? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes. As far as the big ticket items, what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years is that our customer is really need based. And so, it has been very difficult for us to read relative to the big ticket. For example, included in our big ticket is gun safes. Over the last two years there\u2019s been significant activity around that. There were some cyclical business like our riding lawn mower business. That\u2019s been somewhat stagnated down over the last seven years, but we\u2019ve seen some fairly positive activity this year. So it\u2019s very difficult to judge whether it\u2019s cyclical or it\u2019s just sort of need based, or if it\u2019s economy based and people are just feeling a little bit better and feel that they have the opportunity to go out and spend on some of the larger items. So at this point in time, we\u2019re still not willing to commit that big ticketed fact that people are will to spend right now. But it is something that we\u2019re watching and we did like what we saw as we moved through the quarter and in some of the larger ticket sales, like running lawn movers, some of the power equipment, heating and items like log splitters. Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. And one final quick question. I know this has been talked about already. But if you could just contextualize the implications of the recent commodity price declines for inflation or deflation going forward, and in terms of its margins? And what would it do so based on the \u2013 where do you see the impact from this current commodity price action on a go forward basis? Gregory A. Sandfort:  We had talked about it just recently on another question. We tend to really try to wake and do it more on a quarter-by-quarter basis because the prices do tend to move. So I prefer to provide more specific guidance and so we give our full year guidance on the January conference call. But generally speaking, we believe that there will be some deflation next year. We expected to hopefully moderate from what we saw this year which was approximately 90 basis points to 100 basis points of impact. When do have deflation, it obviously hurts the top line, but at the same time it generally will benefit gross margin rate. So we can have a little pickup there. And again, it is our position as a management team that we are expected to manage deflation and inflation as we moved through \u2013 as we continue to manage the business in sales and margin. Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Perfect, thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Good results. You mentioned, Greg, last quarter that you would be less promotional in the third quarter and its sounds like the business stay true to that. Last quarter traffic was not as good and I think some of the promos were to get people in or spend a little more. This quarter the traffic seem better, the weather was more seasonal. So, I don\u2019t know is there any second thoughts on whether you putting promos on to better traffic environments would have even gotten a better result and I have a follow-up for Tony. Gregory A. Sandfort: I would tell you Simeon that our customers are need based and we are a destination store. We knew that as the weather would improve and it always does it\u2019s just a matter of timing. We have the tale of two stories here in the third quarter. We had a continuation of spring summer, which we were able to chase and the merchants did a wonderful job of pulling product into that and feed that trend. And at the same time, in the Northern part of the country, we start seeing really stronger action to the early selling and heating another fall type product as Tony has mentioned. So when we start seeing those two kind of collide, there is no reason to step up the promotional base. And as a matter of fact, we only run 15, 16 rotations a year. We like that strategy. We don\u2019t want to call up in a strategy longer-term of thing. It\u2019s got to be a coupon to buy something attractive. I got to wait for the next ad and so on and so forth. And that\u2019s what a lot of the people we compete would do. And that\u2019s just not our business models. So no I don\u2019t think we would have driven any more business really to any great extent by laying on more promotion. Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley : And you mentioned you avoided doing any major promotions and I think it sounds like also the lesson learned from last quarter is that something that we\u2019re not going to see repeated weather it\u2019s a few quarters down the road or a couple of years down the road is that fair? Gregory A. Sandfort: I think that\u2019s fair, but I would also tell you that if we were starting to see foot traffic slow that would be a different story, but we continue to see good solid foot traffic and that\u2019s an indicator for us that, we still got customers coming through the front doors and as long as that stay solid we\u2019re going to stick with our plans. Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then my follow-up on the guidance for comp and not to get too cute with the guidance, but I think the implies for the year backs you into the fourth quarter anywhere between \u2013 slightly positive to somewhere six to maybe a midpoint of three and I think that\u2019s just a plain math, but the lower end of that would seem overly conservative for you based on history. So is there purpose behind keeping it that wide, extra weather or is that just simple conservatism? Gregory A. Sandfort: When we set the guidance it is sort of difficult. The one area where we have the three different sales \u2013 comp sales and the earnings. On a full year basis, the comp guidance is a little bit wide. We just felt that we didn\u2019t want to try to narrow it specifically, but we assume that you all will sort of work up of what you think the reasonable comp is given the context around the directions that we\u2019ve given you for the fourth quarter and sort of come up with reason a reasonable comp. We did state that we believe that het comp will be at the higher end of the range. And so that in our mind sort of put you somewhere between 3.3 and 3.8 for the full year. So somewhere in that area and then obviously whatever the math works out to get into that range. So we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s relatively conservative and I don\u2019t believe if you do the math, you come out to 3 for the quarter. Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley : That\u2019s helpful. One more to sneak in back for Greg. I know you mentioned the hometown store and that sounds like you don\u2019t want to answer a whole lot of questions on them, but I\u2019ll try one. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Okay Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Franklin and Fairview, I mean we can look at the demographics from the internet here, anything specific about those towns to tell you about at least geographically, what you\u2019re thinking about the strategy? I mean is it going to be more of a rural concept the way the Tractor is or are you thinking more suburban? Gregory A. Sandfort: Well, you\u2019re correct on the location selection. It was done purposely. The Franklin location sits equidistant between two Tractor stores that sit in rural environments, maybe a little bit more on the edge of suburbia and the unit that sits out in Fairview sits only a quarter of mile away in the rural environment from a current Tractor. So this is going to give us pretty good read of the type of customers that we will attract to this store format. Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay thanks and good luck. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, this is Gary. I\u2019ll ask only one question unlike Simeon and everybody else, who asked three. First of all, congratulations on a great quarter. That doesn\u2019t count as a question. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thanks, Gary. Thank you, Gary. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : The question is, if you look back over the last few years to or specifically some of the feed categories have been by far your strongest areas, which will be growing significantly in that area including hay. What are you seeing competitively, like whether it\u2019s Rural King or Horseshine or Mills? Are any of these companies starting to expand their fees offerings to try to compete more directly with CUE? What have you seen in that regard? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick:  Yes. This is Steve. They are all formidable competitors. I mean they do a very nice job with their assortments. They recognize there is need in the marketplace. We\u2019ve got as Greg mentioned we\u2019ll be in 49 states or shortly. We continue to see momentum in Q, we\u2019re growing our units, we think we\u2019re picking up share, we\u2019ve talked a lot about independence as well and we\u2019re picking up some of that share. So I would tell you in general the market I think we\u2019re out in front of the marketplace. I think we\u2019re continuing to grow and expand what we\u2019re doing in this area. And really the focus for us in Q is three key things. We\u2019re constantly looking at refining our assortments. Two, we\u2019re making strategic investments that we\u2019re better in stock and we\u2019re a better dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs. And three, we\u2019ve done a really nice job using our price optimization system, so we\u2019re right and we\u2019ll price locally making sure that we\u2019re taking care those customers. So we think that there is continued growth here using those free tactics. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : You haven\u2019t seen the other, more direct competitors change their mix at all to try to do what you\u2019re doing given your strength? Steve K. Barbarick:  I would tell you there is a lot of folks out there that are doing a lot of different things. And we try to stay focused on what we\u2019re doing rather than chasing a lot of the competitors. I would tell you that by copying if that\u2019s the case and that\u2019s the way they want to go, that\u2019s a fine forms of flattery but we\u2019re continuing to pickup share. We\u2019re going to stay true to what we\u2019re focused on. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Steve K. Barbarick: Thank you, Gary. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thank you very much. Greg with respect to the two HomeTown Pet stores, can you just give a little bit more color on the impetus for testing those concepts now. And more importantly, what is that speak to your convection level of your core concept as well as the smaller format. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: I only give you this Alan that we have a very robust pet business in general in the company and we believe that we can do more pet business. But we don\u2019t want to distort the interior of the Tractor Supply format, because it\u2019s many stores with inside a store. And that format works well. It continues to perform well. So our thought process was if we believe we\u2019re owed more pet business, how would we go about maybe achieving that and how do we understand how to grow, still grow the pet business inside of Tractor. Are there are pieces and parts that maybe we\u2019re missing that we don\u2019t understand. So that was the impetus of putting these two test concepts out there. Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Do you still believe that you can have the same number 2,200, 2,300 of the core concept? Gregory A. Sandfort: Absolutely, without question. Anthony F. Crudele:  One correction there. We feel that\u2019s 2,100 right now. So we\u2019re very confident in that number. We\u2019ll obviously continue to look at sites up over and above that, but right now we feel that 2,100, we\u2019re very confident with that number. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Nice quarter guys. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Thank you. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : My first question is just around your customers. You guys have pretty good information on your customers now. You\u2019re stuck with them in a few different categories. Do you have any sense of how they\u2019ve been reacting to various macro and farm income forces over the last few quarters? Has there been any difference in trends? Gregory A. Sandfort: I\u2019ll try to answer that. What I can tell you is this, that they continue to buy the way they\u2019ve been buying for the last three to four years. They\u2019re credit averse. They\u2019re paying with cash and with debit about the same rate as they have been. They continue to repair and not replace, although, we did see a little bit of movement this year because of the elongated spring/summer season. And there is some big ticket transactions that I would say, were new units in outdoor power equipment. But though, they\u2019re very consistent and that\u2019s what we like about this customer base, they\u2019re fairly predictable. And they have not shown us any indication that they want to take on any type of short-term debt to do something out of the ordinary. So, no, very consistent performance, very persistent behavior. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Got you. So no major differences in rate of sales contribution from the hog farmers or production farmers or lifestylers or anything like that? Gregory A. Sandfort: No. Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities : Okay. And my follow-up is just around, thinking about the fourth quarter, given the favorable weather trends in September, in particular, you had good cold weather year oriented sales. Do you feel like you may have pulled forward some sales from the fourth quarter? Gregory A. Sandfort: I\u2019ll answer that question. At this point, we don\u2019t anticipate that. Like I mentioned, we do like cold weather and while October temperatures are what they are, November and December are very important months for us. Unidentified Analyst : Very good. Thank you very much Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter. Lee J. Downing: Thank you, Denise. Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, so you said all the regions were comping mid-single-digit, but I think that going into the quarter, you had expected that in the Northeast and the upper Midwest the delayed on-set of summer would lead to some demand destruction, because of the very short and a gardening season? Looking at categories in those markets, did you actually see that? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes, I would tell you up north, we\u2019d talked about the extended season, our ag products performance, lawn and garden and everything did pretty well. And that\u2019s comping the prior year where we had a very strong Q3. So year-over-year we a saw nice consistent growth. Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks. And in term SG&A leverage, you said that which was much better than we had expected. So is that about one-third of that was coming from incentive comp, was the rest from just the higher comp, or were there some other factors? Anthony F. Crudele: Denise this is Tony. As we\u2019ve moved into the back half of the year coming off Q2 we were very focused on managing the SG&A. So we believe that we are aggressive when it came to the expense control and that combined with the strong comp sales really gave us that significant leverage. And then one key thing that I had mentioned on the prepared remarks was that, in Q2 medical and workers\u2019 comp were very high and they moderated, so that gave us some additional leverage, as well. Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, got it thanks. And just lastly to kind of go back to this, I guess nearly dead horse. Actually how much have feed costs declined, because we\u2019ve talked about deflation and very broad terms in terms of your total comp. But how much of feed gone down because I\u2019m just wondering for the person whose got a couple of horses, what are they saving because it just doesn\u2019t seem just clear with these strength and big ticket, for example, on small agricultural equipment like mowers that you were talking about. Anthony F. Crudele: Just give you indication, we always corn and sort of the main factor is the component in the feed category. And year-over-year it was around $4.50 last year were down to little bit below $3.50 this year. So you can see that there was a significant impact on a year-over-year basis. But directionally this actually give you an idea of the impact. Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC : Hi, good afternoon or good evening at this point. I appreciate the color that the weather helped the business, not just talking about when it\u2019s negative. Is there way to estimate what that benefit was in the period as drought like conditions fell further year-on-year? And I think Tony your guidance for 4Q looks like about a four comp. So would that be sort of taking a ex-weather benefit run rate of around four in the third quarter and continuing it on or what\u2019s the weather impact bigger than that? Gregory A. Sandfort: Mark, it\u2019s definitely difficult to make that assessment. We do look at some of the spring categories what the lift was overall, but the other complexity when you get into some of the cold winter products, selling log splitters in August, it seems to be counterintuitive. And so between the extended and the winter, I would say it would be on an injustice to try to quantify exactly what the weather impact was. As we move forward, we look at the weather as having a nice cold wintery December, but we believe there is opportunity \u2013 when last year it was a cold wintery December. This year as we move forward, we believe there\u2019s some opportunity in October and November with a potentially cooler October, November. But generally as we move into the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that people will recant last year\u2019s harsh winter and get out and do a little shopping earlier in the quarter. Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC : Okay. And then can you just share with us your updated thoughts for store growth a little bit longer-term. You did mention that 8% footage or store growth. I thought there was some consideration being given to potentially going to a constant number of openings per store. Is that something you\u2019re reflecting on? Or do you think you can continue to drive the 8% over a number of years? Gregory A. Sandfort: Currently, our position is the 8% growth and we will take a look at growth on an annual basis and make determination as to what we believe is the most beneficial for the company and for the shareholder. So we\u2019ll take a look that as we sort of cycle into the New Year and potentially we can address that as we move into the Analyst Day. Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC : Okay, thanks a lot. Anthony F. Crudele: Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Hi, good evening. Anthony F. Crudele: Hi, Brian. Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Congrats on very nice quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele: Thank you. Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I just have a couple of quick questions here, since towards the end of the queue. But first on the SG&A expense, and Tony you spoke about this a bit in your prepared remarks. We saw a nice leverage, actually I guess reduced SG&A growth here in the quarter. You look at that 80 basis points in leverage. How much of that you think reflected more or less one-time benefits here that we should probably not expect as we go into Q4, or even into 2015? Gregory A. Sandfort: Well, the first thing that I would generally carve out and it\u2019s a little bit difficult to predict is really the incentive compensation. So right off the bat, I\u2019d say carve out the one-third and then look at the comp and the comp increase. When we look at our leverage points, depending on the quarter you can range from usually about 3% to potentially 4%. So that could be an indication that as we get above 3% on a comp, you\u2019re going to start to see some more leverage. And the main driver will be the sales comp. We will be able to manage some of the expenses and I think we\u2019ve done a good job in the back half, but, again, being a growth company we will continue to grow the SG&A and our goal is to do it at a lesser amount than we grow our sales base. Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.:  That\u2019s very helpful. And then a follow-up question, again, which is a quick one, and I apologize if you already addressed this, but you\u2019ve taken your CapEx guidance down and there hasn\u2019t been a real adjustment to store openings. What\u2019s the reason behind that? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes, I had stated in the prepared remarks, some of the larger initiatives, and now we have a little bit more visibility on, have been pushed out during the course of the year. Specifically, the Southwest Distribution Center, we expected to have some capital expenditures this year and we do project to still have a few in the fourth quarter, and particular, some land purchase. We also expected to have additional lease space for our Northeast facility. We have identified some space very close to our current distribution center in Hagerstown and we expected some additional expense related to that, and some capital as well. So those projects got push back. And then, we usually maintain some CapEx dollars for the potential purchase of some of our lease stores in acquiring those properties, but we do not anticipate doing any this year in actuality. So that was a significant saving. So what I would reiterate and I think that is important, as we move forward into next year we have set a goal that we do not want to exceed CapEx of $250 million a year. So even with a portion of these projects being pushed into 2015 we will still maintain our CapEx at no higher than $250 million for 2015. Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thank you very much. Congrats again. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele: Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Hi, Greg, just a quick question about HomeTown Pet, if the two test stores are proved to be successful? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes. Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Would it ideally become a growth platform, a new growth platform for Tractor Supply or is that to convince some of the channel exclusive brands that currently are not selling the Tractor that you could responsibly and effectively carry those brands in your full line stores and therefore not need to rollout the HomeTown Pet? Gregory A. Sandfort: As I stated before Dan, hometown is a test of two stores. You hit on it that there is going to be some mix of products in those stores that we currently do not carry in Tractor. And we\u2019ve got some learning here between these two locations. So I think that\u2019s about as much as I\u2019m willing to tell you at this point. We haven\u2019t got the first store opened yet and that\u2019s going to be in a couple weeks and there will be more to talk about some time in other part of next year I think. Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, great thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes, hi, good afternoon guys. I will add my congratulations as well. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the mixing centers. I think this is a very important development especially given the growth in Q. If you could maybe tell us just a little bit more how sort of the size of these things the CapEx requirements relative to a DC, how quickly you can get them open? And then how that might change your views on growing the distribution sort of a capacity in networks going forward? Gregory A. Sandfort: Well, I\u2019m I\u2019ll give you what I\u2019m comfortable to tell you, how about that? Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Sounds great. Gregory A. Sandfort: And that is that this is not going to displace distribution centers, but what it actually does is it allows us to improve our ability to service stores and also to take some pressure off of the supply chain. We\u2019ll have two operations opening in the South next spring. Average CapEx is about $8 million. We like to look at these as lease facilities first and build purchase facilities second. There in the way between 50,000 to 70,000 square feet. Think of it as an elongated age, a lot of doors on both sides where product comes in one side is quickly moved and sorted and pushed across in the trucks on the other side of the building. And this is kind of a rapid response methodology in a way. So what we\u2019ll do long-term, long-term it helps us to move high velocity, high bulk, low value product more cost effectively, that\u2019s the bottom line. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then given just sort of at least first or second, if you saw these two really help drive productivity, how quickly would you be able to ramp this going forward? Gregory A. Sandfort: Great question. I don\u2019t have a direct answer for you on that. It will be a combination of \u2013 we\u2019ve already gotten some target markets where we believe if this works well we would go, but we have not worked on any additional leases or properties at this point. Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is [Cody Ross] (ph) filling in for Aram. Quick question and I\u2019ll make it brief. You had previously called out that localization of products is a big focus especially out West where the stores are farther apart. Can you just provide an update on that front? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick:  Yes, absolutely. This is Steve. We\u2019re making great strides out there. I would tell you that the stores out in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada have different assortments than what you are going to find out East. Even the store Utah that we\u2019re going to open will be carrying beekeeping supplies. And yes, you\u2019ve heard me right, that is beekeeping supplies. We went out there, we research the market and we saw in a lot of our competitors and thought, well, we better put our best put forward out there when we move out there. So you are going to see a lot of localized products. We\u2019re continuing to refine what we are doing. We have ongoing conference calls with our store operators out there, because they are really leading us down the path of what those customers are asking for and we\u2019re tweaking our assortments as we move forward. Unidentified Analyst : And that was in Utah you said you have the beekeeping supplies? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes. Yes, that\u2019s accurate. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Steve K. Barbarick:  And what\u2019s interesting about that is, you\u2019ve picked up, you\u2019ve learned little things here and there, and then you find over time that there may be more opportunities in other existing stores. So again these are all test-and-learn type formats in product categories, and we\u2019ll see how they do. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask I know it\u2019s still very small, but like with online purchases, are you seeing any different behavior like or what people buying online is it different, is it like skew towards more consumable or more big ticket or anything. Are you also seeing more pickup in store or desire to pickup in store than just a delivery? I was curious to just initial earnings that you are finding. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Joe, this is Greg. What we are finding is that our customers are looking for products either in what I would consider to be not standard in a typical tractor, but in other words, a long tail aspect SKUs that maybe with all Korean tractor, but are available online. And a category of product that we have to keep more narrow because of the store we want to get X amount of space. But we\u2019re seeing people do that. I\u2019ll give you an example in our business with portable buildings. We have an assortment inside the store for that, but online we have just elongated broad a long, long tail and they\u2019re buying out of the long tail. Larger buildings, different size buildings, custom buildings, and so on. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing a lot in our online business. There are some customers that are buying some dog food products that we sell in the stores, I\u2019m not going to tell you they\u2019re not, they\u2019re doing it for convenience. But its primarily the things that would be out of the long tail that you wouldn\u2019t find in our store. Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group :  Got it, that\u2019s helpful thanks. And one more and I apologize if I missed it before. But did you guys address we always ask about where you might stand with an affinity type of program. I know you\u2019ve been testing some different things I just wanted to get an update there. Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, I\u2019ll go and take that, this is Steve. We brought on our director of customer marketing earlier this year because we felt like we needed to add to our expertise. He\u2019s come in, he\u2019s been a lot of very interesting things, his targeted e-mail and made us more relevant we\u2019re getting better click through rates and page opening rates. When it comes to affinity we\u2019ve had a number of cross functional meetings, we\u2019re right now in the process of building some business requirements for it. But you won\u2019t see anything as far as a pilot until a very back half of 2015 and even then it will be just a test. Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group :  Got it that\u2019s helpful thanks and good luck with this fourth quarter. Steve K. Barbarick: Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners. Mark K. Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC: Hi, question about plan-o-grams, based on one of your answers during Q&A its sounds like you have one more quarter of the big benefit from the plan-o-gram research. So I just want to make sure that\u2019s accurate. But then, if that\u2019s true, have you cycled through the entire square footage of the store but with the new plan-o-gram center I would assume it\u2019s fair to assume you can take that to another higher meaningful level of the effectiveness. I just want to make sure I\u2019m interpreting that all correct. Gregory A. Sandfort:  Yes, for the most part you are. I mean I may have misspoken when I just said one quarter and I don\u2019t want to over build it. I would say that we had a very solid Q3, we saw performance we hadn\u2019t seen in the past. You would anticipate that to continue forward, but again things can change, customer habits can change. I feel very good about the progress we made on that side of the store. The new plan-o-gram center will allow us to be more effective looking at. So I would say we\u2019re constantly in a test-and-learn mode and that\u2019s where, I\u2019ll leave it. Mark K. Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC: Okay, thank you. Operator :  And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : I just got one follow-up question, which is distribution related. Is there way to quantify the impact of sort of an ideal distribution network when you roll out the new facility in the Southwest and the West and the expansion in Northeast? Obviously there\u2019s a tradeoff between the CapEx and P&L, but do you think that the benefit to gross margin is in the tens of basis points or on lower stem miles or potentially a lot better than that? Anthony F. Crudele:  When we look at it, we look at the distribution network or a distribution center as we build them at full capacity. The cost of the building will net against the transportation cost. So we look at them generally as neutral and depending on when we eventually push to two to three shifts, we do expect some benefit that would outweigh the cost. So from a modeling perspective, I would tend to show the increase in SG&A with a comparable offset in gross margin transportation. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And I guess, just as a follow-up to that. After you have these new facilities that you\u2019ve discussed up and running, how many units \u2013 what\u2019s your total capacity in terms of the number of the units you can serve post these new facilities? Gregory A. Sandfort:  Relative to the distribution centers, our long-term plan is obviously 2015 do a facility in the Southwest. And we target about two years after that looking at the Northwest. And then, eventually depending on the capacity, the added capacity from the additional leased space in the Northeast, we\u2019ll eventually be looking at the Northeast as well. So once we\u2019re there we would expect that we would be able to exceed the 2,100 that we currently have. We anticipate that from a distribution center capacity we would be able to exceed that number as well as have some additional capacity through the mixing center network as well. Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Brent Rystrom from Feltl. Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : Thank you, and good morning. A quick couple of thoughts for you. I was thinking about all the questions on the farm economy. And so as an observation as somebody who is a farmer and lives in the Midwest, the 2012 crop, which was the drought crop that became so valuable, was worth about $64 billon, the corn drop. And from a simplistic perspective as production rebounded in 2013, the value of the realized value of that crop was about $54 billion. When you look at the futures curve right now and you look at the projections for yields, it looks like the current crop is valued at about $53 billion. It would seem to me that if there is indeed a risk or an impact from the slowing farm economy, it would have hit you on the $64 billion to $54 billion drop, not the $54 billion to $53 billion. Does that make sense? Gregory A. Sandfort: It definitely makes sense. Again, we don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s that direct correlation and I can appreciate taking\u2026 Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : I understand that but everybody seems to be fixated on this and from a simplistic perspective\u2026 Gregory A. Sandfort: It would have already come, is what you\u2019re saying... Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : Yes. Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes. Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : And so if it even is an impact, wouldn\u2019t it have implied to you that the impact was in the second half of 2013 and the first half of 2014, when those prices that dropped has realized at that point, which coincidentally coincided with some very supportive comps for you guys? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes\u2026 Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : Whether it was related or not, it happened already\u2026 Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes\u2026 Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : And right now it doesn\u2019t look like there is pricing in any significant change the current crop, which started getting harvest right now compared to last year\u2019s. So I just want to say that seems reasonable, right? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes. Anthony F. Crudele:  Yes. Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : All right. Then I was at the Industrial Pellet Association Conference in Miami earlier this month and there were dozens of small retailers from New England and the Midwest there. And all of them saying that they\u2019re having a very difficult time finding wood pellets for this season and you guys were cited as a reason, which I view as a positive for you, in that as you guys grow your business in the wood pellet business and as a couple of your other big box competitors do as well, it\u2019s getting more difficult for the smaller players to buy wood pellets, particularly as the export market for wood pellets heats up. You guys appear to be really, really well positioned for this. I\u2019m just sensing this could be a very big opportunity this fall in the wood pellet business for you guys seasonally. Would you care to comment on that? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, this is Steve. I would tell you that heating a big business for us. We did make some strategic investments across all lines of heating and I think we\u2019re well positioned as we go into November, December. Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company : Thanks, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you, Brent. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Skold, I would like to turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort:  This is Greg. Let me just close by saying thank you all for your interest and support of Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking to all of you again on our fourth quarter performance in January of 2015 and this will end the call. Operator : This now concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Sandfort: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and CFO; Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and our full year results. Comp store sales for the quarter increased 5.3% versus an increase of 3.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The comp increase was driven by increases in both traffic and ticket, and we continued to see strength across all our major merchandize categories and geographic regions. The fourth quarter was our 21st consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales and our 27th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. For the fourth quarter, we made early strategic investments in a number of key categories such as heating, cold weather apparel and footwear and outdoor power equipment anticipating that the customer would purchase earlier than the year before. These investments positioned us well to capitalize on early consumer buying trends, driven by colder weather early in the quarter. We also strengthened our commitment to seasonal C.U.E. items and achieved a solid performance within this group of products, which also added to our comparable sales for the quarter. In the quarter, we started the rollout of our new demand planning system to the first few departments, and as we methodically rolled the system out across all our merchandize categories, this system will more accurately forecast the sales and seasonality of products that we carry within our assortments. During the fourth quarter, we also opened our first Tractor Supply store in Utah, which was the 49th state for Tractor Supply. We also converted our first Del\u2019s store over to the Tractor Supply format and nameplate in the state of Washington. We are excited about the opportunity to grow our market share in Washington as we continue to convert the remaining Del\u2019s stores to new TSC stores in that market. We continue to develop our omni-channel with improvements to content and product availability online as well as additions to our drop ship vendor ecommerce programs. We\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in visits to our Web site now that we\u2019ve added our mobile site capability, and although online sales are not material at this point, we have seen a significant increase in the store locator feature and believe our online and mobile sites are driving footsteps into our stores. Now regarding our supply chain. We purchased land and have started construction on our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. This distribution center is an important part of our Western expansion strategy. Not only will it support our continued growth in those markets, it should lower our transportation costs and improve delivery times to our stores in that region. The new facility is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2015 and will have the potential to ultimately serve in upwards of 250 stores in the Southwest region. In 2015, we also plan to open two mixing centers in our Texas region. These are smaller cross-docking style distribution facilities that handle many of our palletized products and faster turning C.U.E. items such as [feed] [ph], shavings and wood pellets. With our vendors delivering products directly to these mixing centers, which are located closer to our stores, we can shorten our supply chain stem miles and reduce in-store inventory levels through more frequent store deliveries. As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in the analytic tools and supply chain assets necessary to strategically drive our growth. Our priorities in 2015 include opening approximately 110 to 115 new Tractor Supply stores, opening our new Southwest distribution center and Northeast D.C. expansion, the addition of two mixing centers in our Texas region, continued growth in the state of Washington through our Del\u2019s conversion to Tractor Supply stores, system enhancements to increase scalability and analytic capability for inventory allocation, omni-channel engagement and CRM, and continued system security enhancements. As we all know, the cold harsh start to the year and the late spring selling season required us to carefully manage seasonal inventory investments and monitor our product sell-throughs. We had to react swiftly and we\u2019re successful in meeting the seasonal and everyday needs of our customers in both the first and second halves of the year. Throughout the year, the team did an excellent job of managing product flow and adjusting merchandize assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demands in the markets that we serve. We believe this continues to be a core competency and strategic advantage for Tractor Supply Company. In my closing comments, I\u2019d just like to say thank you to all of our hardworking and dedicated team members who serve our customers each and every day out there. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and our finish to the year. While it is difficult to predict the timing of seasonal demand trends, we know our customers do depend on us for everyday basic items and we continue to stay focused on being the most dependable supplier of their lifestyle. Our business is more than just transactional. It is building long-term trusted relationships with our customers and having what they need, when they need no matter what the season or weather. We appreciate your time today and I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on the financials and our initial look for 2015. Tony? Anthony F. Crudele: Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 27, 2014 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12% to 1.58 billion and net income grew 16.9% to 112.1 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Comp store sales increased 5.3% in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 3.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 27th consecutive quarter gaining 3% on top of a 5.1% increase last year. We are very pleased with our ability to continue driving increased foot traffic through our doors by meeting the everyday needs of our customers. Strong winter seasonal business and C.U.E. items were key traffic drivers in the quarter. Average comp ticket increased by 2.3% versus last year\u2019s 1.5% decrease. The increase was driven by the mix of goods and the strength of big ticket sales partially offset by deflation. A few key points about the quarter. Sales were strongest in the first half of the quarter coming off a very cold winter last year and with the advent of the cool temperatures in October and November, our customer anticipated another cold winter and started buying winter seasonal items earlier. We believe that this shifted much of the winter seasonal sales to earlier in the fourth quarter versus last year. Big ticket had a comp sales increase greater than the company average and positively impacted overall comp sales by an estimated 64 basis points. Strength in our seasonal category such as heating and outdoor power equipment drove the big ticket comp sales increase and more than offset the continued headwind in the safe category. Solid comp sales were widespread and not limited to any particular region as both the north and the south did well. Deflation was slightly less than we expected and we estimate that it was approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. Sales of direct import items increased 14% versus Q4 last year and represented 16% of the sales mix in the quarter. Sales of exclusive branded products were also very strong in the quarter increasing 11.4% and represented 29.4% of total sales. Turning now to gross margin, which increased approximately 16 basis points to 34%, our initial direct margin continues to improve as a result of our initiatives around price optimization, markdown management and strategic sourcing. Favorable colder weather provided strong sell-through of our seasonal winter products resulting in favorable markdown management, accompanied with strong price management on some key winter seasonal products. Deflation also had a positive impact on gross margin. Partially offsetting the benefits from our margin enhancing initiatives with freight, which increased approximately 20 basis points due to higher transportation costs primarily from the increase in stem miles to the new Western store base. This impact was much greater than the benefit we received from lower fuel costs in the quarter. The overall product mix impact was not significant this quarter. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 22.8% of sales compared to 23.5% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. We are pleased with our expense control in the quarter, which coupled with strong comp sales, provided significant leverage. Strong expense control of store payroll, occupancy and marketing netted almost half of the favorable leverage. Incentive compensation accounted for the other half of the leverage benefit in the quarter. Our effective income tax rate increased to 36.7% in Q4 compared to 35% last year. The increase was due principally to the reversal of certain FIN 48 reserves last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with 51.1 million in cash compared to 142.7 million last year with no debt in both years. Our stock repurchase program was very effective in the early part of the fourth quarter as we acquired approximately 868,000 shares for 51.1 million or an average $62.35 per share price. Average inventory levels per store at year end increased approximately 4% compared to last year. We ended last year very light in inventory as a result of the strong sell-through in the fourth quarter. We believe that we are in better inventory position this year to take advantage of the January and February winter business. Inventory turns for the year improved 3 basis points to 3.32 times and we are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter and the full year. Capital expenditures for the year were 160.6 million as compared to 218.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed one store in the fourth quarter compared to 31 stores opened in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, we opened 107 stores and closed one. The decrease in capital expenditures relates to cycling expenditures for the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year. We were significantly favorable to our CapEx forecast as our land cost and construction draws for the Southwest distribution facility were below our estimate, the Northeast distribution center expansion was deferred to Q1 2015 and certain IT initiatives were under budget or reprioritized. Now turning our attention to 2015. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to fund our ongoing operational initiatives such as logistics, merchandizing systems and omni-channel to position the company for future growth and at the same time manage the business to deliver our target of mid-teens EPS growth. We expect full year sales to range from 6.2 billion to 6.3 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to increase 2.5% to 4%. We are targeting EBIT margins to be flat to 10 basis points of improvement compared to 2014. We expect a modest improvement in gross margin and SG&A leverage will be dependent on the sales level achieved. We anticipate net income to range from approximately 403 million to 417 million or $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share. We expect to open 110 to 115 new stores with approximately 55% to 60% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. As Greg mentioned, we will begin to transition Del\u2019s stores to Tractor Supply markets and we expect to close seven Del\u2019s stores as we backfill Washington State. We forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 37%, which is consistent with last year\u2019s rate of 36.9%. We are initially targeting 240 million to 250 million of capital expenditures in 2015 consistent with our four-year CapEx plan. The increase over last year results from the new store openings, the completion of our Southwest distribution center, our expansion plan for the Northeast distribution center and the execution of other key initiatives. We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We have reduced our year-end targeted cash balance to 0 to 50 million. Consistent with this past year, we expect to have seasonal borrowings at the end of the first and third quarters. For modeling purposes, we estimate that the diluted shares outstanding inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity will be between 137 million and 136 million for the full year. So let me discuss some of the assumptions that help us form our projection for 2015. Based on current consumer confidence polls and buoyed by lower gas prices, we believe that the consumer is more optimistic. As a retailer that serves our customers everyday basic needs, we believe there is potential for upside but we also recognize that we tend to receive less of a tailwind in those retailers that are more dependent on discretionary purchases. Deflation was a top line headwind last year and averaged approximately 85 basis points. This year, we expect deflation to continue to be a headwind and average approximately 50 basis points ranging between 10 to 100 basis points during the year. We anticipate the impact will be higher than the first half of the year and moderating downward in the second half of the year. As we have previously discussed, it is our responsibility to manage through deflationary and inflationary periods and we believe we have demonstrated that ability in the past. There were some positive and negative weather events that impacted the timing of sales in 2014. This was the second year in a row that we had a late spring and an extended spring/summer that progressed late into the third quarter and favorable cold trends in the fourth quarter. We believe it was a net neutral year from a weather perspective. As we have stated in the past, we generally benefit from an early spring, therefore, if the weather pattern returns closer to normal, we would anticipate slightly stronger comp sales improvement in the first half of the year and in the back half of the year. As we\u2019ve emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halves not the quarters as weather patterns will change from year-to-year and shift the timing of sales between quarters. Although the first quarter has gotten off to a solid start, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather. We would expect improvements in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, continued strong markdown and inventory management and gross margin rate tailwind provided by the deflationary environment. We believe these factors will offset approximately 10 to 15 basis point headwind from increased transportation costs and the mix of merchandize. Although, we have modeled a decrease in fuel cost, it does not offset the stem mile increase as a result of the significant number of stores we opened last year in the west and project to open this year. In terms of cadence for gross margin percentage improvement, we target slight year-over-year improvement in each quarter expect for Q1 where we may experience a decrease as we cycle against limited markdowns as a result of last year\u2019s strong sell-through and we may also experience a slight headwind from the mix of C.U.E. items. And early spring would benefit Q2 margins as the spring mix of goods could have a positive impact. Inventory turns are expected to improve slightly. We would expect per store inventory to increase modestly consistent with the investments in key merchandizing categories. With respect to SG&A, as we grow the business, we have been able to absorb many of our ongoing initiatives into our expense run rate. We will continue to grow our business and the infrastructure with a long-term perspective, and as we do so some of the expected benefits may come in future periods but with the goal of driving mid-teens EPS growth. We continue to target maintaining SG&A growth in line with our sales growth. With this in mind, we expect to leverage SG&A into 3.5% to 4% comp sales range for 2015. With respect to SG&A by quarter, we believe that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter to leverage SG&A as it has a lower sales base and we will be executing our Northeast D.C. expansion. We expect the Southwest distribution center to open in Q4. We will be incurring preopening expense in the quarter with no transportation benefits until Q1 of 2016. We expect to leverage SG&A slightly in Q3 as we will be cycling our move to our new store support center last year. As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period at each quarterly conference call. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We go first to Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking my question. First question is with respect to demand planning system. Can you maybe provide some color as to how you think that will help you improve your turns or how much you think it will help you improve your working capital? If you could just maybe provide a little bit of color on what we can expect to that? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: Alan, this is Greg. The system itself is designed to do really several things. It\u2019s to help us understand that we\u2019re probably not maximizing, I would say, individual SKUs within the assortment as they sell-through in the stores. For example, if we got an item on a peg and we\u2019re selling through three items by Wednesday or Thursday of the week but yet we still have Friday and Saturday of selling days before replenishment runs and pushes inventory back to the store, demand planning is looking at that and recalculating that throughout the week and saying, wait a minute, potential missed opportunity, let\u2019s push more than three as a replenishment, let\u2019s push for six depending upon how it\u2019s pretty packed. That\u2019s the basic sales side of this and what that can mean we don\u2019t know yet. We just turned on several categories. We do think it will give us some sales lift over time. But this is a new system, work with [SaaS] [ph] on it.  And the other thing it should do for us, it should enable us to push more inventory to the stores on a more ready-time basis, meaning that instead of us waiting for several weeks for things to get adjusted, this will start pushing inventory a little faster which should move it through the supply chain a little faster. So what we may find is our turns may speed a little bit as we go through this, but I\u2019m not going to give you any forecast or guarantees at this point because we\u2019ve just turned it on in several departments. We like what we\u2019re seeing so far, but it\u2019s more about maximizing that inventory that\u2019s in the store today making sure that we\u2019re not running out of inventory in certain periods of time for our customer. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you, Greg. And one follow-up, if I may. With respect to converting the former Del\u2019s stores, can you maybe provide a schedule either by half as to how many stores we can expect will be converted? And what are the dynamics of those conversions compared to an average store with respect to incremental revenue increases? Thank you. Anthony F. Crudele: Alan, the way we look at it, as we go through the year, we\u2019ll try to update as to the schedule and how we\u2019ll handle the Del\u2019s stores. But generally, we look at it more on a top level basis that as we opened the new stores that Del\u2019s stores would represent about half of a TSC store and our general direction would be to count them basically as half a store net against the new store count. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Is the comp ramp of those stores similar to the comp ramp of a new store, a new Tractor store? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes. We\u2019re modeling it as such. Potentially, it could be a little bit faster because we do have name recognition. So they may come out of the box a little bit stronger. But until we start to open them, we don\u2019t have any data on how they will open. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you. Congratulations on a solid year. Anthony F. Crudele: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It\u2019s on the guidance for the upcoming year. You\u2019re looking for a flat to up 10 basis points on the operating margin. Your longer-term outlook calls for 25 basis points of annual improvement. So maybe you could walk us through what\u2019s going to be unique about this year that is resulting in a little less operating margin expansion than you expect? Anthony F. Crudele: Michael, this is Tony. When we look at the EBIT and our overall guidance, obviously over the years there will be some ebb and flow relative to our long-term targets. However, when we look at the numbers, we believe that our initiatives will continue to drive the gross margin improvement. We do anticipate obviously that headwind when it comes to freight and transportation costs as we\u2019ve opened up all the stores out west, so that does provide an additional headwind. And then relative to SG&A, we think that there is some more potential upside as depending on where we fall on the sales target. But as we have that incremental deflation that\u2019s in our forecast, that sort of dampens the sales forecast, so that limits some of the upside when it comes to the potential SG&A leverage. And then lastly, as we open up the Southwest distribution center in the latter part of the year, we don\u2019t anticipate having benefits from that until we move into 2016. So that\u2019s just a snapshot of the year. Michael Lasser : Would you say collectively the amount of spending on the initiatives this year is going to be less than it was last year? Anthony F. Crudele: It all depends how you define the investment. A lot of people look at investment as capital. So as we move into 2015, it does appear that our capital will be much higher because we just came off of a much lower year than I had anticipated. But when you look at investment as far as - also the related expenses, for example, if it\u2019s demand planning and additional headcount that we have to incur there, if it\u2019s opening up mixing centers and some of the startup costs related to a particular center, there\u2019s several things that are included in our forecast that are part of the expense structure as well that I would consider to be investing in the future and driving some of our key initiatives. So, when we look at investment, we look at both the capital side and the expense structure. And clearly as a growth company, we will continue to incur those and I believe that we have a significant portion of those already in our run rate and that\u2019s why we are focused on still delivering mid-teens EPS growth. Michael Lasser : Okay. And a quick follow-up. You have just over 10% of our store base in Texas and North Dakota. Obviously, those economies could be in a little bit of slowdown given what\u2019s happened in the price of oil. How impactful would that be to your total business and your comp given that those stores have probably been above average for the last couple of years? Steve K. Barbarick: Hi, Michael. It\u2019s Steve Barbarick here. We do have a number of oil drilling stores that we track and monitor and we went through an analysis over the last three or four months and right now those stores are tracking in line with our comp store sales. So, we don\u2019t see any major changes or material impact at this point in those stores. Michael Lasser : Okay. And do you think there could be an offset \u2013 if there were a slowdown, there would be an offset from the 90% of your stores that are not in oil levered areas given that your typical customer drives at a greater distance to your store than the average consumer to a store? Steve K. Barbarick: No. I would tell you at this point when it comes to those oil drilling stores, I mean if the comps are in line with the existing store base that trend will likely continue and we\u2019re watching it closely. And the next time we get together, if that question comes up, we\u2019ll give you more information on it. Gregory A. Sandfort: But to answer your question, as I said in the prepared remarks, we believe that there is potential and we\u2019re optimistic as to consumer behavior and the additional funds available because of lower gas cost for our consumer, but again we\u2019re a basic needs company and less susceptible to the sort of discretionary expense. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Thanks. A quick follow up on that one. So, Steve, when you did the analysis on the oil markets, I mean how many stores would you guys consider to be kind of I guess really exposed to kind of the fracing activity and things like that? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, looking at the numbers, we think right now it\u2019s about 10% of our store base, but again that ebbs and flows depending upon new rigs and what we\u2019re doing out there, but that\u2019s what we see right now. Peter Benedict : Okay. Thank you. And then just on the average ticket strength that you\u2019ve see despite the deflation \u2013 we\u2019ve now have a couple of quarters in a row, do you think we\u2019re turning the corner on some of the big ticket stuff or what do you need to see on that front in order to kind of maybe play a little more aggressively on those items? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: Peter, I would tell you that this last year was a good year in big ticket for us [indiscernible] but I don\u2019t think anyone here is ready to declare victory when it comes to big ticket. We\u2019re watching the POS data very closely and we\u2019re making tweaks to replenishment if we see any changes in consumers spending patterns. But right now I think we\u2019ve got a good plan laid out and we\u2019re just watching the trend line. So, again, we\u2019re being cautiously optimistic when it comes to big ticket. Peter Benedict : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : We now go to John Lawrence with Stephens. John Lawrence : Good afternoon, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort: Hi, John. John Lawrence : Just real quick. I know Steve you mentioned some, on the last quarterly call about some of the resets and how successful that was with product being in line and across all departments. Did that momentum continue into the fourth? Steve K. Barbarick: John, you heard Greg talk a little bit about the balance of our sales in Q4 and I would tell you, we talk a lot internally about making sure that the four walls of the box are working. And we came out of Q4 feeling pretty good about the fact that we\u2019re getting customers all the way around the building. A lot of that is a byproduct to the resets that we\u2019ve done. I would tell you we talked a little bit about the west side resets in the last call and we continue to see some nice sales momentum out of the work that we did back in '14. John Lawrence : Great. Thanks. Tony, can you give any insight on that gross margin; freight was up 20. What was the offset related to lower fuel? Anthony F. Crudele: The offset, it was just in the direct margin on our products. And again, Steve and the team did a great job in driving gross margin through our initiatives and in particular we really drove our price management, especially on some key seasonal product and that helped drive the initial margin on the product. John Lawrence : All right, thanks. Last one, is it too early to give us any kind of sense, the new Southwest D.C. reduction in stem miles or cost savings for that facility? Gregory A. Sandfort: John, it\u2019s Greg. The only thing I can tell you is when I\u2019m having to move freight to those stores in the far west over 1,000 miles, you can imagine the savings when I can say I can now get it within a 300 mile radius. We\u2019ve got some numbers that we\u2019ve run against it and I\u2019m not going to share the specifics yet because that building really won\u2019t come online until late next year. We\u2019re only going to see the benefit in '16, but it will be considerable, yes. Operator : Thank you. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow up. We now go to David Magee with SunTrust. David Magee : Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on a good quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. David Magee : Could you help us quantify the big ticket opportunity? Knock on wood, it continues to be more robust for you over the next couple of years, maybe indicate what percent of the mix it was back in its peak before and where we are now or just anything you can say to help us get our arms around that would be helpful? Anthony F. Crudele: David, this is Tony. It really is very difficult to quantify. I would tell you what we classify as big ticket is a really, really, really small percentage of the sales. And you can imagine those items over $350 compared to an average ticket of $46 to $48. But just a swing in that number of a few basis points can have a nice impact on the average ticket. So, as we looked at the year or in the quarter, in particular, items that are needs based, it could be a log splitter or a snow blower do particularly well and those are the items that generally are some of the drivers when it comes to big ticket. We do have some items that are more discretionary such as all-terrain vehicles and/or utility vehicles that we have that are very high priced as well. So, there\u2019s several things that will drive that, but again our customer is much more needs based and it\u2019s around that versus their discretionary spend. David Magee : Thank you, Tony. And just as a follow up, can you tell us what percent of the ecommerce volume is being picked up in the stores? And is that a number that would surprise you? Anthony F. Crudele: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s surprising. I think it\u2019s in line with a lot that others see. It could potentially be a little bit higher for us because the many things that we have are very large and bulky and the transportation is high, so they find it much more efficient to come to the store to pick it up. But we ship about 30% of our products go to the store, which again we think is great because it will take our customer to the store and could lead to potential increase in sales at the store level. David Magee : Got you. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : We now go to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, you mentioned aback to back late spring and this past year didn\u2019t break until seemingly late in May. Are you planning for an earlier spring sort of like how you planned for an early cold and you saw a great sell-through there? And are there any notable assortment changes in the seasonal category whether it\u2019s live goods or other consumable tests like you did with mulch and other tests that you ran this past year? Gregory A. Sandfort: We learned over the course of our careers in retail that trying to guess the weather you\u2019re never right. So you\u2019re always better going into a season with your carts loaded and your assortments out there for customers to see, because if you miss that first window, a lot of times you don\u2019t get that customer back. So we\u2019ve made some strategic inventory investments no different than we did in the fall. You heard Tony talk a little bit about that. So many of our outside products whether it be the fencing category, something we\u2019re doing with the outdoor power equipment, a little more careful with live goods because you got to be careful with the weather there. But we\u2019ll be ready for the season should we get an earlier season than we had the one last two years. We do plan for a normal spring. I will mention that as well. And a normal spring typically comes earlier than what we\u2019ve seen in the last two years. Christopher Horvers : Okay. And then as a follow-up question, Tony, what was the drag from saves \u2013 or whomever, what was the drag from saves in the fourth quarter? And does that flatten out as we look forward now that you\u2019re lapped down year-over-year comparisons? And then on depreciation and amortization dollars, how are you expecting those in 2015? Thanks. Anthony F. Crudele: All right. Chris, when it comes to the saves, we haven\u2019t provided that information as to what the percentage is and to what the drag was. As we\u2019ve worked through the year 2014, we were lapping some very strong numbers, so we would expect over 2015 that that headwind will moderate to a certain extent. So as we move into 2015, it should be less of a headwind. When it comes to depreciation, we\u2019re really looking at it and again we don\u2019t give quarter guidance, but overall we\u2019re looking at it sort of similar proration relative to 2014. We don\u2019t see anything unique about 2015 when it comes to depreciation and how you model it. Christopher Horvers : But what was the dollar share your modeling for the entire year? Anthony F. Crudele: We usually let you guys try to figure that one out. But generally, we\u2019re going to see around \u2013 a little bit over 10% increase when it comes to depreciation. Christopher Horvers : Okay, very helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Denise Chai : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a strong quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Denise Chai : Just wanted to get some more color on comps in the pet category and also could you give us a bit of an update on hometown pets? Are you planning to expand the tests at all? How do categories that you\u2019re seeing \u2013 categories in customers there differ from your core stores? And have you found in your learnings yet that you\u2019re already being able to transfer to your core stores? Steve K. Barbarick: Okay. I\u2019m going to start with this one. In terms of the pet business in Tractor Supply, we\u2019ve talked a lot about C.U.E. as an organization and this fits into that area. We talked about the strength of the four walls. The pet business for us continues to perform well and it\u2019s had continued momentum for a number of years now. We continue to modify assortments and bring in new and different things for our customers and it really suits our lifestyle. In terms of hometown pet, Lee? Lee J. Downing: Denise, this is Lee. Hometown pet is still \u2013 that\u2019s probably too early to call. We are very pleased with the progress and the learning that we have, but after only three months of being opened with the two locations, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s time for us to make any solid decisions on what we\u2019re going to do going forward. Right now it\u2019s a test and we\u2019re going to continue to learn and see how it applies to Tractor Supply. Denise Chai : Okay, understood. And just as a follow-up, in terms of your new stores this year, should we see those weighted more towards newer markets like the west as compared to fill-ins? And how would the mix of markets compare to 2014? Gregory A. Sandfort: I think this is a year where we\u2019ll continue to see a balanced approach throughout the country. I think we really like the west and we like the performance, but I think this year we went across a number of stores, probably a third, a third, a third if you look at it west center and east, so I don\u2019t feel it will be anything different this year. Denise Chai : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good afternoon. Tony, a follow-up question on the gasoline, I guess more of the cost of goods side, the stem miles, because I guess if you have 1,300 or so stores or almost 1,400 now, the savings that you get in the existing store and existing stem miles I guess conceptually would seem like they should start to offset some of the higher cost you\u2019re getting from the new Western markets. And I realize you\u2019re not going to give us what stem miles is, but maybe percentage wise just order of magnitude, what is that not enough to offset what\u2019s happening for the greater mileage out west? Anthony F. Crudele: A couple of things. One, we absolutely did include a projection as far as some of the fuel prices through the year. And again, it\u2019s difficult because fuel is extremely low right now. We\u2019re not sure how that will hold up throughout the course of the year. When it comes to the stem miles it is significant because it\u2019s not necessarily just the west stores, but as we open up and backfill in the east, a main store or a Massachusetts store could be very far from our Hagerstown DC. So we incur some additional stem miles as well with some of the backfill stores. So, I know you don\u2019t have a lot of details and we really don\u2019t provide it, but the stem miles, the additional cost exceeds the benefit of the lower diesel price. In addition to that, obviously we continue to increase our imports and so we have rising costs relative to imports. We also have \u2013 we anticipate having some driver cost increase to the transportation and then obviously there\u2019s always EPA and other government regulations that tend to drive the cost as well. So we do model some additional cost outside of the stem miles. Simeon Gutman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow up on also gross margin but more on the product side. Can you remind us what the product margin advantage is for exclusive brands over national? And then I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve said it about the same thing for direct import over non-imported? And then how that spread is? Is it static or is it getting better for you over time? Steve K. Barbarick: I\u2019ll answer that, Simeon. When it comes to the private label or exclusive brands, generally we\u2019ll see somewhere between 400 and 600 basis points. On a pure import, we\u2019re probably going to see somewhere between 600 and 1,000 basis point improvement. Now when I say a pure import, what I\u2019m talking about is when we\u2019re taking what is normally being sourced domestically and we move it over and bring it in generally from the Far East, there are times where our domestic distributor is also bringing in the product from the Far East and we insert ourselves into the process to reduce some of the transportation costs. In those cases, we will not experience 600 to 1,000 basis point improvement. It will be much lower. But generally our guidance is about 400 to 600 on the exclusive brands and around 800 ballpark for the imports. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Nice results. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : We go now to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : Just to follow up on that and the fuel cost, but I mean clearly with stem miles being such a big issue and with fuel cost much lower, the headwind from stem miles should be lower in 2015 versus 2014. Is that correct? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes, that is correct. Adam Sindler : Okay, great. And then just on the mixing centers, any reason why you chose Texas as the market to test that? Gregory A. Sandfort: Yes, simply put that\u2019s where we have the largest concentration of our feed business and highest velocity of that business, so there\u2019s no better place to test it than there. Adam Sindler : Got it, very good. Thanks, guys. Great results. Appreciate it. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities Jessica Schoen Mace : Hi. Good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort: Hi, Jessica. Jessica Schoen Mace : The first question I had was a follow up on the demand planning. You mentioned that you just this quarter began to turn it on in a few categories. What\u2019s your timeline and expectation for how that will progress over 2015? Gregory A. Sandfort: This is Greg. Let me give you a little bit of some insights about how this really works. Demand planning is being layered on top of our replenishment system. So it\u2019s going to make that system work a little harder, a little smarter. And we tested it initially, had good results, but this is no different than when we turned on Revionics and pricing optimization. You want to make sure that as you start to layer these systems on, they\u2019re doing what you expect and each category will act a little differently; different in hardware than it will probably be over in, let\u2019s say, pet toys and things of that nature. So, we\u2019re going to be very careful that we don\u2019t jump the gun on this and make sure that we know the type of results we expect to get. So, it\u2019s going to be a [indiscernible]. It\u2019s probably going to be sometime in '16, maybe over '16 before it\u2019s complete. Jessica Schoen Mace : Great, understood. And then my second question is on ecommerce. Even though it\u2019s still a small part of the business, are there any overall categories that translate best online where you\u2019ve seen a lot more volume in the merchandize mix? Gregory A. Sandfort: Well, I think you can easily understand that some of the very, very large ticket items can be challenging because they have to go LTL delivery, they can\u2019t be pulled out of a distribution center as easily and dropped into a box and shipped to the customer. So things like apparel, footwear, things that are smaller in size are easier picks for us, but it\u2019s interesting though. We have had a nice LTL business. It\u2019s a safe business in some other large categories. So for us you have to think about why the customer would chose to shop online versus coming to the store and it\u2019s primarily they have the time to be able to take the receipt of the product. They don\u2019t have an urgent need to have it today. Many of our customers come in and I need it now. So online would not serve that. But they\u2019re looking at it from a standpoint of convenience and ease of shopping with us and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to look at our business as more of an omni-channel business today where we\u2019re trying to give the customer the ability to shop with us anytime, anyplace, anywhere. Jessica Schoen Mace : So would you say customers are finding that as a good solution for the C.U.E. business or more so the other ones you mentioned, like apparel and --? Gregory A. Sandfort: I would say less for C.U.E. probably and more for the other things that are more unique; it could be a tractor part, it could be a pair of shoes and it could be something that they see in seasonal. But I think for the heavy, heavy high velocity, C.U.E. items at this point it doesn\u2019t seem to be that desirable for the customer just yet. Jessica Schoen Mace : Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Operator : We now go to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : Hi. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones. First, how many stores will pull from the new Arizona, D.C. when it launches in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, could you give us a little bit of insight into any product resets or updated planograms that you\u2019re planning in the first half of this year? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort: When the D.C. and the Southwest opens, it will be servicing less than 100 stores initially. And as far as new planograms sets and such, I\u2019ll let Steve take that one. Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, I mean we rarely get into the specifics around planograms and resets, but I can tell you one of the focus areas for us as an organization is going to be around newness. And in terms of newness you\u2019re going to see it through resets, you\u2019re going to see it through testing and you\u2019re going to see it through localization. The team is highly focused in those areas as well as on the C.U.E. side of our business. We\u2019re looking at broadening assortments, managing the inventory, so we\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re a dependable supplier and making sure we\u2019re priced right in the market. So generally speaking, we\u2019re not going to give specifics about the resets but I can tell you there\u2019s a lot of work being done behind the scenes. Matt Nemer : Can you expect any significant changes to the outside of the store, the outside area of the store? Steve K. Barbarick: Here\u2019s what I can tell you. We have talked about this on several calls and we tested a number of things in 2014 that were unique and different and we just didn\u2019t gain a whole lot of traction relative to those initiatives. I can tell you that the sales on the outside of the building are better than they\u2019ve been. We continue to see comp store sales pretty strong in a couple of key areas out there, but there\u2019s still more work to be done and we will be doing more testing in '15. We just haven\u2019t figured out how to get more traffic into that side yard. Matt Nemer : Okay, very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : We now go to Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark Miller : Hi, everyone. I think in Tony your prepared remarks in the headwind column for gross margins, you mentioned the mix of merchandize. So, can you elaborate on that? Are you highlighting to simply the effects of continued growth in C.U.E. and possibly big ticket? And then I have a question on private label. You had nice growth there over the years, but I think in the back half it was pretty flattish or maybe down a little bit as a percent of sales. What\u2019s the outlook for that and key initiatives if you think you can grow that in 2015? Anthony F. Crudele: Sure, Mark. This is Tony. I\u2019ll let Steve handle the private label, but just very briefly you\u2019re correct. The main driver when it comes to mix merchandize and the potential headwind is really around C.U.E. and our continued increasing C.U.E. as part of the mix. Steve K. Barbarick: In terms of exclusive brands for private label, what we saw really in the back half had a lot to do with the inflation. A lot of our exclusive brands are around some of the C.U.E. items and they just weren\u2019t as high a percent of sales. Mark Miller : Okay. And then a separate question on incentive comp in your '15 plan. Are you assuming that incentive comp is a similar percent of sales, is it back to normal, how is that changing? Thanks. Anthony F. Crudele: Generally, we\u2019ll look at it in 2015 as a similar percentage relative to 2014. Mark Miller : All right, great. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Brian Nagel : A couple of follow up \u2013 quick follow ups here. With all the talk about stem miles and gas prices, just remind us, due to any type of hedging with respect to fuel cost, are there any type of contracts that could delay a benefit of lower prices on new distribution? Anthony F. Crudele: Brian, no. We currently have not hedged nor have we in the past. It is something that we would evaluate but there\u2019s nothing that would prevent us from capturing fuel cost in the current environment. Brian Nagel : Okay. Tony, you commented in your prepared remarks that this year we saw may be a stronger sales of winter product early in the season as people stocked up. Does that pose any type of potential risk to comps to sales in the first quarter as maybe as demand [indiscernible] is that largely washed out through the course of fourth quarter? Anthony F. Crudele: Yes. I was trying to give a little bit of color as to the quarter and how it shaped up, but as we moved into 2015 I had also indicated that we really felt that we were in a great inventory position to be in a better shape than we were last year to take advantage of the cold weather in January and February timeframe. And we feel very good about the replenishment cycle and our ability to get goods into the store as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2015. Brian Nagel : Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll keep it quick. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : We go now to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort: Hi, Matt. Matthew Fassler : My first question guys relates to deflation. It moderated a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third. As I look at the inputs, you often talk about \u2013 obviously fuel is down substantially, the metal piece is down as well. Grains look like they\u2019re a little bit less of a drag. Was it that grains piece impacting deflation in C.U.E. products or were there other factors there? And kind of in tandem with that question, Tony, during your run through of the quarter, you talked about price management in seasonal products. Just wanted to understand what that meant and how that might have factored in? Gregory A. Sandfort: Sure. Matt, on deflation, again, you hit the nail on the head. It was really the corn prices and the feed. They tend to cycle through a little bit quicker. As much as we did have the benefit on the oil and steel, they take awhile for that to sort of cycle through. So really the corn was the main driver. Matthew Fassler : And so \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Gregory A. Sandfort: I was going to move then to the price management. Anthony F. Crudele: Yes. When we came into the season, I think we had strong retail price points. We got the early season sales which certainly benefited us, so we didn\u2019t get on the back half of the season. And we also saw a lot of strong demand on certain categories and some shortages in some areas. So rather than bringing prices down, we\u2019re able to maintain and we saw a lift in margins as a result. Matthew Fassler : Any particular categories where that played out? Anthony F. Crudele: Seasonal, mainly in the heating categories. Matthew Fassler : Got it. And then just finally to go back to your initial answer as you modeled deflation, it sounds like probably deepening a little bit again, a couple tenths perhaps from Q4 to the first part of the year. Is there anything that you\u2019ve seen in grains, which I guess remain under some pressure here or is there more the flow through of petrol and metals, et cetera, any impact that that will have on some of the slower cycle businesses? Gregory A. Sandfort: Again, to start off the season we expect a tick up in the deflation more related to the corn prices and cycling against last year. The oil and steel, a little bit more of a wildcard. As we move through the year, we will have a much better feel for that and how those prices adjust and how that can flow through our inventory comps. Matthew Fassler : Got it, guys. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : Now we go to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon, everyone, and great quarter. Guys, when you\u2019re looking at the big ticket merchandize, can you sort of spill out for us what\u2019s driving that? Was is the pickup in demand by a more confident consumer as some of their stuff wearing out, so they need it now or was the certain aspects of the weather helping that? Anthony F. Crudele: I would say that it\u2019s probably a little bit of all that, but weather certainly did help. We talked earlier about a lot of the seasonal businesses taking off early, things like log splitters and some heating products, snow blowers and the like. So, we saw the benefit of that in the back half. But like we said, this has been a trend and we finished the year with a big ticket increase. We tend to be cautiously optimistic as we go into next year and we\u2019re looking at assortments. And if the customer is willing to vote up, we\u2019re willing to bring him the product to service their lifestyle. Chuck Cerankosky : Excellent. And how about the strong dollar and cost of imported product, what\u2019s that doing to margin? What do you expect it to do to margins? Anthony F. Crudele: At this point, we haven\u2019t seen a material impact one way or the other. We\u2019re watching it very closely. The team\u2019s just gotten back from overseas right now putting together a spring program for the following year and we\u2019re watching it very closely. But I don\u2019t see that having a material impact on the business. Chuck Cerankosky : All right, thank you. Operator : We now go to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson : [Indiscernible] good job on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I think, Tony, you mentioned that you thought the consumer was feeling more optimistic. And I know your results were terrific. It didn\u2019t really show necessary acceleration from prior quarters, so I\u2019m just wondering what it is may be underneath that you\u2019re seeing whether it\u2019s particular customer types or just small nuances in the business to get us get confident in that trend? Anthony F. Crudele: Again, relative to the comments, the prepared remarks, we were sort of looking at 2015 and the consumer and what we keep hearing about the consumer. When we look at our business, I think Steve\u2019s talked about it a little bit, we\u2019ll step up to the plate when it comes to need-based purchase and we\u2019ve seen them move to some higher price point and larger ticket items. So we see that in our consumer. We see a little bit of an increase in items per transaction. So they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re putting a little bit more in their basket. So there are some minor trends, but again as much as we\u2019re optimistic that the consumer is more confident coming into 2015, we do realize that we are more of a needs based retailer and may not get the uptick that other retailers that are more focused on discretionary benefits. Aram Rubinson : And then just a follow up as you\u2019re looking at 2015. I understand the composition of sales but can you tell us about kind of new merchandize adds, new brands, things that you\u2019re kind of super excited about that we should be thinking about as accretive to the year? Steve K. Barbarick: I would go back to the philosophy of continuous improvement and risk taking with that question. The merchant team and the organization is excited about a lot of the new things we\u2019ll be bringing out this next year and it\u2019s not in any specific area. And I would tell you it\u2019s across the board. Like I said earlier, we\u2019re going to focus on newness when it comes to resets and things we\u2019re doing in the center course of our stores. A lot of testing and localization is going to take place and the focus will continue to be on C.U.E. items. So we\u2019re not going to get off track of what\u2019s got us here. We\u2019re just going to be better at what we\u2019ve done. Aram Rubinson : Sounds like a good plan. Thanks for the taking the question. Gregory A. Sandfort: You\u2019re welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good evening. Gregory A. Sandfort: Hi, Seth. Seth Basham : My question\u2019s around fuel price as well, just trying to understand a little bit better, if I go back and look at what happened in 2009 where there were big declines in the fuel prices, diesel was down between 40% and 50% for most of the year. You guys are saving anywhere from 40 to 50 basis points in gross margin as a result. Is there anything different about your business now? I would think that for result this time around it should be magnified in terms of the amount of savings per percentage point decline in fuel prices given the increased stem miles that you\u2019re running? Anthony F. Crudele: Well, history does have a tendency to repeat itself but again as we move into 2015, we\u2019re looking at the trend in the business and we put together what we believe is a model that is very consistent with how we model in the years past. Seth Basham : Got you. Gregory A. Sandfort: I think here some factors are different, a lot more stores in the west. There\u2019s other conditions with just the availability of equipment and drivers. Now those things didn\u2019t happen back in 2009. So we talked to the trucking industry people, they\u2019ll give you some \u2013 a little bit of education on what is really different today versus back then. Seth Basham : Got you, okay. And then secondly, a different question, on C.U.E. In terms of the margin headwind for 2015, would you expect it to be bigger or smaller relative to 2014? Gregory A. Sandfort: Relative to the merchandize mix headwind, it should moderate relative to 2014 and sort of similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit more limited relative to what had transpired in the first three quarters of the year. So we expect it to moderate but we still anticipate it to be a headwind. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. A question for Steve, interested in the experience in 2014 specifically with the infill stores and the West Coast stores, anything that you\u2019ve learned that you\u2019re applying in '15 in terms of merchandizing to sustain productivity in those stores or enhanced productivity in those new stores? Steve K. Barbarick: Well, out west, I\u2019ll tell you, our model I would go as far as to say about 85% of our model or basic model will work most places geographically. There\u2019s probably maybe another 15% that needs to be tweaked by area of the country. And when we went out west, I would say that you know what, our first effort was fair, it wasn\u2019t right on. We continue to tweak and modify those assortments. There are things that we\u2019ll learn out there that probably will be applied back at this point, but I\u2019m not prepared to go through looking at those items. But you know what, there\u2019s a lot of tests that we do with the existing stores that I\u2019m sure the West Coast stores will benefit from as well. So in general, I would tell you there\u2019s still a lot of learning to be done out west when it comes to assortments. Eric Bosshard : That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly within hometown pet, a similar type of question and I know it\u2019s early days, but the experience and the outlook for learnings from that being applicable across the store base, what are your thoughts or experience to-date in that regard? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, I would say at this point it\u2019s still so early in the game to take much from that. We\u2019re watching it closely and as we learn from that, we will be applying it back to the model but it will be a test at the Tractor stores before all. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question as well. I wanted to ask just a couple of quick follow-ups. The couple of mixing centers that you\u2019re going to open this year, can you remind us what the kind of long-term target for mixing centers are and what kind of impact it does have on the margins? Gregory A. Sandfort: Joe, this is Greg. Mixing centers as we have scoped them and this is an initial pass, probably 20 to 30 across the country. Again, placing these where we have a high \u2013 a large animal count and where we do a tremendous amount of, let\u2019s say, feed type business. There are some that we\u2019ll place in the Northeast because of the wood pellet business and things of that nature. But remember, these are going to be used to push full palletized, high velocity product to the stores much faster in a way from putting it away in a normal distribution center and pulling it back. So it\u2019s going to really bring the stem mile usage way down on some of that kind of product. Joseph Feldman : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And I guess initially, have you seen any \u2013 like is it a significant margin benefit? I guess I trust the stem miles pretty significantly but --? Gregory A. Sandfort: It\u2019s a little bit of a drag because there\u2019s some SG&A you got to put into place initially and there is a benefit on the other side where the stem miles are cut and the turnaround time of holding an inventory is going to be sustainably less. So if I can push inventory to a store four times a week versus having to do it in large quantities once a week or once every two weeks, there\u2019s a lot of benefit to that. Joseph Feldman : Yes, that makes sense. And then just one other quick question. How are you guys doing in terms of tailoring the store to the local markets? I know it\u2019s kind of this ongoing evolution, but where do you think you are at this point and I know where you want to be, but where are we in that process? Steve K. Barbarick: Yes, this is Steve. Every time I feel like we\u2019re making progress, I realize that there\u2019s a lot more work to do. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to get it exactly right because there\u2019s so much opportunity out there. And our merchant teams are tasked with travelling to different markets. We get a lot of feedback from the field. That\u2019s one of the great things about our organization. And we work as a team to make sure that we\u2019re taking care of the customer and the right markets and serving the lifestyle. So, I couldn\u2019t even give you an inning at this point. All I can tell you is there\u2019s a lot more work that we can do. Joseph Feldman : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Good luck with this quarter guys. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Sandfort for any closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for your interest and support of our Tractor Supply Company and we look forward to speaking to you again in April as we will then review our first quarter performance. Operator : This does conclude our conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Gregory Sandfort : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our EVP Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate. We\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015 and the ongoing trends within our business. Our comparable store sales for the quarter increased 5.7% and our increase was once again driven by both traffic and ticket. Transaction counts increased 4.8%, while average ticket improved 80 basis points in the quarter. This was our 22nd consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales and our 28th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. Sales were balanced across the store and throughout the quarter, with all of our major merchandise categories and geographic regions delivering positive solid comps. Our merchandising and inventory management teams did an excellent job of managing assortments and flow of inventory to deliver strong sales for the quarter. We had the right products at the right time to meet customer demand in both seasonal and everyday products. In seasonal, we made several strategic investments in heating, footwear and apparels that met strong demand in cold weather items in the northern tier of our stores. Similarly, we had the right assortment of spring merchandise when the weather began to turn more in our southern markets. This allowed us to meet the initial demand and drive sales in a number of spring seasonal categories towards the latter part of the first quarter. Categories such as fencing and live goods, lawn and garden and outdoor power equipment all performed very well in the quarter. We also saw very solid performance from many of our everyday staples and consumable, usable and edible products. We continue to experience sales momentum in the left-hand side of the store. The planogram updates we executed in truck accessories and winches along with several other categories in hardlines this past year continued to resonate with our customers. And as we discussed on our last call, IT systems and our supply chain remain key areas of focus for 2015 and we continue to make solid progress against these initiatives. The rollout of our new demand planning system is on target and we will continue adding categories throughout the year. Construction of a new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona is on schedule and this new facility is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2015. The two mixing centers in Texas are also under construction and are scheduled to open in the third quarter of this year. We opened 41 new stores in the quarter and we remain on track to open 110 to 115 new Tractor Supply stores this year. Progress continues with the conversion of the Del\u2019s stores to the Tractor format and we expect to close seven Del\u2019s stores this year as we backfill the State of Washington with Tractor Supply formats. And lastly, we are pleased with our ongoing efforts and progress to enhance our omni-channel platform, our customer relationship management platform and the broadening of our IT network security across our entire organization. 2015 is off to a solid start, and while it is still early in the year, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from a more normalized spring weather pattern as the momentum of our business has continued into April. In closing, let me thank all of our dedicated team members out there in our stores [indiscernible] who go the country mile everyday for our customers who live this lifestyle. We appreciate your time today. I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our financials for the quarter. Tony? Anthony Crudele : Great, thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 28, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12.5% to $1.3 billion and net income grew 18.9% to $58 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with both our top line and bottom line performance for the quarter. Comp store sales increased 5.7% in the first quarter compared to an increase of 2.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. We had a very strong winter selling season, specifically in February as cold weather drove our sales and assisted us in the clearance of winter products. We did enter the quarter in a higher inventory position than in the prior year which benefited sales, but resulted in more clearance having a slightly negative impact on gross margin. The sales momentum continued into March, although the average temperatures were still colder than normal, they were warmer than last year in the majority of our sales regions which spurred strong spring seasonal sales. This was particularly evident in the South and Southwest regions. We are extremely pleased with the strong sales results for the quarter and the team should be commended as we accomplished this against several headwinds which included deflation, closed store days and logistics issues related to winter storms and challenges from the West Coast port congestion. Comp transaction count increased for the 28th consecutive quarter, gaining 4.8% on top of a 4.4% increase last year. As Greg indicated, the strength in sales was very broad-based. Few items such as the pet and heating consumables continued to perform well, but we also had strong sales in key winter categories such as insulated outerwear and rubber footwear as well as spring seasonal categories such as riding lawn mowers, fencing and lawn and garden. Average comp ticket increased by 80 basis points versus last year\u2019s 201% decline. We are very pleased with the composition of the comp ticket increase given deflation and effectively no impact from big ticket. The increases were primarily from an increase in items per transaction, trade up in key categories such as animal and bird feed, and an increase in bulk transactions such as fencing. This increase was partially offset by deflation which we estimate at 87 basis points and was consistent with our expectations. The deflation was driven principally by the livestock feed, bird feed, lubricant and propane categories. With respect to big ticket, we\u2019re pleased with the kickoff to the spring selling season as we saw a nice lift in riding lawn mowers and trailers. This increase in big ticket was partially offset by the continued decline in the gun fit category and thus big ticket did not contribute to the increase in the average ticket. On a regional basis, comp sales were possible across all regions, as sales in the North benefited from colder weather in the first half of the quarter and the sales in the South benefited from favorable spring weather in March. The Western region comp sales were above chain average as our newer Western stores continue to gain market awareness and share. With respect to gross margin, we anticipated that gross margin would be a tough comparison to last year, but it was only slightly down at 8 basis points to 33.4%. If you recall, many winter related items sold out early in the quarter last year and gross margin benefited from limited clearance activity. This year we ended the quarter better in stock. Although the favorable colder weather in January and February provided strong sell through of our seasonal winter product, we had more inventory in our clearance pipeline. This had a slight negative impact on margin, but benefited sales. Additionally, we had less new store discounts in the quarter as Q1 gross margin last year benefited from several store openings late in 2013. Shrink was also slightly negative in the quarter as we cycle favorable results in the prior year. We did have several items that favorably impacted gross margin. Sales was favorable by 5 basis point which was a direct result of the lower [indiscernible]. The favorable fuel price offset the increase in stem miles from our Western store expansion. Merchandise mix had a favorable impact as some higher margin categories increased as a percent of total sales. Deflation had a positive impact on gross margin as we focused on maintaining margin dollars per unit. Import purchases in the quarter increased 5.2% and represented 11.5% of sales mix, also exclusive brand sales increased over 10.8% compared to last year\u2019s Q1 and was approximately 32% of sales. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.4% of sales compared to 26.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points. We are pleased with our expense control in the quarter, which coupled with the strong comp sales, provided solid leverage. We experienced favorable trends in medical, marketing, and various occupancy expense categories. We were able to leverage store personnel despite having made additional investment in store payrolls surrounding store initiatives. Incentive compensation had a deleveraging impact of 26 basis points as incentive compensation increased year over year based on the strength of the quarter results. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.9% in Q1 compared to 37.6% last year, resulting from the availability of state tax incentives. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q1, we had cash balance of $57 million and borrowings of $60 million compared to a cash balance of $48 million and debt of $80 million last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 596,000 shares for $47.9 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program for the quarter did not have a material impact on EPS. Average inventory levels per store increased 2.7% compared to the prior year. We are very comfortable with our inventory position as we made a strategic investment in certain spring merchandise and imports were timed a little earlier to work around the Chinese New Year. Annualized turns improved by 1 basis point for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48.8 million as compared to $41.9 million last year. We opened 41 stores and closed one store in the first quarter compared to 32 new stores opened in the first quarter of 2014. The increase relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest D.C., which were higher than expenditures on our store support center which was under construction last year. With respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2015, as noted in today\u2019s press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. While our Q1 performance was very strong and Q2 is off to a good start, as we said in the past, it is best to evaluate a performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it\u2019s prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, we still expect full year sales range from $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion; we have forecasted comp sales to increase between 2.5% and 4%; we\u2019re targeting EBIT margins to be flat to 10 basis points of improvement compared to 2014; we expect a modest improvement in gross margin; and SG&A leverage will be dependent on the sales level achieved. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $403 million to $417 million or $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share. We still expect capital expenditures in 2015 to range between $240 million to $250 million. We\u2019ll continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and estimate full year diluted shares outstanding to be between 136 million and 137 million. We continue to be estimate deflation for the full year to average approximately 50 basis points and we anticipate the impact will be higher in the first half of the year and moderating downward in the second half of the year. In terms of the cadence for gross margin percent improvement, we target slight year over year improvement in each of the upcoming quarters. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict : First, maybe Greg, the current view of consumer shelf, your customer shelf, I mean obviously the numbers looks to be pretty good, but if you go below the high level numbers, any signs you are seeing positive or negative in terms of the behavior of your customer in any specific regions, whether it would be in the oil related markets or anything else that you would call out that\u2019s maybe been changing over the last 3 to 6 months? Gregory Sandfort : I would tell you that steadier she goes, the consumer that shops with us seems to be in a bit of a predictable pattern. They are still buying needs based product, they\u2019re still repairing and not doing probably as much replacements as they did in the past, although we have seen bit of an uptick in outdoor power equipment in the first part of the year, but that\u2019s not to say that conditions can change. We are not seeing anything really different. They\u2019re still buying feed and food, they\u2019re still keeping their properties because \u2013 our fencing business was great as we mentioned, and our feed and food businesses continue strong. So I would tell you very stable, if anything probably as the economy could improve a bit maybe towards the latter part of this year and into next year, we may see little bit of an uptick, but nothing that would alarm us at all. Peter Benedict : And then remind us about the cadence of spring life share, I remember you said it late, and you guys resorted to some incremental promotions, at what point did that set in in the second quarter last year? And then maybe how are you planning this season differently in some of these key categories, like OP and the riders, some of your live good product, because it obviously sounds like this spring is getting off to a better start. Gregory Sandfort : First of all, last year we just had a major delay with Mother Nature and weather and until the weather broke we were managing inventories well and just we\u2019re trying to understand how much business could be recapture as we got into latter part of the second quarter and into third. And as far as adding promotions, all we did was just somewhat remind consumer we are still there for them and that we made them aware of some of the offers and such. So we spent a little money, but nothing major. We didn\u2019t do anything crazy as far as pricing and such last year, we just stayed patient. No, this year very different. We are having a more normalized spring season and we don\u2019t plan at this point to anniversary any of those, I will call them, reminder type pieces that we did last year in the latter part of second and early into third quarter, if the trends continue as we see them. So we are feeling more comfortable about current trends, but there is no additional plans to go back and anniversary some of those things that we did a year ago. Operator : And we will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : One quick question on gross margin and then something strategic. Just in terms of the clearance merchandise activity, could you just tell us in order of magnitude what that could held down gross margin? And if you can\u2019t, maybe directionally, what roughly the percentage of items sold on clearance was and maybe in terms of magnitude of the markdown? Steve Barbarick : I would tell you the magnitude is relatively insignificant. We did see, like Tony said, a bit of a sales gain, but as you come out of the season like that, the tail of those sales become smaller and smaller. And so the magnitude of the impact is pretty immaterial to the total business. There may have been a slight impact, but it would be nothing that will be material. Simeon Gutman : And then the second question for Greg, just thinking about categories in a store and how it flows, and I know you have the new mock store, I don\u2019t know what you call it, but the new planogram area at FHC, was that designed to just look at how you execute certain categories, are you thinking there is a bigger wholesale change in how you flow the store over time? Gregory Sandfort : I think this is a two-part question, Steve will answer as much as I can here, but the MIC, the merchandise innovation center is our ability to take a complete Tractor store and look at it from a standpoint of planogram sets, lower store, visual signage, just generally as you walk in to a store, we didn\u2019t have that capability in the former space that we had in the old facility and we felt like if we couldn\u2019t really do the same thing in this new facility because of the ceiling height and such, so we went outside and it\u2019s been very productive. I think I will let Steve take it from there. Steve Barbarick : One of the greatest benefits of it is the size is all the products that we have in a normal store and to be able to get the merchants out there, the marketers out there, even people internally that have to deal with stores on a day-in, day-out basis, we can walk those planograms, we can assess the profitability per square foot, we can try a lot of things out there and get a visual that all at one time rather than breaking in apart in little 4 and 8 foot sections. So really it\u2019s a matter of efficiencies, getting things handed to the stores more timely and really better execution. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson : One of the things that\u2019s hard to just do is to have continued success without showing any signs of complacency. I think you have done that. Just wondering what it is you are doing internally to kind of fight against that trend? It seems like you still have not invited in new competition, you are still one of the very few retailers that doesn\u2019t have competitors. So can you give us a little bit more color on what you are doing to try and sustain that, it seems pretty difficult to do? Steve Barbarick : And I would tell you that\u2019s cultural, that\u2019s in the fabric of Tractor Supply Company. When we talk about continuous improvement, TVS, processes, when you talk about relentless dissatisfaction, you everything from stores to operations to everyone else, we\u2019re focused on making sure that we are running a little faster and jumping a little higher than we did the year before. I would tell you that when we walk planograms there is no \u2013 this works. And we\u2019re just going to leave it as it is. We will just talk about good as the enemy of great and how we are going to get better at each quarter and each year. So part of what we do and part of what you continually hear from this management team is taking it to the next level. In terms of competition, we can\u2019t necessarily impact people coming into the market place, but we\u2019re focused on us in making our business better and really supporting the customers that live lifestyle that we support. Aram Rubinson : And I just got a follow up just to ask about your customer, as you get to learn more about him and hopefully her, can you help us dimensionalize to share your customer today and how you think what over time that might change? Gregory Sandfort : Today the mix of our consumer base is fairly equal male to female. What I think we are finding is that their ability to use us for more things as they shop our stores is what we are starting to see and we are enjoying that, meaning that they may have started out shopping with us buying for their horses, let\u2019s say, products for the horses, and then he noticed we are in the pet business, and the next thing they know they get their pet business, and then from there they may move to another category, whether it might be holding or could be something in the hardware department. So what we\u2019re starting to understand now is that this hobby lifestyler is more open to shop Tractor for more than just maybe the things than initially thought. I will also tell you that we noticed in our parking lots it\u2019s not always pickup trucks, you may see a BMW, you may see someone walk in in a suit and tie, because they happen their own property and they work in a city, an attorney or what have you. So this crossover of consumer right now, we\u2019re starting to track some things and starting to notice that we are not \u2013 there\u2019s not a barrier to shop or store may be as it may have been in the past. The name Tractor Supply sometimes shows people, but once they cross the threshold or they hear about us from someone else, a lot of this is word-of-mouth, they are delighted. We have a lot of families that shop our stores. And if it starts with that age, maybe the grandfather to the son and then from there to the children, we are just kind of perpetuation of how the business can develop over the years. So I think we are in a great spot, we like what we see with our consumer base and we continue to see more transactions coming through the front door, footsteps as well. So right now there is more for us to do to learn more about these consumers and talk to them in a more direct manner, but I think we are well on our way. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : So I wanted to follow up on the weather question, would you describe the first quarter is relatively normal even in your northern tier stores through the end of March and how do you think it plays out over the next two quarters? The past two years had a pretty late start to spring in the North, back to back years, but you also had the seasonal business extend into August and September. So just curious how you are thinking about the flow of the business over the next couple of quarters. Steve Barbarick : I would tell you that you could probably look at certain parts of the north and say that they may have had even delayed spring to normal, but I would tell you based on the prior two years it was earlier. And we were able to capitalize on that business both in terms of seasonal sales cold and spring related products. We are going to continue to buy into the spring, knowing that there is demand out there. It\u2019s just too early at this point for us to pull back for the South or for the north. So I don\u2019t see anything that we would do outside of the way we are operating today and that is making sure those stores have the inventory they need. I\u2019m not sure I answered your question specifically. Christopher Horvers : I think that\u2019s fair. I guess the last part of the question is do you think that last past two years you had a shift into August and September on the seasonal business, does it more of normalized start result in sort of shorter season on the back end comparatively? Steve Barbarick : I would tell you right now it\u2019s just too early to predict the full year and even whether or not the selling season is going to be extended. Our guidance assumes a normalized spring selling season, that\u2019s really the best I can tell you at this point at this time of the year. Christopher Horvers : And then on the margin front, Tony, so the fuel savings offset the freight \u2013 the stem mile pressures, is there anything one time in nature about that, feasibly one would think that may be through freight negotiations you would get more benefit in future quarters and provide some extra belief as you progress throughout the year? Anthony Crudele : There was nothing unusual in the quarter. As we have talked in the past about our transportation costs, there is the cost themselves, there is the fuel component which is about 20% of the cost and then there is the stem mile issue that we talked about. In this case, we\u2019ve not seen any significant increase in the transportation cost and obviously fuel was decreased and that\u2019s what offset the stem miles. As we move forward I remind you that we will be opening more stores out in the West, so that will add to the stem miles. But as we move forward with the fuel prices, obviously that will be an ongoing benefit if the prices stay low and help to reduce the additional cost related to the stem miles. Christopher Horvers : On the incentive comp, was that basically just a timing shift and there will be a quarter may be later in the year in the back half with a stronger that incentive comp will end up being a benefit or was the incentive comp accrual maybe shifted out relative to your original plan? Anthony Crudele : No, in this case the incentive comp is going to match up with the performance that was in the quarter itself and again we will look at both the quarter and the performance and we\u2019ll also you look at our expectations for the full year. But when you look on a quarter to quarter basis, Q1 this year to last year, this was a much stronger quarter and required us to book additional incentive compensation. Operator : And we will take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Tony, I think you talked a little bit about trading up as one of the ticket offsets. At analyst day, I think you\u2019ve highlighted some plans across a number of different categories to maybe modify the assortment, fill the gap between good and best price points, just wondering and I think you highlighted power tools as may be an example that you are going to change over in the first quarter, just speak a little bit about some of the work you\u2019re doing on that front and may be where there are other categories with opportunities for that? Steve Barbarick : Let me start by saying that the inside of the box is in continued flux and change and that\u2019s part of the whole relentless dissatisfaction talk that we had. One of the resets that we\u2019re doing in planogram work that we have got going on in the stores is to tap into missing price points and/or brands that we may not have today offering the customer value at the middle part of the equation or premium products. I will give you just one example here, because I can probably go through a number of them, but in May, we\u2019re going to be launching an extended line of livestock feeds for our consumers, a product that we did not have access to prior to this point in working with Parena and having the chequerboard product, we will have access to a super premium equivalent feed. We\u2019re going to bring in a new line of cattle feed and lastly we will have show feeds for those folks that do for H and FFA, which again we didn\u2019t have access to previously. So that would be one example in a product category that this queue that we see will benefit the customer bought on the high end as well is in the middle tier. Seth Sigman : And then just a follow up on a question earlier about the clearance impact in the quarter, late last year you guys implemented a clearance module to help mitigate the impact, did that help at all this quarter or is that something we should expect to build the road this year, anymore color there would be helpful? Steve Barbarick : We implemented it in Q4 and it had \u2013 again we are rolling this out, so it only impacted a very small portion of our clearance inventory, but the results we saw where positive and give us some enthusiasm as we move forward with the program. So at this point it wasn\u2019t real material in the quarter, but I can tell you that we will continue to roll forward and I suspect sometime this year we will have fully implemented the clearance price optimization program. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : My first question is on the sales performance in the quarter, how would you characterize the performance relative to your expectation and what was better, was it the weather or was it share gains, was it the performance of some of your initiatives, because obviously performance was better than most, we are expecting \u2013 what I guess I\u2019m trying to understand the sustainability of it? Steve Barbarick : Let me go ahead and start, this is Steve and then we\u2019ll have some follow ups potentially. I would tell you \u2013 in the opening remarks, we were really pleased with the firewall sales. It didn\u2019t come out of one specific area of sales, if you look across all of the buying teams and the categories we had, the vast majority of them had positive comp store sales. We saw good business both in all regions of the country as well as when you look at it it was pretty much well balanced across. So from that perspective, I think we also feel very good about it. And a lot of it has to do with initiatives. A lot of it has to do with new products as well as weather. So I think it was a good quarter across the board. Michael Lasser : And then when you think about the weather for the rest of the year, is the first quarter tend to be \u2013 first and the second quarter tend to mean most volatile, so if it stays warmer later in the year into fall, is that less punitive to your performance of your business that if it stays colder longer into the spring? Anthony Crudele : I would tell you that actually each quarter has its own uniqueness to it. As we\u2019ve said in the past and sort of mapped out a year, we like it to have a strong cold January and February, we like it to warm up in where it\u2019s possible starting in March. And then as we\u2019ve experienced in the last couple of years, the cool weather has extended the spring summer season into the July, August timeframe and that tends to be beneficial. As we get into the later part of the year, we like to have called the weather relatively early in the fourth quarter to generate some of the winter good sales. So that\u2019s generally the way that we look at the year. As we go into this year, making year over year and our statement that it\u2019s more normalized, we are looking at spring that\u2019s coming in the standard period of late March and April, which we did not have in the last time. And as we stated last year as we went through the weather, we felt that at times when you have that late spring you will miss some sales, you will pick them up later on, but you may not recapture all of the sales. So as we move through the year, we\u2019re very optimistic that with this earlier spring onslaught that we can continue to drive sales throughout the second quarter. And as we move into the third quarter, as Steve as indicated earlier, it\u2019s just a little too early to call if the early spring will mean a shortened tail compared to last year. But again we are relatively optimistic when we look at the weather patterns. Michael Lasser : And then I want to circle back to the question that was asked earlier and I think there was so much detail provided on the performance of the stores in the energy producing areas, are you seeing any variability in those stores versus others? Steve Barbarick : When we look at the total energy-related, so that includes oil down in the Southwest as well as some of the fracing territories, we compare those to sister stores and we do not see any significant reduction in the performance of those stores. As we carve out a much smaller group of stores relative to more Midwest and Mid Central fracing areas, we see just a slight decline, but again we see overall positive comp store sales across the board relative to that portfolio of oil/fracing stores. Michael Lasser : Just to clear, so if you take out the North Dakota, Pennsylvania and just look at Texas, that\u2019s where you see a little bit weaker performance just in the Texas area, is that\u2026? Steve Barbarick : Actually the opposite. And the issue is when it comes to the fracing stores, obviously we had strong comps in those stores overall. And as we continue forward, we continue to see positive comp in those stores even on a two-year stack. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take a next question from Stephen Knoll with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Knoll : I wanted to just follow up on the discussion around the impact of transport on gross margin, are really able to tell us if these were unchanged year-on-year what the impact would have been on grosses? Anthony Crudele : Can you rephrase that, I\u2019m not sure exactly. Stephen Knoll : Sure. So you said transportation was 5 basis points favorable to gross margin driven by the decline in diesel fuel prices, but if we were to assume that diesel were flat year-on-year, would you have a sense for where you would be just driven by the stem miles in other words? Anthony Crudele : We had anticipated that we would have a negative impact of somewhere between five and 15 basis points. So as we walk through it and looked at our transportation costs, I think they were extremely well-managed during the first quarter and we were able to benefit from the diesel fuel. But I think where you\u2019re trying to go is we\u2019re trying to look at what\u2019s the benefit over the next several quarters if diesel stays where it\u2019s at and I think we will be able to have a benefit, but what you how to take into account is the additional stores that we will be adding and the stem miles that we will be incurring. So I wouldn\u2019t say that net-net you can add 10 to 15 basis points every single quarter. Stephen Knoll : And the five to 15 that you\u2019re planning that assume diesel prices being flat year on year or that\u2019s baked in some assumption for fuel price decline? Anthony Crudele : It baked in some assumption of reduced fuel prices. Stephen Knoll : And then just last question here, you mentioned a new demand planning system, can you frame that a little bit, tell us what exactly is changing and what the impact may be? Gregory Sandfort : Let me tell you, in layman\u2019s terms, what this do for us. The demand planning format will give us a much more accurate way of forecasting forward sales based not just only on current trends and future trends, but it\u2019s reading the sales much more regularly than the other system. The other system that we got in play today is more static. It takes a snapshot pretty much of the sales on a week to week basis and it can\u2019t react as fast. So if we\u2019ve got something that\u2019s trending quickly, something is really selling well, we will see it in our sales, but it won\u2019t be able to \u2013 our system today won\u2019t be able to forecast that trend as it goes forward. The new demand planning system can do that for us and help us. And you can imagine with 18,000 SKUs, many of these being seasonally driven in the spring and in the fall, it\u2019s important to have some eyeballs that are on that from a system standpoint that can give us some more accurate forecasting. So simply put, better forecasting forward, whether it be on promotion or whether it be on a regular price sales on both, what I could call, there will a queue products and our seasonal products. Stephen Knoll : And the timing of that? Gregory Sandfort : We are in the first phase of rollout, it will be at least another year before we are complete with all of the departments and they are being done by division by stages. So it will be the end of 2015, early 2016 before we are complete. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities. Jessica Schoen Mace : My first question is about some of the new stores, when you increased your long-term store target at the analyst day, you mentioned that you found we could put some stores closer together. And I was wondering if you have any results you can share with us from some of those stores opened in higher density areas or closer proximity? Lee Downing : I don\u2019t know there was anything specific for you, I will tell you that our new store performance this year has been in line with what we had planned and those stores that are open closer to others are performing in line with our other new stores. So we are very confident and happy in the results that we are having from those stores. So I would say that they are in line with our other new store performance. Jessica Schoen Mace : And then my other question, just wondering if you could give us an update on where you are in the process of regionalization, maybe this has a little bit to do with the demand planning, but it seems like you had a great example of having the right product in the right place for the tune of the difference and the tune of spring in the North and South. Any other opportunities that you can share with us? Steve Barbarick : I will tell you that what we call localization will be an ongoing process or probably in eternity will never be right because things change and customers\u2019 demand change. Earlier in Q4, to give you one example, we recognized a need for western line of apparel in a lot of our southern stores and we added the brand Cinch for example and we put those in a number of stores thus far. We recognized that the productivity of that brand is incremental to what we had previously and that would just be one example of many that I could probably go through and talk about. So the team is focused on localization and see that as one of our four key sales drivers. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : In the prepared comments you talked about the West Coast stores achieving comp sales growth above the chain average. Does that reflect the fact that those stores are younger and therefore had the inherent sales ramp in the early years or does it just reflect that there is less direct competition in that market and there is big demand out West? Lee Downing : I would tell you it\u2019s both of those things, they are performing as our new stores often do which is better than chain average and the western stores, as we said a few times, they typically run above the average of the chain. So I would say both of those things are giving us benefit. Dan Wewer : And given the higher cost out West, when you look at the returns, I know it\u2019s early, but when you look at the returns in those western stores, are they generating sufficiently higher revenues to offset the higher cost structure? Anthony Crudele : It\u2019s very similar to the way we model them out and they hit their pro forma numbers and they give us the expected returns based on a higher sales level and higher cost structure. Dan Wewer : And then Tony I had also a follow up question for you relating to the share buyback program, given the stock is up another 15% year to date, use the outperforming the market as a whole, when you look at your metrics in buying back shares, what does your model say about how active you should be or not be at current levels? Anthony Crudele : As we go into each quarter, we will adjust the model accordingly and then we will set the metrics in 10B5 plan. So as we adjust and obviously as we continue to have the sales increases and bottom line increases, it drives our calculation of the intrinsic stock value. So it will generally keep us in the marketplace throughout. And what the metrics really does is as the stock moves up and down between the metrics, we will adjust the number of shares that we purchase. So philosophically, we like to be in the marketplace, we like to support the stock and we believe that we\u2019re out saying that it\u2019s the time to buy the stock, we want to be in the marketplace along with our investors. Operator : And we will take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin : Greg, in the past you\u2019ve talked about the very small proportion of your customer base that uses [indiscernible] likely less than 10% of revenues and one would certainly infer that these are perhaps the small portion of your business that are commercial customers. We now have very significant deflation for six quarters and counting, how is this small segment of your customer profile performing lately? Gregory Sandfort : To be honest, Alan, what we track it\u2019s not much different. We look at those customers closely than we do the rest of our portfolio, because we have more information on them. Remember, they are primarily still hobby farmers, we can\u2019t identify that they are production people, but they are in our store more regularly. So they truly are the core lifestylers. But we have not seen any drop off, as a matter of fact we talk to them on a more regular basis and we find that the more we do talk to them, the more we can bring them back into the store and their spending habits increase. So very steady. Deflation really hasn\u2019t had much of an impact either way. Alan Rifkin : So no change at all on discretionary versus core products with this small group of your base? Gregory Sandfort : Nothing we\u2019ve seen, no. I know it sounds too good to be true maybe, but it\u2019s true, that\u2019s how it\u2019s working for us. These customers have not changed, they are very steady. Alan Rifkin : Obviously the numbers support that. And one last question if I may, obviously in this quarter it appears that you traded off a higher propensity to clearance in driving the comp, as you think about the dichotomy between those two variables going forward, are you more or less willing in the future to possibly trade margin for comp? Gregory Sandfort : Let me clarify something. I think the comment about clearance is maybe being taken a little bit out of context. We had a more normal clearance cadence this year than we had in last year. We came out of 2014 very, very clean \u2013 or in 2013 into 2014 and this year I would say it was a more normalized clearance cycle. So it really didn\u2019t \u2013 it aided some in the comp, but it wasn\u2019t a major driver of comp. What drove the comp, as Steve had said earlier, was product across the store in many categories and it was how we had our inventories positioned north to south that really helped us drive the business. We are now a national chain, so the assortments in the Northeast can\u2019t look like the assortments in Florida. And we have done a fine job with our inventory management group in planning people to our sort that differently. So clearance had a very insignificant impact and overall probably a little bit a drain on margin, because the year prior we were so clean and we were actually chasing business. So we\u2019re not going to buy comps to drive to buying into clearance sales, that\u2019s not how we operate. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Omair Asif : This is Omair Asif on for Matt. It sounds like Western stores have performed well, but as you think about continued expansion in the West and the severe drought in California and some of the other markets, does it change the return metrics of new stores at all or is it more of a function of shifting the product mix in these markets? Steve Barbarick : I will start with the answer here. I would tell you that we have shifted product mix, we bought into categories we know that are going to be more related to those customers that are living out there, but I would tell you this drought didn\u2019t just happen yesterday. It\u2019s been going on now for, looking at our numbers, a couple of years now. So those stores are still performing, that\u2019s why we continue to see more opportunities upside at West. So again, I would tell you that it\u2019s just a matter of managing the mix and managing the productivity of the stores. Omair Asif : And then just a follow-up, somewhat unrelated here. Can you talk broadly to some of the early responses to both the personalized marketing campaign and then the loyalty program test? Steve Barbarick : I will go ahead and start with the loyalty test. At this point, we\u2019ve got our requirements together, our crack team and IT is working through the process of putting it all together for us and we anticipate doing a test in the second half of this year. So we are up and running, I think we are excited about seeing our customers\u2019 response to the program, but again it will be limited to a number of stores and we will test and learn and from there we will go forward if we think it\u2019s something that\u2019s viable. In terms of personalization, there is a number of activities going on. One of such is email, we had a much better response in Q1 this year with our targeted campaign versus the year prior. And we will continue to do more of that as well as personalization is one of the organization\u2019s key strategic initiatives and we\u2019ve got a team of people working on how we become more connected to our customer base. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Couple of things. Could you just give us a little detail on the timing of the new store vendor support payments that you mentioned in the press release? And then I have a second question. Gregory Sandfort : New store discount, when we open up a store, we have a program we work with the vendors as far as merchandise goes and what it is, it\u2019s really part of the inventory. So when we receive it, we capitalize it and it\u2019s earned over a period of time. So as we have stores open in the latter part of the quarter, it will benefit the following few months. So as we fine-tuned our store opening program last year, we had very limited stores opened in November and December timeframe, whereas the year before we had several stores opened in the late November timeframe. So some of those discounts get amortized into income in the subsequent quarter. So we saw that have a slight impact in Q1 this year. Chuck Cerankosky : So very simple, it's a promotional payment that you don't get until you earn it, is another way to look at it, I guess. In looking at your full range of merchandise that you're moving, can you talk about, a little more specifically about trading up in categories? Do you see evidence when somebody is buying a tractor or a riding mower that they're buying a little more horsepower or a little more Helly Hansen product in the stores where that's sold or a little more Carhartt? Is any of that going on? Steve Barbarick : Very good on the Helly Hansen, yes. So I would tell you that there is some of that that\u2019s taking place and you can see across different categories. I would tell you that in one case particularly, this year we are testing for example a commercial zero turn rider and it retails for nearly $6,000. And as our customers continue to see interest in stepping up, we will continue to test different products to try to accommodate their needs. So that will be just one example, but I could give you numerous examples of where we\u2019re trying to tap into that demand. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. David Magee : I just had a question on the traffic number being so strong. I'm curious if you're seeing, or first of all, who do you think you're taking share from? It seems like the first quarter has been particularly opportunistic with regard to traffic. Who are you taking share from? And also are you seeing any sort of response that you haven't seen in the past? Gregory Sandfort : I would say that number one we focus more on being better season to season, year to year in the offering to the customer. And we do that through a lot of initiatives that you\u2019ve heard about already in the call, whether it\u2019s localization or its timing of flow of product north to south because of weather and so on and so forth, I think we do that far better to do with our logistics sophistication than those who we compete with at the local to regional level. There is some very good competitors out there in the farm store business, don\u2019t think there aren\u2019t. But they don\u2019t have some of the capabilities that we now have as a company. So I think that\u2019s first and foremost. I don\u2019t believe that it is about who we are taking it from, I think what\u2019s happening is the consumer is deciding that we are probably a better place to shop. And I don\u2019t know specifically any particular competitor like to talk to, but we sell a number of products in that store and there is a number of other people who sell a number of those products. So I think the key to buy in Tractor and grow is we make it easier for the customer because we can consolidate that shopping trip under one roof in one store, we\u2019re priced right every day, we are in stock, we have great customer service, we are convenient and you can get in and get out of our stores quickly. I think there\u2019s a lot of variables out there that are playing to our favor. And we said earlier, we\u2019re relentlessly dissatisfied to keep improving and improving our business and our customer interface and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our business. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Lawrence with Stephens. John Lawrence : Steve, would you comment a little bit on the May rollout of Purina and just compare and contrast number of SKUs, et cetera. Several years ago that extension of Purina was pretty positive and is the intention the same? Steve Barbarick : It\u2019s a little different this time, John, and that the first time we went forward with it, it was a completely new brand to the organization and to our customer base. In this case, you are looking at probably somewhere 10 SKUs or so that are meaningful to the customer lifestyle, but a lot of those customers may still be shopping us already, because we do carry the brand. So I wouldn\u2019t expect the impact to be what we saw when we originally launched back and I believe it was 2009. I will tell you though that we are very excited and one of the biggest request we get from our store managers all the time are this brand and the extension of this brand. So if our team members and our customers are telling us, you know what, this could be okay and we\u2019re pretty excited about the launch. John Lawrence : And follow-up: any update on the mixing center project? Steve Barbarick : Mixing centers are go live, as I said, early third quarter. The test that we ran year and a half ago proved positive that we will be testing these two facilities in Texas, more to talk about once we are up and running, John. Operator : We will take our next question Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Chai : So just a big picture question to start with, how are you thinking about wage increases both in terms of the health of your customer and also from a cost perspective? Anthony Crudele : We always want to be out there as far as paying a competitive wage and we think as we analyze it that we\u2019re very competitive in the marketplace. Additionally, we pay all our team members a monthly sales bonus and we think that that is an added incentive and benefit. Additionally, we hire customers and so our team members really enjoy living the lifestyle, they enjoy working with other folks and engaging with them and talking about what they are doing around their farms or out in the field. So we think that we have a significant advantage when it comes to working with our teams. They are very small teams, most stores at 12 to 15 folks, and we do a tremendous job in making sure that they work the expected hours. So again, I think we have significant advantage when it comes to the competitive wages that we pay our team members. Denise Chai : And just going back to the new Purina feed lines, who do you compete with on this? Where are your customers currently going to get these? Steve Barbarick : Purina uses their independent dealers for the most part to get distribution out to the customers. And so it\u2019s been somewhat of a dealer brand up to this point and there may be a few regional and independent farm stores that carry it, but for the most part this is incremental to Tractor Supply. Denise Chai : And just last one, your new store opening this year looks somewhat front loaded. So can you give us a sense of the cadence for the remainder of the year? Steve Barbarick : Yes, when it comes to Q1, it is little bit frontloaded, it will slow down a little bit in Q2. So we anticipate that we will be in somewhat of a normalized cadence relative to last year where we will be about 50% to 55% of the stores will open in the first half which is similar to last year Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Just a couple quick ones. With regard to shrink, I know you said that it was down a little bit because of the comparison was very difficult from last year. But I was curious, is there anything in particular within that that drove the shrink? And also what should we expect as the year progresses? Will it ease a little bit? If you could just remind us of that, that flow. Gregory Sandfort : Joe, as you mentioned, in the prepared remarks we talked about it being a relative to last year and so it\u2019s really more of a cycle against last year\u2019s number. It is not something that\u2019s structural and it was related more to the distribution centers. So as we move forward in the year, we do not expect it to have a significant impact on the gross margin. Joe Feldman : And then just one kind of minor one, but I know you'd kind of touched on the West Coast port a little bit. Can you remind me, I may have missed it, but can you quantify how much that you think the impact was from the West Coast port delays and have we fully cycled it at this point? Steve Barbarick : I would tell you that based on some reporting that we\u2019ve done, it\u2019s relatively insignificant. The team did a really nice job. As we talked about earlier, we bought some product in early because of the Chinese New Year, we rerouted some of the containers along the water to other ports to get some of the access to some of that product. So we think that the impact from the sales line and the profitability line was very minimal. Joe Feldman : And it sounds like the inventory that you managed pretty well and the complexion of it seems to be in pretty good shape. Is it in the right areas, the right spots? Steve Barbarick : At this point we\u2019ve pretty much gotten through all of it, we\u2019ve been able to get us to the distribution network and out to the stores and we\u2019re locked and loaded for the demand. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : Wondering though if you've had potentially your correction of error meeting that you do after each quarter, just given everything that went right this season potentially maybe one or two examples of something that you think you potentially could have done even better. Steve Barbarick : I would tell you we break our correction of error meeting into specific areas of the business and we get the owners of those business to talk to the opportunities. There is plenty of opportunities, we look forward for perfect, I would tell you in some cases we ran low or out of product where we could have been better in stock and we disappointed some customers. We know what those categories are and we got a plan to fix that for next year. And I would tell you that across the board there is plenty of opportunities, that\u2019s how I would put it. Adam Sindler : And then just quickly, I did notice a pretty nice increase in payables this quarter relative to some of the past quarters. Anything different there, just maybe potentially with the timing of the new store vendor support payments or\u2026 Anthony Crudele : You shouldn\u2019t see any significant difference as we move forward through the course of the year. Operator : And we will take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My question is around your comp average ticket trends. They seem to have slowed a little bit sequentially in terms of year-over-year growth. Just trying to get a sense of whether there's something specific behind that that you can pinpoint and your outlook for comp average ticket growth for the balance of the year. Anthony Crudele : Seth, as we talked about in various different quarters, the comp ticket can be affected significantly by the big ticket purchases. Additionally, things that we mentioned just in this quarter where we had some bulk purchases in the fencing category, so there can be several different factors that will impact the average ticket. And this quarter in particular, the increase \u2013 we really were very pleased with the increase, because we like to see it coming from items per transaction versus just the ticket. But in this quarter in particular, big ticket did not have an impact at all on the average ticket. And we are also dealing as we have over the last couple of quarters with deflation. So between big ticket not having an impact and the deflation coming with a 80 basis point increase in the average ticket, we are extremely pleased. Seth Basham : And as it relates to big ticket specifically, understand the headwinds from safes and some strength in lawn mowers, but when will that safe headwind dissipate and how do you expect big ticket to benefit or not going forward? Gregory Sandfort : Let me just respond to that, because I get that question all the time internally as well. I would go as far as to say that we are still continuing to cycle some decreases from a year ago. The team is looking at where the lines from across on safes, we\u2019ve got renewed energy and are playing around that, but I don\u2019t \u2013 it will continue to diminish as a headwind. I will say that way. Thus far, we are still very cautiously optimistic as we go into the second quarter about big ticket. Some of that may be seasonal, some of that may be discretionary, but we are cautiously optimistic as we move into this quarter based on some of the early learnings in April. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now pass the call back to Greg Sandfort with any additional or closing remarks. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, operator. And thank you all for your interest and support of Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking to you again in July regarding our second quarter performance. Operator : This does conclude the presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Lee Downing will not be joining us today. He is out attending a trade show. We had a solid second quarter and we are pleased with the continued sales trends in our business. Our merchandise planning, inventory and store teams did an excellent job of managing both product assortments and other things to deliver, both a strong sales and earnings performance for the quarter. Comparable store sales increased 5.6% and the increase was distributed across all of our major merchandise categories and geographic regions. We also saw growth in both traffic and ticket. Transaction counts increased 4.1% and average ticket improved 140 basis points in the quarter. And this was our 29th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. Seasonal, big ticket and C.U.E. items all performed well in the quarter and benefitted from merchandised resets and planogram updates. As we have discussed many times, we are a test and learn company and we are constantly evaluating and updating our product assortments to meet the needs of our customers. This year, we made some notable changes to several categories. In pet food and feed, we upgraded and expanded our assortments of premium products in equine and livestock and we added showpiece. In outdoor power equipment, we revamped with new products from Cub Cadet and Bad Boy and we introduced for the first time higher end commercial grade products in outdoor power equipment in a number of select stores. And in towing and trailer, we increased our assortment of heavy duty products and added new steel and aluminum trailers to a select number of stores. And finally in outdoor recreation, we expanded our assortment in utility and recreational vehicles. These changes to our assortment products demonstrate our culture of continuous improvement as part of our ongoing merch strategy. We are always testing new products and upgrading our assortments across the store to strengthen our position as the most dependable supplier of everyday basic merchandise needs for the rural lifestyle consumer. On the gross margin side of our business, strong execution of our price and inventory management strategies contributed to a healthy increase in overall product margins. Investments in new systems such as demand planning, inventory allocation and price optimization are enabling us to shorten the supply chain turnaround time and improve our global management of inventory. In regards to stores, we continue to refine our payroll allocation which we believe is allowing us to better serve our customers at peak selling periods. And while some of this resulted in higher expenses in the quarter, we remain committed to investing in the people and systems necessary to drive profitable growth over the longer term. Now, to update you on our omni-channel business. Last week, we launched a new and completely redesigned website. The updated site offers many enhancements to improve our customers\u2019 browsing and shopping experience. It is a responsive design that delivers the same shopping experience across all mobile devices and has improved our overall search and checkout capabilities as well as added more robust product descriptions, customer reviews and social media tie-ins. In regards to our supply chain activity, construction of our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona is on schedule and under budget and is expected to be operational late in the fourth quarter of this year. The two mixing centers in Texas are also scheduled to open in the third quarter of this year. We opened 17 new stores in the second quarter and remain on track to open 110 to 115 new tractor supply stores in 2015. Our western expansion continues to be a key initiative and our stores that have opened in that area over the past few years continue to comp favorably against our chain average. Looking ahead, we are pleased with our first-half performance and we feel positive about our positioning for the back half for the year. Along with some of the assortment changes I spoke to earlier, we continue to make strategic investments in key businesses that are important and relevant to our customers. And as a result, we made the decision to take early receipt on several categories of products that we believe will benefit our late summer and early fall selling season. Now let me close by thanking all of our dedicated team members across the country and all our store locations and our facilities that go the country mile for our customers each and every day. And for everyone else on the call today, we appreciate your time and interest in Tractor Supply. I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter financials. Tony? Tony Crudele : Thanks Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 27, 2015 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 11.9% to $1.77 billion, net income grew 14.9% to $153 million and EPS increase 17.9% to $1.12 per diluted share. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our sales performance and our gross margin management during our strongest selling season. Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the second quarter compared to an increase of 1.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Comp store sales were strong across all three months of the quarter, with April and May benefitting from favorable seasonal weather and easier comparison. June also posted a solid comp, but faced tougher comparison given the back-end weighted promotional cadence of last year\u2019s second quarter. Sales were strong across all regions, with the strongest regions being the South Central and the West. Wet spring season in Texas area benefitted comps in the South Central region. Our new stores in the Western region continue to produce above chain average comp sales as they gain market awareness and share. Comp transaction count increased for the 29th consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of the 2.3% increase last year. Sales growth continue to be broad based as spring and year-round categories performed well. Two items such as pet food and lubricants continue to post solid comps. Key spring seasonal categories such as riding lawn mowers, trailers, and lawn and garden, and other the year-round categories such as outdoor recreation and rubber footwear performed very well. Average comp ticket increased by 130 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 30 basis-point decrease. Big ticket was the principal driver of the average ticket increase. Comparable sales of the big ticket items were well above the company\u2019s average for the quarter as big ticket items such as riding lawn mowers, trailers and utility vehicles all performed well. This increase was partially offset by deflation which we estimate at 20 basis points and was less than our expectation. The deflation was driven principally by livestock feed. Now turning to gross margin which increased approximately 50 basis points to 35.3% compared to flat last year. Although we had an easier comparison, our direct product margin was bolstered by strong price and markdown management which was facilitated by the strong sales throughout the quarter. Price management tools helped us optimize our retail pricing while negotiating lower cost in some of the deflationary categories. We believe that our gross margin and system initiatives are providing our team with better tools to drive gross margin enhancement and benefitted the quarter. Freight was favorable to 20 basis points, which was a direct result of the lower vehicle prices. The very favorable fuel price more than offset the 10 miles increase from our Western store expansion. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin, this is much less impactful than the previous quarters as deflation has begun to moderate. Our gross margin improvement was even more notable as we overcame a negative mix variance of approximately 20 basis points. Strength in big ticket items which tend to carry below average gross margin was a primary driver of the negative mix impact Import purchases in the quarter increased 18.5% and represent 11.4% of sales mix. Also exclusive brand sales increased 9.8% compared to last year\u2019s Q2 and was approximately 30% of sales. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales was essentially flat compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors. Incentive compensation had a deleveraging impact of 20 basis points as incentive compensation increased year-over-year based on the strong results of the quarter. We did allocate more payroll hours to our stores in our order to capitalize on the selling season and therefore we did not obtain the leverage we normally would receive with such a strong comp sales increase. We also experienced slightly higher payroll and rent deleveraging from new stores as they ran to maturity. This was more notable in the Western store base as we have opened over 50 stores in the past year and they generally open with a higher rent to sales ratio. The expansion of our Hagerstown DC in Q1 added incremental expense to SG&A, but we realized the cost benefits of lowers stem mile in gross margin. Our effective income tax rate increased 37.2% in Q2 compared to 36.7% last year, resulting from the availability of state tax incentives related to the construction of our store support center last year. Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2, this year and last year, we had a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt. During the second quarter under effective purchase program, we acquired approximately 876,000 shares for $76.6 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program for the quarter did not have a material impact on EPS. Average inventory levels for store increased 4.1% compared to a 3.4% decrease in last year\u2019s second quarter and inventory turns were flat compared to last year. As Greg mentioned, we made some strategic investment in key categories and took early delivery on some products to better position ourselves for the late summer and early fall season. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter and we expect a normal seasonal markdown cadence. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48.2 million compared to $40.2 million last year. We opened 17 stores and closed one Del store in the second quarter compared to 23 new stores opened in the second quarter of 2014. The CapEx increase relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest distribution center which were higher than the expenditures on our store to support center which was under construction last year at this time. Now looking ahead, as a result of our strong performance in the first half and as noted in today\u2019s press release, we have revised our financial expectations for the full year 2015. We now expect full year sales to range from $6.25 billion to $6.33 billion. Correspondingly, comp sales are forecasted to increase between 3.5% and 4.5%. We have increased our EBIT margin target and are forecasting 15 to 20 basis-point improvement compared to 2014. We now anticipate net income to range from approximately $412 million to $422 million, or $3 to $3.08 per diluted share. We have decreased our capital expenditure forecast for full year 2015 to a range of $220 million to $230 million. Additionally, we still anticipate that the full year tax rate will be approximately 37%. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $137 million to $137.5 million. With respect to sales, we had anticipated that the first half of the year would have stronger comps than the back half as we\u2019re cycling stronger comp sales in the back half of the year. With high moister levels and mild summer temperatures, we are optimistic that the seasonal demand pattern for the third quarter will be consistent with the past two years and we will see an extended spring and summer selling season. Despite a difficult comparison to last year, comp sales through the first three weeks of July have been positive and are in line with our expectations. We continue to expect deflation in the back half but it has moderated more than we originally expected. We expect it to range between 30 basis points and flat, moderating as we progress through the back half of the year. We will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect a flat to slight improvement in EBIT margin driven by improved gross margin in both quarters. Our gross margin initiatives continue to drive improvement in merchandise margin and lower diesel prices should benefit freight transportation, more than our original assumption. We expect SG&A will run slightly higher than our original forecast and will offset the majority of the gross margin benefit in the back half. We expect SG&A to run approximately 10% to 10.5% increase over last year\u2019s back half. The key elements driving the incremental increase in our SG&A run rate include expenditures on system enhancement such as inventory allocation omni-channel, CRM and system security, additional store payroll hours consistent with the allocation we saw in the first half, rental leveraging resulting from the increased mix of new Western stores which have a higher rent to sales ratio as they ramp to maturity, and preopening expenses for our Southwest D.C. as well as the two mixing centers we plan to open in the second half. We\u2019re off to a strong start to the year and the team has done a great job of capitalizing on the spring season. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing the chain while delivering mid teens EPS increases over the long-term. So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go to our first questioner now, Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray. Jon Berg : This is actually Jon Berg on for Peter and congrats on the nice quarter. Just on the first question on the sustainability around the big ticket, I think you guys say comp ticket was up 1.3% which is I think five consecutive quarters now of positive comp growth. So, I guess under this context, does it seem that big ticket items are making a comeback such that there might be some sustainability as we look out to 2016 even with the tougher compares? Steve Barbarick : This is Steve Barbarick. Couple of comments on big ticket, where we made changes and I think Greg noted mowers, trailers and a couple other categories like ETBs. We saw a nice impact in our business because our customers are looking for value. And when we change things we see a pretty good return. We did have categories however that fall into the big ticket I guess area that didn\u2019t perform quite as well. So while we saw a benefit in Q2, I would say that we\u2019re still cautiously optimistic and we\u2019re not going to declare victory at this point but we like what we\u2019re seeing. Jon Berg : And then, as far as the impact of clearance optimization, with your gross margin up like 50 basis points and I think you cited markdown management as the driver. Are you beginning to see the early benefits of your clearance optimization software and if that is the case, are there any examples you can provide on how that clearance activity was better managed in the second quarter? Greg Sandfort : The optimization on clearance is only in a select number of departments today, so it\u2019s not across all buying divisions yet. But in some areas particularly in seasonal and some of the lawn and garden, the systems have helped us enormously I would say to look at the sales trends, act appropriately and there is always, my belief that the first markdown is always the least expensive and the customer can brought to the side counter and make a purchase, typically if you\u2019re seeing some slowness in the category. So I think that the systems absolutely did help us this spring but again they\u2019re only -- it\u2019s only rolled out in certain divisions, we still have the rest of the company roll out to the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : First question, there seems to be a lot of concern around the seasonal out there in the market right now. And you guys obviously did very well in seasonal businesses, both the small ticket lawn and garden but also the larger ticket OPE. And it sounds like it was pretty consistent across the months; you said June was a little softer because you\u2019d done some promoting last year. So, I guess, I don\u2019t know, Steve, was this just a solid seasonal quarter? And do you think you guys just were taking a lot of share or do you think it -- because there was some concern about like tax with the heavy rains et cetera. So, maybe a little more color on just the seasonal business would be great. Thank you. Steve Barbarick : We did go into the season really prepared and we\u2019re using inventory as a strategic lever to drive sales and take share. In terms of some of the changes we made, we worked with our vendor partners and we upgraded the specifications in a lot of the lines and using OPE as an example. With MTD for example, we upgraded the design frames and the engines and our customers voted for a lot of the categories where we made those changes. So, we were really pleased there. In terms of live goods, we\u2019re getting better at what we\u2019re doing today out in the marketplace and being more regionalized and localized. So, I would tell you, we talked about Tractor Supply and our ability to be nimble, and I think this was a really good case study in how we\u2019re able to manage through the season. Peter Benedict : And then my next question would just be around the level of investment expense that you\u2019re kind of stomaching right now on some of these systems. In 2Q, I think Tony called it out as one of the pressure points in SG&A. Can you give us a sense for maybe how much larger the expense hits were maybe this quarter versus a year ago around the system? And then just maybe map out a little bit of the payback cadence from some of the larger more meaningful systems you\u2019ve got coming, the demand planning omni-channel taking some of the D.C. stuff, that\u2019s what comes to mind. Tony Crudele : When we look at the investment that we\u2019re making, again we\u2019re doing our best to be methodical in how we allocate our capital. And so there was definitely a slight uptick but overall, it was really several items that impacted the expense structure in the quarter. As we mentioned, we talked a little bit about the payroll, the stores coming on board. So when it comes to the pure investment piece as we improve our systems, as we\u2019ve noted in the past, we have that investment; it\u2019s somewhat in the run rate, there was a slight uptick in the quarter but not overly significant. As we look in the back half of the year, we do have some additional investments coming forward. But again, we believe that it\u2019s something that we can absorb in the run rate as we move forward. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Hiram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Cody Ross : This is Cody Ross on for Am Rubinson today. How are you? Just a quick question regarding your supply chain. Once the West Coast D.C. is up and running at the end of this year, can we expect GMs to expand faster than the 20-25 bps that you guys had forecasted out previously? Greg Sandfort : I would tell you that today we are seeing some deleveraging because of stem miles. As we open that facility, we will see some leverage from transportation, but you\u2019ve got other expenses; now, I\u2019ve got an overhead cost of a new building. So to be honest with you, the way we planned it is to be somewhat of an offset for now and then we\u2019ll learn, as time progresses I think we can have some average but it would be hard to forecast that today. Cody Ross : And then just a quick update. Can you guys update us on where you stand with your royalty program and some of the capabilities you expect to have and hope to have down the line. Steve Barbarick : In the back half of Q3, September, we\u2019ll be piloting our program. And I think we\u2019ve mentioned it will be in three markets. What we\u2019re looking at is a program that will have both soft and hard rewards and it will give us a chance to understand what our customers are looking at from Tractor Supply for rewards program. So, at this point, we are not really getting into a lot of the specifics. We\u2019re still working through some of the infrastructure needs that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ll be training our team members that will be in those pilot stores here shortly and more of them likely in the next call will be able to give you all at least a little more insight as to how that program is working. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : One follow-up on gross margin Tony; thanks for some of the color on the buckets. Can you tell us I guess looking back on the promotional side? You said it was an easier comparison. How much I guess was it easier comparison cycling, either promotions or items that were sold I guess below at full margin a year ago, how much of that contributed 50 basis points? Tony Crudele : If you remember last year when we talked about the second quarter, in June, we had some sort of in-store selling promotions. They were somewhat limited and the impact on gross margin really was only a few basis points, relative to this quarter. Simeon Gutman : And then my follow-up on traffic, the 4% which I think is among the best in our space maybe across retail. Can you tell us how that compares, is that pretty uniform across the chain, or are you seeing mature stores versus immature stores? And then your customer frequency, are you seeing the same customer visit you more often or what is it or the other side of it is I guess, how are new customers or new customer acquisition trending? Greg Sandfort : Clearly as we\u2019ve talked in the past, the newer stores will have a little bit higher transaction increase but we are seeing that there is a positive transaction increase across the chain in all maturity levels of the stores. So, as we move forward, we see that this is coming, both from increased number of visits from our current customers as well as new customers coming on board. Simeon Gutman : If I can just follow up on that though, if you think about a waterfall, immature stores should be counting better, the presumption is that they should be driving better traffic. Is that the case or you\u2019re seeing some of the mature stores drive just as good traffic as some of the immature stores? Tony Crudele : On an overall basis, the new stores definitely drive more transactions than the more mature stores. But we do see in different areas of the country as well as in stores that may have been renovated pr running certain tests, we\u2019ll see an uptick in comps that may be very comparable to some of the newer stores. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : I wanted to ask about the Purina expansion in the quarter; any early commentary there and any sense on how incremental the customer you\u2019re getting into the store and how we should be thinking about the ramp in the second half of the year? Steve Barbarick : I\u2019d tell you that the launch of the new Purina SKUs is really the way I look at and what I told my team is it\u2019s really part of overall C.U.E strategy. What I can tell you is the SKUs that we added from Purina are C&D SKUs; we took the A&B SKUs originally when we launched in 2009. So, these SKUs are having in the impact in the rounding out the assortment hence really building some I guess credibility with our customers. There is some incrementality to it but it\u2019s not material to the top line. Seth Sigman : And then just more broadly as you look at the second half comparisons, when you drill down last year you had a great second half from the ticket perspective. You talked little bit about big ticket and the potential for that continuing in the back half, but besides that anything else you can point to that should help to navigate the more difficult comparisons? I know in the past you talked a little bit gun safes and the headwind there. Is that something that\u2019s easing any other drivers there? Steve Barbarick : I will say that the safe business was a headwind, a pretty significant headwind this past year and we are starting to see that moderate a little bit. I think you\u2019ve heard Tony talk a little bit about deflation and that moderating versus maybe what we\u2019re up against some last year to some extent. We are making some strategic inventory investments. And as we talked about before, we want to be a dependable supplier of basic maintenance need. So, we will be putting inventory in the key categories to drive some sales and make sure we\u2019re not going to disappoint our customers. So there is a variety of things that we\u2019re doing. We always talk about not having a silver bullet, a lot of BBs [ph] out there. And I will tell you the test and learn approach that we\u2019ve used up to this point has been working and you will likely see some new things in the store if you go visit this next quarter. Operator : We will go next to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : A couple of questions if I could, first is on the payroll hours, if you could just talk. So, this is something I guess we really haven\u2019t seen before but as we sort of think about how your test. Is this a test, is this something that we\u2019re rolling out, is this something that\u2019s sort of one-time and then you will start to leverage it as we go through next year? But just maybe a little more color on what the increase in store labor was and then how you are thinking about that going forward? Greg Sandfort : Here is the difference. A year ago in the second quarter, we had talked about how business had been a bit sluggish. And we were really watching cost and payroll and so and so forth. So we really turned it back a bit until the sales started to come late second into third quarter. This year, we saw a more normalized second quarter and we felt as if it was prudent to go ahead and leave the payroll as we had planned and in some instances we added some payroll to take advantage of the sales trends and the customer transactions. So, that\u2019s what the basic difference. If you compare year-to-year, it\u2019s kind of an odd comparison because the seasons were very, very different. Adam Sindler : So, as we look at the third quarter then, with the third quarter having the extended selling season last year, should we look for a little bit more normalized labor in the third and fourth quarters? Greg Sandfort : Yes, I believe so. And I think it would be very comparable to a year ago. Adam Sindler : And just as we think about the third quarter, can you just remind us about the cadence last year, sort of the July, August, September, how those months comps? Tony Crudele : Sure, this is Tony. We generally don\u2019t give specifics on the months but I will tell you that the months were very consistent relative to the overall comp for the quarter last year. Operator : We will go next to Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : On your expectations for the back half of the year, may be you can -- the comp here [ph] is a little confusing, you mentioned flat. Maybe you can provide a little bit more -- clearer picture of how you are thinking about the breakdown between the third and the fourth quarter on a comp perspective? Tony Crudele : As is our standard, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance and we provide full year guidance. So, the overall comment is that we expect that the full year comp will be between 3.5% and 4.5%. Obviously running a 5.5%, there is clearly a range for the back half that obviously -- it\u2019s up to you guys and your modeling to determine. But we feel very comfortable within that 3.5% to 4.5% range on a full year basis. Michael Lasser : And maybe you could just give us some of the puts takes on what sort of pushed you towards the higher end of the range and what sort of pushed you towards the lower end of the range. So, is it going to be heavily weather dependent or is the back half a little less influenced by the weather than the first half of the year? Tony Crudele : Well generally, the back half is less influenced by weather than the first half of the year. I would say as we look out into the second half, sort of that extended spring summer consistent with last year will be critical to third quarter. And as in the past, the earlier we have a nice cool seasonal winter coming on board that generally drives some of the heating product and some of the winter product and insulated outerwear and that tends to be the main driver in the fourth quarter as well. Michael Lasser : And my last question is on the West Coast stores. In the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that they\u2019re higher volume but it sounds like they are also now faster growing. So is that pretty consistent quarter in quarter out or you are seeing an acceleration at this point? Tony Crudele : I would answer that it\u2019s been relatively consistent. What we\u2019ve seen is that we will have a slightly higher sales volume and the ramp will be generally consistent with a new store. However we will have some acceleration because they tend to be a little bit of a higher volume store. What we\u2019ve seen and the point we\u2019re making in the comments was that generally in modeling the West stores, we will have a higher rent to sales relationship or ratio in the first couple of years of that store\u2019s growth. And then as we continue to ramp because they are a little bit higher in sales volume, then we will start to get the leverage that we expect out of the Western stores. So, slightly different ramp than the rest of the chain but for the most part, consistent with our new store performance. Operator : We will go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : I wanted to focus a little bit on gross margin and just sort of understand kind of what really contributed what. I mean the price management and markdown management, can you talk a little bit about those maybe independently, maybe not to the extent that they are related and kind of frame and relative to the overall increase year-on-year? Tony Crudele : We tend not to give too much detail relative to each factor when it comes to gross margin because many of these factors interrelate and so it\u2019s hard to call it out each one. We gave somewhat specifics on the fuel component which was a major driver. So, we can carve that out pretty well, so it was around the 20 basis-point mark. Then when it comes to price management and deflation, again that\u2019s very difficult to sort of parse those two pieces out. Now, what we did see is that as we\u2019ve had some cost decreases, we have been able to manage our retail prices very effectively. And so, a good portion of that increase in margin is really related to price management component. So, if you wanted me to outline the two big drivers, I would say is the fuel component and the price management piece was the two principal drivers of the margin improvement. Stephen Tanal : I was sort of thinking about back half and what it could like, specifically clearance optimization is one thing I was thinking about and you noted the big benefit it\u2019s had in seasonal and garden. And then I am wondering what are the categories are -- said another way, will all categories be kind of on that program by year-end; is that the right timing for this? And maybe you could help us sort of think about kind of the relative impact in the quarter versus what\u2019s still to come on that initiative? Steve Barbarick : I would tell you that we\u2019re still rolling this program out and we\u2019re still going through a season right now. So, a lot of the categories that we put in to our clearance price optimization tool are spring related categories. And what we saw was the system said, we be better off taking some early marks in a number of these categories because we think we could see some benefit on the back side. But we haven\u2019t yet got to the full season yet to see this all way through. That\u2019s the way the tool is designed. So rather than in the past where we were taking more global markdowns, these markdowns are taken as a site level based on sales rate and inventory levels. So we do think that there\u2019s going to be some nice benefit, but until we get to the season, that would be hard for us to put too much into this. We\u2019ll be able to communicate better probably at the end of next quarter and share with you what we experienced here in spring. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark Miller : One of the things that\u2019s most impressive to me about Tractor Supply is the diversification of gross margin drivers and from semester to semester, it\u2019s shifting and obviously the price and markdown optimization here. But I was hoping you can talk a little bit about what\u2019s coming with the demand planning system, the timing of when we might begin to see those benefits kick-in and how we can dimensionalize the size of that potential opportunity? Greg Sandfort : Let me talk to this a little bit. Demand planning is a roll out over really the next year, year and a half and its basic component is to help us looking forward demand for product whether it would be at regular price selling or at promotional price selling. And instead of us having kind of what I would call these peaks and valleys with inventory, it\u2019s looking out forcing us -- and forcing the system to say, we -- it estimates x amount of demand is coming because it knows more, it\u2019s -- the inputs that go into this are different than the inputs that go into E3 which is somewhat of a basic kind of a static replenishment system. This is much more sophisticated than anything we\u2019ve had. We are learning right now. We\u2019ve had several departments that have been turned on. So far we\u2019re seeing fairly good results. We\u2019re bringing inventory levels down and we\u2019re seeing some positive comp sales in those categories over their comparison store groups. So like-stores-to-like-stores we\u2019re seeing improvement. But it is a -- it\u2019s truly a test and learn process over the next 18 months but very encouraged with the initial reporting that\u2019s coming from it. Mark Miller : So where the organization could see the biggest uplift it sounds like through next year, but really \u201817, \u201818 potentially? Greg Sandfort : Well, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a maturing process. So yes, I would say it\u2019s a good year out before we\u2019re really going to see a lot of the benefit. Mark Miller : And then on the exclusive products, you\u2019ve had tremendous success there historically; it looks like its plateaued recently, but some of that is because you\u2019re getting such strong sales elsewhere, so I mean big ticket and other. But what are the top priorities for exclusive products going forward? Steve Barbarick : Exclusive brands continue to be a focus for us. Part of what you\u2019re seeing in the top-line numbers is a bit of a byproduct of deflation. So, we\u2019re still seeing nice growth there, but as our costs have come down in some of our key businesses, we\u2019re not getting necessarily the benefit on the top-line and therefore the mix is changed. So, I would tell you the engine is still running. And what you\u2019re seeing in the margin line, some of that is a byproduct of full deflation and what we\u2019re doing as far as bringing more products into the exclusive brand family. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Tony, it seems like you guys have accelerated your reset activity over the last certainly several quarters and it sounds like they\u2019re generating very good results. Can you give us some additional color on the difference in sales performance between categories, in general I guess but between categories that have been reset or re-merchandised and those that may not have been touched quite as much? Steve Barbarick : What I can tell you is as I\u2019ve been with the company, this is my I guess 17th, 18th year and we\u2019ve always been a company that\u2019s focused on resetting merchandise and bringing new things into the center core of our stores. I will say that we continue to put different levels of scrutiny on the reset activity we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re using a tactics model going back to little bit of the data or science driven part of our business. Where we do resets they vary. In some cases, we\u2019ll do resets to bring new products in or we\u2019ll try to keep our assortments fresh; other cases, it maybe to leverage cost because of multisource products out there. So, it\u2019s really hard to say specifically when you do a reset that they all are going to give you 10% comp sales increases. But what I can say, they vary dramatically. And generally speaking, we see a nice comp as a result of the activity that we do. That\u2019s why we keep doing it. Scot Ciccarelli : And you guys have certainly emphasized that in various categories this is what changed; this is why we re-merchandised, you got a nice flip from it. Is there any way to provide it and maybe there is and maybe there isn\u2019t, maybe the results are just too bad? Steve Barbarick : Well, you have to understand, a large part of the store gets reset. And as a byproduct of that, it varies by category. So we talk winches before and the winch line has performed really significantly well. We\u2019ve recently looked at our power tool assortment and expanded a line in the vault and we think that our customers will respond favorably and the initial read looks that they will. And I could go into the pet food line where we expanded premium categories such as Blue Buffalo and others. So, it\u2019s really different by category but I can tell you, we\u2019re putting more scrutiny into the work that goes into the reset and making sure that we\u2019re trying to bring cost down while bringing good quality products and value to our consumers and they seem to be responding favorably that\u2019s probably the best I can answer to that. Scot Ciccarelli : And then just a quick, hopefully it\u2019s a quick question. We have heard about incremental sales challenges from a lot of retailers around energy intensive market, I don\u2019t think you guys mentioned anything that on the call and obviously it didn\u2019t seem to impact the total top line. But I would think a bunch of your products would be susceptible to the slowdown in some of these oil and gas markets. Have you seen any of that kind of impact? Steve Barbarick : What I can tell you is, in those oil drilling store specifically and again you have to remember there just part of a much bigger chain of stores. And those subset of stores, there are some categories that you are seeing comp sales declines in. We\u2019ve seen them in truck boxes and fuel handling, we\u2019ve got local assortments for these stores in fire retardant apparel and those are seeing some declines. But if you look at the total store, we\u2019re a needs based retailer and we carry so many more products than those areas that just relate to oil that we\u2019re seeing nice comp store sales in those stores themselves. So, it\u2019s not material to the top line at this point, you can see that in overall company numbers. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated. Ben Bienvenu : So just quickly on tickets, obviously big ticket sales was a key driver for the higher ticket in the quarter. But did you all -- I\u2019ve been curious to know if you also saw a lift in items per transaction. And if so, what do you think is the driver for this, is it better assortment, healthier customer, what could be factoring into that? Tony Crudele : When we look at the ticket, obviously a substantial portion was driven by big ticket. But we also look on an items per transaction basis. We did have a very nice lift there as well. And again, when you\u2019re dealing with some small numbers and like 3.5 items per transaction, when you move to 3.6 that\u2019s a nice move. So, it\u2019s still a very small number of items per transaction but we did have a nice lift. And I think as you commented, there is just several factors that go on, a lot of what Steve has been talking about as far as our enhanced assortment. We\u2019ve done a great job of making the store more shopable, picking up new products, the operations team get the credit about having items of the month and making sure that they drive that basket. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of several factors and it is something that we continue to focus on. Ben Bienvenu : Secondly, looking to Home Town Pet, are there any learnings there that you\u2019ve seen that could be promising in the Tractor Supply store, anything jump out you there? Greg Sandfort : What I will tell you is that we have two stores up and running; we have been -- we\u2019re about in our ninth month now of operation and we are seeing a little different mix of sales in those stores versus the Tractor, which means that it\u2019s attracting in our opinion little different customer and there are some learnings. I\u2019ll give you one and I won\u2019t speak to too many but I\u2019ll give you one. We have services in these stores that we don\u2019t have in a Tractor Supply and what I mean by that is the grooming salon. The grooming salon has taught us a number of things, one that if a great groomer, they can bring traffic to that store. And unlike other grooming salons, we allow our groomers to step outside the salon, if they find that the animal that they\u2019re grooming has a need for something whether it would be for their coach or they\u2019ve got hot spots whatever, we allow our groomers to go out on the floor and actually suggest to sell to the customer, a product that could be a solution. So, it\u2019s a little more intimate relationship in our store than you may find in other side operations. But that\u2019s an example of something that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re looking and saying to ourselves, \u201chmm, is that something that is potentially an expansion point for Tractor someday?\u201d Operator : We\u2019ll got next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard : I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color, you talked about the early receipt or strategic early receipt of some inventory to be better prepared, it sounds like for the late summer early fall. Just talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re specifically doing there, why you haven\u2019t done it in the past? There\u2019s something that enables you to do it now and what you think the payback from that can be? Steve Barbarick : A couple of things here. I think even I talked a while back about the fact that as an organization we\u2019re going to start using inventory to really help propel sales and to really make us more of a dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs. When we came out of Q2 last year, we were running a comp inventory decrease and this year that increase that you saw partly kind of built back up the hole that we have put ourselves in. But I can tell what we\u2019re bringing in to make sure that we make the right commitment to our customers, will be heating; we\u2019re going to be bringing that in to make sure that we locked and loaded for the season. What we typically find is when there\u2019s a cold winter the season before, customers tend to want to get out early because last year they got caught short and maybe weren\u2019t able to get the goods that they needed. So, no different than we did last year but maybe at a little higher level, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re in the heating business and that includes fuel, making sure that we got our coordinates set when it comes to apparel and everything else laid out. So, we did get some early receipts in, we will be setting our stores here shortly. And when customers come in they\u2019re going to know that we\u2019re ready for the season. We\u2019re going to be there to take care of their needs. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly and I know that you operate across a number of different categories and perhaps even industries, but in as much as you have a feel for market share or a feel for your customers, you feel like your share of wallet is growing at a similar pace to the past or if there\u2019s a change taking place that you\u2019re getting better penetration with your customers gaining market share, any sense on that? Greg Sandfort : Let me make a couple of statements real quick. Number one, the consumer continues to spend their hard earned dollars in the same way. They\u2019re looking for good value, our consumers are continuing to spend on need based products, less discretionary. I would say that with the kind of unit increases that we are experiencing in a number of categories both in C.U.E and in some other seasonal categories, I have to believe that there\u2019s a market share that\u2019s probably shifting to us. But there are so many that it\u2019s very difficult with all these categories to be able to pull some data. The data that we get is basically from our suppliers talking about of how much of their business is coming from Tractor Supply, so the answer there would be, I believe we are getting more share and I think our share of wallet is increasing. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : I was just curious if we are seeing a more sustained shift to big ticket and you didn\u2019t say that. But if that happens, does that drive payroll hours on a more sustained basis, is there more training and assembly and selling that takes place that would more permanently drive payroll hours? Tony Crudele : Seasonally where we would incur the most hours would be in Q2 as we have the spring season. So, as we move forward, it\u2019s less of an impact; big ticket has less of an impact on our payroll allocation. Matt Nemer : And then I guess secondly and maybe this already came up but did you just explain the change in the CapEx guidance for the year. Tony Crudele : No, I did not give the details. Generally, it relates to several factors across the board. We are under budget as Greg has mentioned on our Southwest distribution centre that\u2019s probably the largest piece of the decrease. Some of the IT initiatives are coming in on plan and on the budget as well as some initiatives we may not get to. And so as usual at the beginning of the year, we have little bit greater appetite for some of the key projects but the majority is the result of being under budget on some of the key initiatives that we\u2019ve executed so far this year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to David Magee with SunTrust. David Magee : I had a question regarding some of the resets in terms of the upgrades that you\u2019re showing success with. I\u2019m curious if you think you could have done this years ago or is this a reflection of the economy or the ability to manage with the systems more effectively? Steve Barbarick : I would tell you that it\u2019s probably as much to do with relentlessly satisfaction. We\u2019ve always done resets. We haven\u2019t really talked a whole lot about them on the call. For those of you who attend our IR conference, where we\u2019ve got our sales meeting, you see a lot of the changes that take place with our vendors on the sales floor down there at the convention center. So, I think that this has been an ongoing thing for Tractor Supply. And I think you go back and you look at our traffic count, you look at our comp store sales performance, you\u2019ll see that in a lot of the numbers. We\u2019re just probably today giving more color around some of the changes we\u2019re making. I will say however that when it comes to some maybe more of the commercial product, we are testing more there than we have in the past and it seems to be resonating pretty well with our customers. The higher price points that we have out there right now and how we\u2019re selling those price points, I think are real show of support from our customers and their trust in the Tractor Supply brand and also their trust with the team members that we have in our stores and relationships they\u2019ve built. So, I think we are taking advantage quite frankly of a foundation that\u2019s been built for years and we\u2019ll continue to try and test new things. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Chai : I apologize for the background noise here. You talked about comp sales decrease [ph] the Western stores and the chain average. Is that more a function of just store maturity or is it related to the competitive environment there? Tony Crudele : Denise it really relates more to the maturation cycle of our new stores. We believe that in several of the areas it is very competitive out there. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re extremely pleased with the ramp of the stores out West and sort of that accelerated comp that we\u2019re experiencing with those Western stores. Denise Chai : And recently corn and soy have moved up quite a lot. I just wonder if these prices hold, when you would expect to see those come true in your kind of inflation or deflation numbers. Tony Crudele : We\u2019ll likely see, if these hold and as our costs pick up, we\u2019ll see it start to moderate at the end of Q3 and end of Q4, but again we\u2019re still watching that very closely and our teams are challenged to keep costs down. So we\u2019ll see how good negotiators they are. Denise Chai : And just one more; you talked a lot about the new kind of commercial and professional level tools that you got in to store. Were those contributors to your strong ticket this quarter or is it just kind of too early to see their impact and ticket was more a function of big ticket items? Tony Crudele : I would say that the upgrades that we made when it comes to engines that are in the same size more but by changing the deck style and the frame as well as upgrading the engines, if you want to call that commercial, I guess you could but our customers tend to like things of high quality when they can see value and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to focus on. I\u2019ll use one other quick example and that is as we added 59 99 [ph] commercial zero turnover into a handful of stores and at the beginning of the season we saw it performing really well and we expanded it out to even in more stores and we were delighted with the sales. And to be able to sale $6,000 riding mower in a Tractor Supply Company store something that I wouldn\u2019t have thought we could have done years ago. So there is a need and I think we\u2019re feeling that need in that gap really well. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : I wanted to just ask again another update on the online business. And I know it\u2019s still small and emerging, but are you seeing any deference in customer or what people are purchasing, or how far people are shipping from the store or if there is a demand for pick at store; buy online, pick up the store that kind of thing? Steve Barbarick : We\u2019re seeing a lot of positive signs. So the comp ramp there is far greater than we\u2019ll have in our four wall stores, because it\u2019s still a very immature business, but no question with the new website launch. The reason we did that was to give customers more options. As far as the way to acquire the product, our goal is to do 24/7 Tractor. So in order to do that we had to do the upgrades and give ourselves the ability to have a platform that can handle that. We are adding more and more drop ship vendors as we speak daily. We are seeing very good customer response to those additions and more of our business is coming from that element today than probably I would say direct fulfillment; it\u2019s coming greater than what we\u2019ve seen in just normal replenishment from the Franklin D.C. which is kind of the replenishment point for the online business. So, we are encouraged with that because that\u2019s a direct connection between us and the drop ship from the vendors, so lowest cost for us, little faster delivery for them. But in general, our conversion rates are moving upward, the amount of people that are hitting the website is increasing. We are looking at adding new extensions of products. So, you are going to see this thing develop over the next several years and it\u2019s something that I think can be much more meaningful. However I will caution you, there are a lot of things that we saw at Tractor Supply that would be very difficult to sell online and deliver to customer because of their cost of transportation. So, there will be a point when there is going to be some things it could be somewhat prohibitive but all indications, all signs right now are that this thing is moving ahead well and we are very pleased with our performance. Joe Feldman : And just a quick follow-up on where orders are originating, like are you seeing a big increase in mobile? Obviously you said you guys revamps on the mobile side and\u2026 Greg Sandfort : Mobile is growing very rapidly, Joe. And the consumer who is buying from us is still somewhat within a proximity of our store base. So when I am seeing someone in some distant place and let\u2019s say Alaska trying to buy product on tractorsupply.com that has not been prevalent; it\u2019s been customer that are looking at that as a convenient factor, they can buy at 3 :00 in the morning and then they buy at 6 :00 o\u2019clock in the evening that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying. So, it\u2019s really still somewhat based around the current consumer base, the distance of our stores that\u2019s what the base of business is coming from. Joe Feldman : And if I could sneak one more quick one, As far as new stores and real estate the outlook, are you finding any differences in procuring new sites or cost of rent or the new sites going up at all or anything to note on the real estate front? Greg Sandfort : Well one thing we have noticed and I mentioned it in the write ups, Tony commented it too that it\u2019s a little more expensive to do business in the West, no question that occupancy costs are higher but our retails are different out there and the volume of those stores will be considerably different. So, we are finding plenty of sites, it doesn\u2019t seem to be any concern for finding quality sites. But one thing I should mention is when we open stores, we don\u2019t look at as just opening the all A locations. We will open stores across the spectrum of small, medium and large in volume and in size so that we can continue to see productive store opening improvements over the next decade or so of store growth. So we\u2019re not looking at just A stores, we\u2019re looking at A, Bs and Cs. We are looking at different markets, some larger, some smaller. The mix of stores is just as important as finding a location of that store. Operator : And we will go next to Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities. Jessica Mace : My question was on new customer acquisition. You mentioned some of the learnings from the HomeTown Pet format. And I was just wondering about the process of applying those learnings for the Tractor Supply format as well as any other opportunities you see for increasing business with new customers? Greg Sandfort : Jessica, let me just comment on HTP and I\u2019ll let Steve take it from the other side. In HTP, we can attribute generally all of our customers that are coming through from a purchasing standpoint because it\u2019s a different format; it\u2019s very intimate, they are willing to give us their information so on so forth, little different in Tractor however. Steve Barbarick : Yes, Jessica, what I would tell you is that acquisition of customers is critically important. We talk a lot about the who are non-shopper and we talk a lot about how difficult sometimes it is to get people in our stores that just look at the name Tractor Supply. We have done a lot with our assortments over time. We have done some different things with our marketing and how we target different areas. So, I would tell you that we\u2019re making good strides. I would tell you by the top transaction growth we are continuing to see that in our numbers. And so while there\u2019s more work to be done here, I am pretty pleased with the degree of support that we are getting from our marketing team and bringing new folks in. Jessica Mace : And then just a quick follow up on the performance of the exclusive brands. You mentioned deflation as one of the dynamics that was causing some of the difference in the performance of the exclusive brands versus the remainder of the offering. Is there anything else to think about or may be expectations for the back half? Steve Barbarick : I would tell you deflations had the biggest impact. So whether it would be in our brands like Royal Wing or Bird Seed or some of what you are saying on the livestock feed side of our business, we are selling some good units. We continue to think that we are gaining share. Units are a focus for us but it is difficult when you\u2019re paddling uphill here because the deflation on the top-line. So, it\u2019s still a focus for us as an organization and that\u2019s what I can tell you at this point. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Sandfort for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Sandfort : Thank you for your interest everyone and your support of Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking to you again in October regarding our third quarter performance. Operator : This does conclude the conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Greg Sandfort : Thank you, Christine and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, EVP and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate. We are really pleased with the overall performance of our business in third quarter. From a top line perspective we face our most difficult comparison of the year in this quarter. If you recall, an extended spring-summer selling season combined with earlier cold weather made for a solid third quarter in each of the past two years. Our teams did an excellent job of positioning the business for both top and bottom line growth in the quarter with comparable sales increasing 2.9% and earnings per share increasing 16%. Comp store sales growth was driven by strength in everyday in spring-summer seasonal category with consumable, usable and edible items such as pet food and supplies and livestock continuing to perform well in the quarter. Even though the spring-summer seasonal business started earlier this year, we did see a modest tailwind to categories in this business into the third quarter that resulted in solid sales of items such as trailers, fencing and outdoor recreation products. We did not experience early demand for cold weather seasonal items as in the previous two years. This primarily impacted the sale of fuel and heating related products such as wood pellets, logs splitters, indoor fireplaces and wood burning stoves. We understand that our customers purchase these items based primarily on need and as the winter season progresses we expect this business to improve. We obviously cannot predict weather but it is our job to be ready for our customers with the right assortments of cold weather seasonal products when the demand arises and we will be ready. Last quarter we discussed a number of merchandise resets as part of our test and learn continuous improvement culture. We continue to use PoS and planogram data along with store, customer and vendor research to refine and improve our store assortments. We are committed to ongoing merchandise improvements and with the exception of heavy winter related items, all of our major departments continue to contribute positive sales in the quarter. In September, we held annual Pet Appreciation Week or PAW event. This is a week-along event in all of our stores and online. This centers around pet adoption and pet health. We partner with local agencies and community groups to promote pet adoptions and this year's event resulted in nearly 2500 pet adoptions across our store base. Additionally, we continued to improve the event through extensive digital support including the third Annual Rescue Your Rescue contest to fund animal shelters. Pet and animal related products are important and growing portion of our business and the PAW event is just another way we drive sales, support and awareness at the local level. And this year's event was another success and continues to position Tractor Supply as a leading authority in pet food and pet care. Also this month we launched Flocktoberfest, a new event in stores and also online. This is a month long celebration featuring our feathered friends in our poultry and wild bird categories. In conjunction with the event, we launched a new line of premium wild bird seed labeled totaled care as a sub-brand under our exclusive brand of Royal Wing brand bird products. As always here at TSC, we continue to test and learn from our customers utilizing new product introductions and extensions. This program is just another example of this successful strategy in motion. In the quarter we also began a test of our customer loyalty program, Neighbors Club, in approximately 140 stores. We ask our customers to provide their contact information at checkout and opt in to receive special promotions and updates on merchandise and in-store related events. As with everything we do, we will be measured and disciplined in our testing and eventual rollout of this program. We have a strong and loyal customer base at Tractor Supply and we are excited to learn more about their preferences and shopping needs through our Neighbors Club program. Initial feedback and enrollment rates from the customers we have seen thus far are promising. As I mentioned last quarter, we launched a new and completely redesigned Web site. The new Web site is a more responsive design that delivers the same shopping experience across all mobile devices. The site improves search and checkout capability and provides better product descriptions, customer reviews and social media tie-ins. We continue to increase the merchandise offerings on our site and now have over 125 vendors in our drop ship program. During the third quarter we opened our first two mixing centers in Texas. These are smaller cross-stocking style distribution facilities that handle many of our palletized products such as riding lawn movers and faster turning queue items such as feed, animal bedding and grass seeds. With our vendors delivering products directly to these mixing centers, we are shortening the supply chain replenishment time and distance to stores and lowering our in-store inventory levels while improving in-stock levels. Thus far we are pleased with the initial results. Construction of our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona is complete and finished on time and under budget. The facility began receiving inventory in early October and is on schedule to began shipping to stores in December. Over time, this distribution center will have the capacity to service upwards of 250 stores in the southwest region. And lastly, we opened 30 new stores in the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 114 new Tractor Supply stores in 2015. Our western expansion continues to be a key initiative and our stores that have opened in that region over the past few years continue to comp favorably against our chain average. In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our dedicated team members in our stores, the merchandising innovation center, our distribution facilities and our store support center. I realize that I comment on this a lot but it really is our people that set us apart and they drive the success, innovation and unique culture we have here at Tractor Supply. I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our third quarter financials. Tony Crudele : Great. Thanks, Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended September 26, 2015 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 8.5% to $1.48 billion, net income grew 14% to $87.3 million and EPS increased 16.4% to $0.64 per diluted share. Comp store sales increased 2.9% in the third quarter compared to increase of 5.6% in last year's third quarter. Similar to last year, good ground moisture and mild temperatures helped to extend the spring and summer selling season into the July and August timeframe. Key core categories performed very well such as the animal and pet categories and key seasonal categories such as fencing, trailer and outdoor recreation. As we moved through September, we did not experience the cold weather trends in the north that drove early fall and winter sales last year. Additionally, since we were coming off our second consecutive cold winter season, we believe customers did not have the same sense of urgency for pre-seasonal winter purchases as they did the year before. As a result, cold weather categories such as heating and power equipment did not perform to our expectations and negatively impacted comp sales. Sales were solid across all regions except for the northeast and upper Midwest as they did not benefit from the colder weather as I just mentioned. Our new stores in the western region continue to product above chain average comp sales as they gain market awareness and share. Comp transaction count increased for the 38th consecutive quarter gaining 3.8% on top of a 3.3% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by continued strength of our queue items and the strong performance of the spring-summer seasonal categories. Average comp ticket decreased by 90 basis points compared to last year's 220 basis point increase. Big ticket was the principal driver of the average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items were down low single digits year-over-year as soft sales of winter seasonal items such as heating stoves and log splitters were only partially offset by the strength in sales of trailers and utility vehicles. We estimate that deflation was approximately 25 basis points which also contributed to the decrease in the average ticket. The deflation was driven principally by livestock feed and lubricants. Now turning to gross margin, which increased approximately 60 basis points to 34.7% compared to last year's decrease of 30 basis points. While we had an easier comparison versus last year's third quarter gross margin decrease, our direct product margin was bolstered by strong price and markdown management. Price management tools continued to help us optimize our retail pricing while negotiating lower cost in some of the deflationary categories. Freight was favorable by six basis points which related to lower diesel prices. The favorable fuel price more than offset the stem mile increase from our western store expansion. The variance was not as favorable as Q2 as we had a merchandise mix shift to more freight intensive product in the third quarter. The mix of merchandise did not have a significant impact on gross margin as the favorable gross margin impact from softer big ticket sales was offset by strong sales in animal feed and pet food which are below chain average margin categories. We estimate the deflation only had a slight favorable impact on gross margin as deflation continues to moderate in the feed category. Import purchases in the quarter increased 16.6% and represented 11.2% of the sales mix. Also the exclusive brand sales increased to 8.2% compared to last year's Q3 and was approximately 31% of sales. For the quarter SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 25.3% of sales, an increase of 10 basis points over prior year's quarter. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q3 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll with the sales trend. We did incur startup expenses for our southwest distribution center and the two mixing centers. We estimate six to seven basis points of SG&A expense related to the startup cost. The expansion of Hagerstown DC in Q1 added incremental expenses to SG&A but we realized the cost benefit of lower stem miles in gross margin. We also experienced slightly higher rental leverage from the new stores as they ramped to maturity. This was driven primarily by the western store openings, which as we have discussed, generally opened with higher rent to sales ratio. With the opening of over 40 western stores in the past year, this continues to impact SG&A. Incentive compensation had minimal year-over-year impact on SG&A leverage. The year-over-year percent increase in SG&A was approximately 9% in the third quarter which was lower than our year-over-year increase in Q1 and Q2. As a reminder, the third quarter last year was impacted by expenses related to the move to our new store support center. So this along with onetime expense savings this year, made for a favorable comparison in Q3. Our run rate in Q4 is expected to be more consistent with the first half of the year. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 we had cash balance of $51.4 million and $190 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $47.5 million and $150 million in outstanding debt at the end of last year's third quarter. During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $119.4 million. Average inventory levels per store increased 1.6% compared to a 3.7% increase in last year's third quarter and annualized year-to-date to inventory turns decreased one basis points compared to last year as a result of the softer pre-season sales of cold weather items. We exited the spring-summer season with the normal seasonal markdown cadence. We continue to make investments in key inventory categories and we have brought several fall winter categories in early and are prepared for the season. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.5 million compared to $43..3 million last year. We opened 30 stores and closed two Del stores and one Tractor Supply store in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened in the third quarter of 2014. The CapEx increase relates to the construction expenditures of our southwest distribution center which were higher than the expenditures on our support center which was completed last year at this time. So looking ahead. Based upon third quarter results and as noted in today's press release, we have tightened the ranges of our financial expectations for the full year 2015. We expect full year sales to range from $6.28 billion to $6.33 billion. Full year comp sales are forecasted to increase between 4% and 4.5%. We are forecasting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement to our EBIT margin compared to 2014. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $413 million to $420 million or $3.02 to $3.08 per diluted share. Our capital expenditure forecast for full year 2015 remains $220 million to $230 million. We expect to finish the year with approximately 114 new stores. Additionally, we anticipate the full year tax rate will be approximately 37%. We will continue to make purchases under the share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 136.5 million to 137 million. Principally as a result of the share repurchases made year-to-date under our program, we expect that we will have an outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility of approximately $100 million to $150 million at year end. Our sales outlook is cautious based on the fact that weather and oil prices can impact sales this time of year. Last year we had a colder than average November and a warmer than average December. This year we expect that to flip and anticipate the impact will be neutral. Additionally, with the relatively low heating oil prices, there could be less consumer demand for wood burning stoves and some of heating and fuel categories. We have seen in the early part of the fourth quarter as the weather turns cold, that consumer response to our winter seasonal assortment. As in the past, our merchant team has been nimble and adjusting to weather shifts and we are confident that our team has put together a great plan to drive winter seasonal merchandise when the cold weather arrives. In the fourth quarter we expect deflation to continue to moderate and we will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share. We expect EBIT margin in the fourth quarter to be slightly down with a modest increase in gross margin to be offset by SG&A deleverage. Our gross margin initiatives continue to drive improvement in merchandising margin and lower diesel prices should benefit freight transportation. As I mentioned earlier regarding SG&A, the third quarter this year benefitted from the comparison to last year's lease write-offs and accelerated depreciation relative to our store support center move. We expect SG&A run rate in the fourth quarter to be more consistent with the first half of the year and estimate SG&A increase in the range of 10% in the fourth quarter. The key elements driving the incremental increase in our SG&A run rate results principally from the start of operations of our new southwest distribution center which we estimate to be 1.5 to 2 cent EPS drag, and rent deleveraging resulting from the increased mix of the new western stores. Although I will provide full guidance at our year-end conference call, I wanted to provide you with some considerations for your modeling of 2016. Fiscal year 2016 will be the year that we add a 53rd week to our retail fiscal year. Based on past trends, we estimate that this will provide and EPS benefit of approximately $0.02 to $0.03. This will be the first year of operations of the southwest distribution center. This will increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis while improving gross margin through reduced transportation expense. We expect a net EPS decrease of approximately $0.04. We will continue to transition the Del stores to Tractor Supply stores. We expect the majority of the Del stores to close in the fourth quarter and anticipate it will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.02. As we have stated in our long-term capital plan, we look to manage the annual capital expenditures in the $200 million to $250 million range in order to be ratable in our allocation of capital and leverage depreciation expense over the next several years. In 2016 we will not have a significant cash investment of a distribution center and we will look to continue investing in our stores and key initiatives to benefit long-term growth. Our goal continues to be to execute these initiatives while managing the financial impact to deliver our annual EPS target of mid-teens growth. To conclude, we are pleased with our results and execution in the third quarter, we believe that we took advantage of the extended spring-summer selling season and are well-positioned to deliver another solid growth year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : A couple of questions. First, just on the third quarter, the September with the cold weather products. Tony, you said it weighed on comps, can you qualify maybe to what degree that shift kind of weighed on the second quarter, or on the third quarter? And was September comps positive or was it such that it actually dragged those negative? Tony Crudele : Pete, as far as the comps go, we did have a positive comp in September and really we saw the drag just impact the last few weeks of the month. So as much as we don\u2019t really give monthly comp, I don\u2019t want to go into the specific details as to what the impact was but it did have an impact on the quarter relative to what our expectations were. Peter Benedict : Okay. No, that's fair enough. And just looking at the new store productivity, I know that the way we calculate it isn't always perfect but it had been running mid to high 70s. It was in the low 70s in the quarter. I don't know if that had something to do with some of the closings or the timing of the openings. Was there anything interesting within the productivity of new stores that you saw during the third quarter? Tony Crudele : No, there is nothing unusual and any differences really would relate to timing of the store openings. Peter Benedict : Okay. My last question is just around the D&A profile. You're going to open up the DC. You've been running like $30 million of D&A per quarter here through the first three quarters of '15. How does that step up in the fourth quarter, how materially? And then as we think to next year, just a thought on D&A growth year-over-year. You may have mentioned that in your outlook, if you did I apologize. Tony Crudele : No. We didn\u2019t specifically focus on D&A. But I would not expect that the run rate in the fourth quarter to step up significantly and it would be more impactful next year as the DC comes on line and we have a full year of depreciation relative to the DC. Operator : Next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust. David Magee : Good quarter. Was there much or have you seen much of an impact today on sales in the oil patch areas at this point? Steve Barbarick : Yes, David, this is Steve Barbarick. And first of all, I think on the last call we mentioned that the oil drilling areas represent about 10% of our total store count. And a large majority of those stores are down in Texas, so I will use the example here. We have got control stores down there and we have got the what we consider to be the oil and gas stores. The oil and gas stores are running positive comps and they have positive traffic. However, with that said, they are running less than company in chain average. Where we are seeing the impact is on some of the categories that are more bigger ticket. So truck boxes and in fuel tanks and some compressors. We are making that up, however, in a lot of the basic needs that our customers have down there in terms of consumable businesses. So generally speaking, we are seeing little bit of an impact but generally it's not been material enough to impact the overall company's comps. David Magee : Would you say it's been sort of running stable at that level or has there been any change in the past couple of months? Steve Barbarick : I mean it's been pretty stable. It's trended down a little bit. It's not significant. It's nothing that would be worth noting. David Magee : Okay. Thank you. And then my second question has to do with just further opportunity with regard to higher ASP items to bring into the mix. As you look to next year do you see more additions, more upside in that area? Steve Barbarick : Actually, this is an area that we see an opportunity with. And we have talked a lot on the merchant team about the fact that our customers are looking for value. But value can be on the higher end of the ticket as well. And we have seen some nice movement in recreational vehicles, we have brought in some higher end trailers. We are also looking at a number of commercial products as we move forward. For example, some heavier duty cattle handling cattle handling equipment up in the northwest. Looking at, I guess at higher end trailers, premium rubber footwear, price points that may range up to the $200 price point. We are also expanding some recreational vehicles and we have got a unit right now that we are testing that\u2019s up to $9000. So generally speaking, we are seeing an opportunity with our customers to actually take them upscale by offering new products is differentiated. Operator : Next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : I thank you, and great results. I want to dig in a little bit, Tony, on the gross margin dynamic. The up 60 basis points year-on-year is a little bit better than Q2 at the same time looks like you got less benefit from freight. So are you seeing some accelerating benefits around your product margin from the clearance optimization effort? Tony Crudele : Yes, Peter, as we try to sort of break out the components, it is obviously difficult because many things overlap. But we firmly believe that probably the most significant driver outside of the fuel, the favorability of the fuel, really was in the price management and really sort of the vendor negotiation and working with the vendors and coming up with some great programs. So that along with the price management tools and getting better at optimizing the prices, I think really was the key component in that large increase in the gross margin percent. Peter Keith : Is there anything within Q3 with regard to seasonality and maybe the summer to fall transition that gives you more opportunity in Q3 with regard to price management relative to other quarters or can it be pretty consistent through the year? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Peter, this is Steve. I would tell you, it can be consistent. I mean there were times of the year where spring seasonal were transitional and fall winter were transitioning. There are always pivotal months. This past quarter we talked a little bit about clearance optimization and while it only makes up a small part of the total pricing management tools that we have, we were able to leverage that tool. We had about 60% of our clearance merchandize on that tool and early learnings suggested that we take markdowns earlier and we take them a little deeper while we have got them in the home before we have to liquidate them in the back of the store. So the team did an excellent job executing to that and we think that tool is going to give us momentum as we refine it and we get better with it. Operator : Next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : One more on macro. I hate to waste one of my questions on it but the age old question of farm income. I know we talk about it probably once every four or six quarters but you probably have better granularity on it by regions. So curious, any impact that you are seeing from it? As you get bigger maybe you have more impact with a wider reach of customers. Curious if there is any correlation to that or still irrelevant to your business. Greg Sandfort : Yes. Simeon, I hate that you waste your question on that one as well. Yes, we do not see any correlation with the farm income and as we look at the performance across the country and in the particular areas where the farming is stronger, again, we can't draw a correlation. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. And then another question on I guess stem miles or gross margin. It's a little early I think to talk about next year, you gave us a couple of clues. You mentioned the headwind this year, stem miles. Does the headwind stay the same next year or does it moderate with the new DC opening? Greg Sandfort : Yes, good question. When we look at it and model it out, our goal is to obviously support the operations at DC by reducing transportation cost. And as we move into next year and as I mentioned that we do anticipate having a drag next year, a net drag between the transportation improvements and the operations of DC. One of the keys is to reduce the stem miles and that is very dependent on our vendor base and making sure that they have key shipping points out west. And so we do anticipate and we modeled accordingly to show some reduction in the stem miles but we still have some more work to do as we continue to improve the shipping points from the vendor base. Simeon Gutman : I guess just to clarify that point, I know we didn\u2019t put a number on what stem miles are holding back gross margin, but is that basis point amount, could that end up -- is it less of a drag by virtue of comparison or could it be the same number next year as this year? Greg Sandfort : No, I think definitely the stem miles will decrease substantially, so we will have a positive impact relative to the gross margin. Just not to the extent that it will offset the full four wall operations of the distribution center. Operator : Next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Just digging into the ticket component of comps this quarter. When you look at big ticket, it slowed, it seems primarily related to weather and maybe the comparison. Anything else to read into that or should we expect that to pick back up as the weather turns? Steve Barbarick : Seth, this is Steve. It was little bit of a mixed bag because we saw some improvements in things like recreational vehicles and trailers. But the drag was in categories such as, and Tony had mentioned, stoves and log splitters and generators. Those typically tend to be a little bit more weather driven and being a needs based retailer you kind of see that. So I would tend to skew toward that and not a shift in customer spending behavior. Seth Sigman : Okay. And then a separate question on the loyalty program that you guys are testing. I realize it's early but maybe to that last point, given the need based aspect of the business, can you discuss where you see some of the incremental opportunities from that program and maybe the cost associated with rolling that out? Steve Barbarick : Well, it is early, let me just say that first. And to give you a sense for how early it is, we just starting piling it, I guess, 21 days ago. It's in about 10% of our stores and it's in different regions so we can track it. Right now this is, I think Greg said, we are pleased with the initial response from our customers. What the data is giving us is the ability to track their purchases going forward as well as an email address so we can be more efficient in the way we communicate with them and personalize that communication. We are still working through the next steps in how we are going to manage this. I can tell you that today working with our marketing department, not everything we do is highly efficient. And we are going to be able to tailor some of those dollars and move them into our loyalty program. And at the end of the day, I think what we are going to do is we should see an improvement of loyalty with these customers which should follow sales and it should offset the cost that we would put into the program. Operator : Next question comes from Hiram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Hiram Rubinson : I have two things. One is, you have done a great job over time of broadening out the assortment even as you said getting into RVs up to $9000. Could you just talk a little bit about how your assortment looks versus a typical general store in the markets that you operate? What might be missing from your mix that others might have? Trying to figure out what new categories maybe could be relevant. Steve Barbarick : You know Hiram I would tell you that we have got a differentiated assortment and it's what has made our organization very successful. We always talk about that in retail plagiarism is free and highly efficient, so we are shopping our farm store competitors, we are shopping big boxes and automotive centers. And we look it for those categories that we think are relevant to our customers lifestyles. Those folks that live out here as we call it. So again, there is a variety of things that we are testing and trying and I don\u2019t think there is any one or two specific things that I could mention on the call right now that we are probably not attempting somehow in our stores now or in the future. Hiram Rubinson : But if you look -- let's say we take a look back at your assortment three years from now or five years from now, do you think we are seeing the tip of the iceberg in your store or are we still seeing the vast majority of the iceberg? Steve Barbarick : Hiram, I have been with the organization for 18 years and I am as bullish today as I was 17 or 18 years ago when I got here working in merchandizing. Hiram Rubinson : Well said. Let me just follow up on the second question around how you want to use your Internet business. Can you tell us whether or not you are looking to use it primarily for informational purposes for new products or for existing products? And if it is for existing products, do you have categories that are in the store today that you think that you can almost migrate online? Greg Sandfort : Hiram, it's Greg. The strategy behind our omnichannel business is very simple. It's called the three Cs and it first starts with content. And content means giving the customer the information they need to make a decision to either buy online, buy in our store, research products that they think they have either an interest in or a need to have to satisfy something that they are either doing, building a project or something that they need to replace on their property. The second piece of it is community. And what we are finding is, through our experience right now out there in some of the social sites and our activity there, our consumers like to converse with us and with one another. So all that\u2019s doing is bringing them closer to us as a consumer base making us more of the desired, I think, retailer for them to exchange hopefully commerce with. And that is then the third C, commerce. And we are not -- we didn\u2019t set our site up nor did we ever think that it was going to be a large percentage of our sales. Our stores are located out where the customer lives. We are more convenient, if they break something let's say on a particular piece of tillage equipment or they blow a gasket on a small engine, they are not going to dial into the Web site and expect to get that delivery and wait for two or three days. They are going to expect to go to the store, find the part, replacement part, repair what they are doing and get back to the task. So the commerce side for us as we build out this entire omnichannel piece is to have immediate product available to them because we live close to them. So the strategy is, the first two Cs to be the first C. And we are never going to say that it's going to be a large percentage of our business but we are convinced and through the Neighbors program we are going to be able to track much closer those customers who are engaging with us through the web and then tying that back to a four wall store sales number. Hiram Rubinson : Well, that world is evolving and it sounds like you have been pretty consistent in your approach so I appreciate the update. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Tony, you outlined a number of put and takes that are going to impact the business next year. It wasn\u2019t clear in totality, should we expect mid-teens earnings growth next year? Tony Crudele : Yes. Absolutely our target is to always grow the company EPS in the mid-teens. So that is our goal and we will manage accordingly. Michael Lasser : And is that going to be inclusive of the extra week or will the extra week be on top of that? Tony Crudele : You know since there is generally a range, and I know most people are going to probably be doing 15% and 17%, but I like to say mid-teens. So this is somewhere between 13% and 17%. So generally with or without that additional week since it is only a few cents, we anticipate that we will fall within that range. [indiscernible] growth. Michael Lasser : Okay. My second question is, how are you thinking about the inflation, deflation environment as we move into the next year. Tony Crudele : Good question. When we look to next year, I anticipate right now at this point in time, slight deflation in the, say, first half of the year and then as we move to the back half we expect it to be flat or actually some small level of inflation. Michael Lasser : Are their things that could drive either upside or downside to that and maybe you think that would change the algorithm where deflation [leads] [ph] a little bit better on the margin side so gross profit dollar comp remains sustained? Tony Crudele : No. As we look at it, in the past it's always been the impact on feed and on petroleum products. And those are really the two large drivers. The steel element has been less impactful. And we believe that we have cycled through the majority of some of the declines in feed. So I think that would be the biggest driver so we expect it to definitely moderate next year and stabilize some. And as we have shown in the past, be it moderate inflation or moderate deflation we have been able to manage the business so that we can get to the right bottom line. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So a couple of quick questions here. My first one I think is a follow up to a prior question but just to dial deeper into Texas. I know you have talked about this in prior quarters too but the numbers you read out here, they just make it sound that the Texas market is performing okay. Maybe a little worse than the company average [indiscernible], but if you look at the stores there, is there any more troubling signs below those big aggregate numbers meaning that are you seeing a wider dispersion of performance in the stores or are sales trends generally more erratic than the chain? Steve Barbarick : No, Brian. As a matter of fact the only thing I would say is that the Texas market in total was right about company average. The oil drilling stores were the ones that were below company average. So Texas as a whole is still healthy. Brian Nagel : Okay. And then, I mean not to belay this but the oil drilling store you mentioned, is there something you have seen there, are you seeing more erratic trends and you would expect to make a loss in kind of the aggregate common? Steve Barbarick : No. I mean, it's not that volatile. I will tell you that when we saw a nice ramp up in compressors and some welders and big ticket merchandize, some of that has come down. But if you look at the total nucleus of the store, okay, in those area those stores are still comping positive and foot traffic is still positive even with the compression on some of the big ticket that we saw there. So I don\u2019t see anything that leads me to believe that Texas, the market itself or the state should be a concern for us. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s helpful. Then the second question, more of a maintenance question, but with regard to the Del stores, how many stores there are left to be closed and when should we expect to see those closed? Steve Barbarick : Generally, what we are trying to do, Brian, is time the closings relative to the lease expirations and do it as close as possible. But at the same time, we want to be able to open new stores and make sure that we transition staff appropriately. So as we see it, we believe the majority of the stores will close in the fourth quarter next year and we anticipate that being somewhere in the 16 to 17 store range in the fourth quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Christopher Horvers : Couple of follow up questions. So on the supply chain investment you spent about $16 million in CapEx in supply chain year-to-date. Curious, all-in, how much the DC will cost you on the CapEx side and or the mixing center is a big capital investment as well? Tony Crudele : Sure. The number that you are seeing includes obviously investment through all of the distribution centers. As we complete the southwest distribution center, we anticipate that that\u2019s going to be in the $70 million range. And then the mixing centers, they will vary depending whether it's lease or acquisition but we anticipate putting somewhere in the $6 million range for each one of the mixing centers. So it's not a significant large capital investment. Christopher Horvers : So as you think about the 200 to 250, the long-term capital guide, what could be some other, I guess chunky items that could fill in for that $70 million range. In other words, why wouldn\u2019t CapEx be a little bit lower next year than this year given you have will have that DC? Tony Crudele : Well, a part of the issue is that we started the distribution project last year so some of the CapEx is split between the two years. So when you are looking at a delta -- but what we look at as far as continued investments in the business is, one, we always want to continue to invest in our store infrastructure and make sure that there are kept as current and up-to-date as possible. But we have other programs. One program in particular next year that we think has a significant return on investment is our LED lighting change out. And not only does it meet our stewardship program but we are really excited about the cost savings as well. So that will be a capital investment but we believe that payback will help throughout next year as well as in future years. So those are the type of initiatives that we are going to be continuing to drive so that we can continue to capture savings and be able to utilize those savings to continue to grow the company in a very efficient and productive way. Christopher Horvers : And then on the west coast DC. How many stores are serviced out of that DC roughly at the end of this year and is there a -- what's the sort of store level that you start to get better leverage on, like you mentioned, the four wall ramped and operating cost of the distribution center. Tony Crudele : Sur. You know we anticipate by the end of the year we are going to be around 100 stores that will be services by that distribution center. And generally we map this center out to be able to handle about 250 to 300 stores. So it will have some significant additional capacity. As we move forward, again as I mentioned earlier, a lot of it has to do with vendor shipping points and we will continue to coordinate with our vendors and as our vendor base grows, hopefully they will grow with us as well and have shipping points out west. As well as it will help it will help our capacity when we have imports coming in from the west and that will reduce some of the stem miles. So one of the keys is that as we progress more towards about the 150 store range, we will start to see some benefits and hopefully we will have more of a net impact, net neutral impact when it comes to the P&L. Christopher Horvers : So it seems like based on the timing of the weighting of the West Coast opens, that starts to be something really later, later in 2016 where you could see some leverage or at least flattening out. Tony Crudele : Yes. Now clearly as we move through the year, we will start to gather more of the benefits through the distribution center. And so, yes, as you model, when you look at the drag that we identified in the, I guess about the $0.04 range, I would say in the first year it's going to be slightly weighted more to the first half but it's not going to be something that's so front weighted that there won't be any impact in Q4. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We next move to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : You called out a bunch of different pressures in the SG&A line and considering all that, I actually thought that it looked very well controlled. I was wondering what might have went in your favor this quarter. Can you comment on that? Tony Crudele : Sure. When we look at the -- the biggest number what I had identified which was related to the store support center that happened last year. And I think as we accumulated the adjustments relative to lease write-offs and accelerated depreciation, it totaled in about to $3 million range. So that clearly was the largest one. As we look to the back half of the year coming into it, we had some expense savings initiatives out there and we felt that we did a great job in particular in the third quarter itself. But some of those are really just one time savings that relate just to the third quarter. Again, we are focused on the fourth quarter but as we have forecasted out, we believe that we won't have that benefit of the store support center expenses last year in Q3. So we expect to inch back up into the 10% range versus the 9% that we are at in Q3. Stephen Tanal : Got it. And can you just remind us what some of those savings initiatives were? Tony Crudele : Relative to -- they really just relate more to some of the discretionary expenses that we have in the quarter. And even it could be just basic ones relative to how we had managed the store payroll, as we mentioned, in Q2. We went in a little bit heavier with some of our payroll initiatives but as we came into Q3, the team did a tremendous job in managing that. Now as we move into Q4, it's a big selling period for us and we expect to continue to driver our sales with proper adequate staffing to do that. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay. And just lastly, can you just remind us what kind of a comp you need to leverage rent and occupancy within SG&A? Tony Crudele : It will vary quarter-over-quarter and one of the biggest impacts is the incentive compensation. So I will always qualify with that. But when it comes to leveraging, we have really been more in the 3.5% to 4% range when it comes to leveraging SG&A. And again my other standard qualification is that a lot of the things that we do as far as improving the business and the initiatives that we have, that expanse runs through our SG&A where some of it will benefit our gross margin initiative. So things like demand planning, obviously the mixing centers expenses in SG&A, the distribution centers in SG&A, but we will get the benefit on the gross margin line. So that\u2019s why I believe that it makes it a little bit more difficult to be able to leverage SG&A and that\u2019s why you see the number running into 3.5% to 4% comp range. Operator : Next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My first question is on new store productivity, just want to follow up there. You noted, Tony, that there is nothing with timing this quarter. Is the decline that we saw in new store productivity year-over-year related to the productivity out of some of the western stores? Tony Crudele : Well, when I look at it I really think it would just the timing of the store openings. Our stores that are opening this year are exceeding our pro forma very consistent with past performance. So it's really a non-issue. Some of it from a sales productivity standpoint really can be the mix of the stores that we are opening and that would be the only other impact other than the timing. Seth Basham : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just in terms of the merchandising trends. You talked about pet food and animal feed being a pretty strong category. Can you comment on how you fared with the Purina feed line expansion? Steve Barbarick : Yes, absolutely. Seth, this is Steve. That launch was really part and parcel of something much bigger and that\u2019s our key strategy. And we added the product in our stores, it was really around more premium for horse, cattle and show feeds. It allowed us to hit higher price points. There was a question earlier about higher price points and how our customers are reacting. You know it's still a relatively small portion of our total business, the expanded line that we put in, but I can tell you it's been incremental and we have seen nice growth in our feed business. And I believe the addition of these SKUs has lend credibility to the entire line. So we are pleased with it. Operator : Next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Chai : Just going back to the weather issue towards the end of the quarter. Could you talk about the delta between, say the Northeast and upper Midwest and the other regions? Tony Crudele : Relative to the weather itself or the performance? Denise Chai : Comps in those regions once you started to anniversary the strong demand for fall and winter products that happened last year. Tony Crudele : Sure. Clearly, up north during that period of time where you are expecting a little bit cooler weather, the comps in the upper Midwest and the northeast ran slightly down. And when I say slightly I mean very low single digits during that time period. But other than that the rest of the chain performed very well. So it clearly wasn\u2019t a weather issue when it came to the softness of sales. Denise Chai : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And are you able to break out how much big ticket was a drag on overall ticket? Tony Crudele : Well, we had quantified that at being about 90 basis points that it impacted average tickets. When it came to the transactions, for us big ticket is relatively small transaction impact and the impact generally is going to be on the average ticket itself. So I would just use the 90 basis points that we talked about on average ticket. Denise Chai : Okay. Got it. And just last one. Since you've relaunched your Web site, could you give us an update in terms of what sort of growth you're seeing online, average order size? How much gets picked up in store and what categories you're really seeing the most traction? Greg Sandfort : Denise, this is Greg. I won't give you which categories are doing best or worst, I think it follows suit to what you heard for the rest of the company sales. We suffered a little bit in heating and other places like that. What we are finding is because this side is more easier to navigate with, the customers are starting to add multiple things to baskets. Our actual traffic is up, our conversion is about flat to where it was but that\u2019s anytime you go through a change like that in the Web site or some things you have to do within Google's search engine to gain that some of that back. But we are very optimistic that the changes we have made as we go through the holiday season are going to benefit us in a big way. Operator : Next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated. Ben Bienvenu : So you talked a little bit about the mixing centers in Texas. You've also talked about 20 to 30 centers that you think you could build longer term. Do you have any sense of the velocity of that build out or is it just too early at this point? Greg Sandfort : Yes, I would tell you that, Ben, that it's a model we need to make sure that it's going to prove itself out. We, as you know, had about a two year, 18 month to two year test of this in the back of one of our other distribution centers where we had space. We have now rolled two physical facilities into play. So far I would say we are pleased but some of the challenges, they are going to be different in different markets. So right now we placed these two in Texas and these are high velocity feed food markets. As we will use these in other parts of the country and the key behind this is to bring inventory more direct to the store, faster replenishment, pull that inventory out of the back of the store so they don\u2019t have to hold two and three weeks worth of supply. That makes it so much easier for a store to operate. But so far so good but it's going to be little different by region and all I can tell you is we may not 30 or 25, we may find it 15 to 18 is enough. But it really is -- supply chain build out is something we are still working through and we will give you more information on that as time progresses. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. And then maybe switching gears back to the southwest distribution center. As that center comes online, obviously you've talked about the reduction in stem miles, but to what extent do you expect it to positively benefit store productivity from a sales perspective? And can you point to instances in the past where you've built new DCs and how that may have impacted sales at surrounding stores that were serviced? Greg Sandfort : Well, the last several DCs we have built, one was a replacement DC from a Georgia DC to another, the other was one located in the Midwest here early, I will call it beginning of the south which is up in Franklin, Kentucky. And that was just based upon volume of stores that were opening in the region. So here would be some of the benefits in this Arizona facility. Stores in the West Coast no longer have to have merchandize moving from Waverley, Nebraska and Waco, Texas. The transit time is long. So we should be able to turn that transit time and make it much shorter to replenish those stores if we see a run on the certain category of business. Secondly, we will hold a little different mix of product in that distribution center than you would have say in the eastern part of the United States because the climate and temperatures are different out there. So some of the unique mix of products that we would not typically store in the other DCs we will put into this distribution center in hopes of having more of the manufacturers that build that specific product sitting in the West Coast for either manufacturing or their own distribution facility so we can move it to our DC and then back to our stores, not moving it from the east all the way across to our DC and then from there to the stores. So it's really about replenishment capability and turnaround time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We next move to Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Jaime Katz : I just wanted to follow on that mixing center question. I'm curious how that plays into how you guys think about inventory turns longer and then how that flows through to possible improvement in the gross margin. Do you guys have maybe a goal of where you'd like those trends to go, because you've made some pretty impressive strides over the last handful of years there? Greg Sandfort : Jamie, good question. Here is a couple of things to think about. One is, mixing centers are closer distance to the store base than the large DC. So the whole philosophy behind that was to be able to turn merchandise faster back to the stores, replenish and keep the weeks of inventory out of the backrooms because our stores don\u2019t have large backrooms. We like to bring inventory in so much just in time and push it to the floor. So the modeling we have done on all this would tell you that number one, it makes the store to easy to operate and number two, we should see some gain in turn. But the facts are that we have only got two up and running. It's not significant enough to probably impact the overall company turn at this point but longer term it should. Jaime Katz : Okay. And then do you guys have any comments on the HomeTown Pet, read through on how those consumers are maybe converting to regular Tractor Supply consumers or adopting some of the brands a little bit more broadly? I don't know if there's any anecdotal evidence that that's happening yet. Lee Downing : Well, this is Lee. We are just about a cycle a year, so we continue to still learn because we are just now going to see some comparisons come up so we are excited about that. As far as brand conversion, what we are seeing is the customers are somewhat different, they are a little bit smaller dogs and smaller animals than they are in Tractor Supply that maybe outside dogs. So I think we see a little bit difference there. We are seeing the customers are eager to adopt our exclusive brands, so I think that\u2019s a great learning that we can deliver good value on both sets of the equation there. And I think overall, it's been a -- we feel very confident that we are getting some learnings for Tractor Supply as we move forward. So I think we are very positive about it. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Greg, at the investor meeting back in February, you had discussed the opportunity to open stores in markets that are a bit larger than you have historically. You gave some examples in the Houston area, stores that were a bit closer to, say, a Home Depot and Lowe's. Can you discuss how the stores with that change in the real estate strategy are performing? Greg Sandfort : Dan, not really a change in real estate strategy, more of a learning from our real estate portfolio. And what we have seen that it continues to work for us. Today our base store is a little different than it was maybe ten years ago when we are purely, for the most part, a rural lifestyle store sitting a good 15-20 miles outside of most city limits. Today with some of the urban crawl and some of the other locations that our real estate model has told us can work for us, we do sit a little closer to some of the Home Depot's and Lowe's. We are not as far out as we once were. About 67% to 68%, I think the number of our stores, sit within a proximity of a Home Depot and a Lowe's. So we complement one another in those markets, to be very honest. I think you may have had one of the store walks with the team and you notice that we both have hardware but it's very different assortments. We both have tools, but we are heavily into welding and in to power equipment that\u2019s used in air tools whereas they are into more hand tools and electric type products. So the store base will continue to evolve, Dan, as the model tells us where we can place those stores. But it hasn\u2019t changed really that much it's just evolving. Dan Wewer : Okay. And then just one quick follow up. We estimate that the inventory per square foot finished the quarter up about 1.2%. Had the company not seen the softness in some of the winter product during the last couple of weeks in September, were you expecting your inventory per store to be essentially flat year-over-year? Greg Sandfort : Probably a little down, to be very honest because we came out of the spring season. Steve and his team did a great job managing through the inventories and we are actually chasing some product towards the latter part of second, early third quarter. But what caused a little bit of movement upward was really all the forward movement of some heating products and things into the assortment and into the stores a little earlier. Yes. That was the impact of it. Operator : Next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : What I'd like to ask about is a little bit more related to precipitation, which often is affected by the temperature. But where it's been particularly dry, what are you seeing in terms of water handling equipment, things related to pumps and tankage, and how was that performing? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Chuck, I mean we have talked a lot about being a needs based retailer and when it comes either wet weather or dry weather, we see our business thrive in many of those cases we are a destination for those types of products. So if it's dry, people need to transfer water. We sell water pumps. We have got a full line of different products to support their needs. So we won't get into the specifics of it but I can tell you as a needs based retailer and the differentiated assortments that we have, we typically do pretty well and I would use the example of the West Coast for example. We have seen dry weather out there for quite a while but yet we continue to open stores and see, as Tony said, above average comps in a lot of those stores. So, again, it works for our model. Operator : Next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Two things. First of all, the sales that were impacted by weather at the end of the quarter, do those get recaptured at full margin is the expectation in 4Q, and is this material in the whole scheme of things? Steve Barbarick : Eric, this is Steve. What I can tell you is, as when it got cold a few weeks and few days, we saw our cold weather business move. What I can't tell you is how cold it's going to be in Q4 and what part of the country it's going to be really cold in. What I can say, and Tony said it earlier I think on his initial call, is that last year in November it was colder, December was a little warmer. We think that\u2019s going to flip. But I can't say whether or not all sales are going to be deferred. Q4, we do much more cold weather products than we do in Q3. Q3 was a small portion of the total. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly on gross margin, the upside in the quarter, the payback from some of the price and markdown optimization. Not asking if there's more quarters above 60 basis points of gross margin but are there more quarters of notable benefit from those efforts? How should we think about that? Steve Barbarick : Yes. What I would tell you is that we have invested in a variety of systems and we do expect get some benefit from those systems but there is a number of variables that play in the margin as well. We will continue to become more efficient as we use science rather than art and that\u2019s how we are operating today. So I think we have got a good track record and a good run but I don\u2019t know what percent you are going to see those improvements over time. We are going to continue to operate as we have in the past. Tony, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add. Tony Crudele : No, I would agree that the most important thing is a lot of it is year-over-year performance and markdowns and clearance through a particular cycle or season. That\u2019s going to override the benefit of any of the price management tools that we put into place. But the key is, as we continue to develop these tools and utilize and become more adapt, we clearly lay a basis of improvements so that we can continue to even in a tough quarter be able to drive more efficient and better sales and obviously drive the comps. So it's really a critical element of our continuous improvement program. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : First, I guess I'd like to say I'm glad I was wrong on the quarter. Very solid, as always. Greg Sandfort : Everybody gets the tractor Adam. Adam Sindler : Yes, I know. That's what you guys told me last time. I have learned my lesson. So I want to focus my question on the continued strong traffic trends. As you look at the results, I'm hoping maybe you could provide a little bit more color on the drivers here. I know you guys have been doing a lot with customer acquisition initiatives, maybe more share of wallet from existing customers, and then as you look at the new western stores, maybe how much is coming from there? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Adam, what I would tell you is is that a lot of it has to do with our strategy around queue. We continue to gain momentum in a lot of those businesses and a needs-based retailer, when you sell a lot of consumables and you build loyalty, and we have got great team members in our stores, you get a lot of repeat customers coming back through. You know there is also the word of mouth marketing that we get the benefit of because we are in local communities. And a lot of the folks that shop us tell their neighbors. And so I think it's 30 straight quarters of comp transaction growth and I think a lot of that stems from a lot of what we are doing inside the store but I would also tell you has a lot to do with the assortments that we put strategies around. Adam Sindler : And as you think about maybe who you're taking share from, I know in the past you've discussed a number, or a number of how many of these smaller, really mom and pop operations you have. But then just sort of relative to Dan's question earlier, you find that you are maybe a little bit easier to evolve your real estate strategy into larger cities, maybe some more from some of the big box guys. As you look at that really small mom and pop though, is that number still coming down quite a bit and how much do you think share do they really have of the market? Steve Barbarick : We don\u2019t typically get into the share number game here. What we can say is we are a consolidator for the lifestyle and our goal as an organization is to bring the needs of our customer under one roof and allow them to come in and our hope is that they will shop, peg hooks, shelves, four ways, center courts and end caps. And I think we have done a nice job with our assortments, tailoring them to that lifestyle and they continue to reward us with traffic. Greg Sandfort : I would also say, Adam, the emphasis Steve and the merchant team and the marketing team and the stores team have put in to this localization of products and really being understanding the market needs has played off and paid big dividends for us. Our stores may look the same as you walk through them but as you go down those aisles, as Steve was saying those end caps and that, you are going to notice very specific products geared toward those individual markets. And in this business and those who we compete with in this business, they are good at that. And that\u2019s something that we have gotten far better at for the last several years. Operator : And with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Greg Sandfort for closing remarks. Greg Sandfort : Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today and we are looking ahead and we are pleased with our performance as I said for the first nine months of the year and we really do feel very positive about our position heading into fourth quarter. Along with our continuous improvement efforts as Steve had mentioned, we have got things happening in merch and in marketing and we will continue to invest in our systems and infrastructure to support the long-term growth of Tractor Supply, driving return on capital and achieving our goal of mid-teens annual earnings growth. Thank you for your continued support of Tractor Supply and we look forward to speaking with you again in January regarding our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 results. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. As we previously reported, the fourth quarter fell below our expectations, due principally to the record warm temperatures across most of the country. Our team managed the business to the best of their capabilities throughout the quarter. And over the past several weeks, we have experienced improvement in our sales trends for cold weather products, as the weather and temperatures have normalized. As the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for the rural lifestyle, our customers shop our stores regularly for their basic needs. Those basic needs include : food and food for their pets, livestock and other animals; repair parts for their fence lines and animal containment; and maintenance products to ensure their equipment is properly serviced. This past quarter, with the unseasonably warm temperatures across many regions of the country, the need for cold weather products, such as insulated outerwear, snow blowers and heating products just did not materialize as we had planned. Despite the warmer temperatures negatively affecting the sales of cold weather products, our sales of everyday basic products in non-seasonal categories continued to perform well in the quarter, increasing in the low- to mid-single digits on a comparable store basis. Sales in the Western region, where weather was more normalized, did experience high-single-digit comparable store sales, and we delivered our 31st consecutive quarter of transaction count growth as a company. We believe this performance reinforces the resiliency of our model and our ability to meet the needs of our customers. We also feel that we are well-positioned with the current mix and depth of products to address our customers' ongoing seasonal and basic needs as we soon begin the transition for the spring selling season. Now let me touch on a few operating highlights and key initiatives in the quarter and for the upcoming year. Our new customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club, was rolled out to 140 stores in October. And the fourth quarter was our first full quarter with the program in place. While it is early and the program is still being tested, we are pleased with the enrollment, which is running ahead of our initial projections, and our customer attribution rates continue to improve. Our customers appreciate the ability to stay connected with us, and we are excited about the opportunity to use the data we are collecting to speak to them in more direct and relevant ways. We will continue to monitor the results from the initial test and determine next steps with the program later this year. In omnichannel, we made several enhancements to the platform in the fourth quarter. We increased the number of products and vendors available for dropship. We expanded our delivery capabilities for larger heavier items, and we implemented new tools at the store level to improve the customer experience. And since introducing the fully-responsive website, we have noted a steady increase in the amount of mobile traffic as well. Customers are choosing mobile to find their nearest store, check availability of product and view informational videos. We now have over 150 dropship vendors fully implemented, and more customers are choosing the buy online and ship-to-store option. Later this year, we will be testing the buy online and pick up at store option. We are currently testing mobile devices as well in a select number of stores to assist our team members with faster availability of product information and improved checkout speed for our customers. Thus far, the feedback from both our team members and the customer has been positive. At less than 1% of our sales, omnichannel is still a very small part of the business, but it is growing rapidly, and we are delighted with the progress we have made with our offerings of content, community and commerce. With respect to merchandising and store operations, we will continue to test new products, raise the level of execution and improve our customer service in our stores. We continue to score best-in-class on our customer satisfaction surveys and look to further enhance their shopping experience. Our focus in 2016 will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store, as well as opportunities to increase our exclusive brand penetration, always being mindful of the needed positioning for key national brands that our customers expect to find within our assortments. We are improving our in-store special order process in 2016 to enable our team members to better assist customers in locating the hard-to-find products through expanding our product offerings with our dropship vendors. And also in 2016, we expect to begin implementation of a new product information management software tool. This will help us standardize product information across all selling channels and will improve the quality of images, product descriptions and the speed with which we can add additional dropship vendors to our omnichannel commerce capability. We are currently performing a comprehensive reset of our pet food area to better align our product selection with more relevant brand assortments at a localized level. Our recent announcement regarding our partnership with Save Our Shelter on the CW's television channel reinforces our commitment to pets. And through the support of animal shelters, we hope to provide a healthy and happy environment for pets that are awaiting adoption. In our supply chain we began shipping to stores from the new Casa Grande, Arizona, distribution center in the fourth quarter. This new DC will service the growing base of Western stores and will, over time, reduce outbound stem miles while improving our delivery capabilities. The facility has the capacity to service upwards of 250 stores and should be shipping to approximately 120 stores by the middle of this year. As part of our continuous improvement culture, we are also performing a comprehensive network analysis in 2016 to ensure that we have the plans in place to support our future growth. This is something we have completed every three years to four years as a company as we've grown our store base. We will continue to reduce our impact on the environment through our Stewardship Program. And we are proud to have achieved our second LEED Silver Certification with the opening of our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. And in 2016 and 2017, we will be embarking on our largest environmental sustainability project to-date, as we retrofit the entire store base with new LED lighting, which will substantially lower our future store lighting energy costs. In closing, let me extend my thanks to all of the hardworking team members of our Tractor Supply family, who go the country mile every day for our customers. It is our people who are the driving force behind the success of our company. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our fourth quarter results and an initial look for 2016. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 26, 2015, on a year-over-year basis net sales increased 3.9% to $1.65 billion. Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million, and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 1.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to an increase of 5.3% in the last year's fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 31st consecutive quarter, gaining 0.6% on top of a 3% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by the continued strength of our C.U.E. and everyday items. Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 230 basis point increase. As a follow-up to the information previously provided in our business update press release, comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the warm winter weather. Outside of seasonal, the core basic business performed very well. Specifically, the livestock and pet category experienced a mid-single-digit same-store sales increase. Sales softness was primarily isolated to the cold weather seasonal categories of heating, specifically stoves and fuel, and installed (sic) [insulated] (11:34) outerwear, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The decline in these categories alone impacted comp sales by nearly 400 basis points. Since the business update press release, sales in cold weather categories have continued to improve. Sales were also impacted by softness in seasonal big ticket items, such as snow blowers, log splitters and generators. Big ticket sales declined approximately 6%. However, we did see strong sales in trailers and other non-seasonal related outdoor power equipment. We estimate that big ticket had a negative impact on average ticket of 70 basis points. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest were the most impacted by the unseasonably warm weather. Excluding these regions, the remaining regions of the country aggregated a low-single-digit same-store sales increase. The company had high-single-digit comp sales and growth in the Western region, where the seasonal trends were more normalized and the store base is less mature. In addition to the points highlighted in the business update, with respect to sales cadence through the quarter, November was the only month in which we experienced a comp sales decline, as we were cycling a double-digit comp sales increase last year. Although still a small percent of sales, e-commerce sales increased 30% in Q4. Deflation continued to moderate, and we estimate it impacted sales negatively by approximately 15 basis points in the quarter Overall, Texas stores performed at chain average. However, the delta in the performance of the Texas oil patch stores widened relative to the chain average. When comparing only to the Southern stores to adjust for the winter sales impact, Texas store sales performed approximately 350 basis points below that store group. Comp transactions for Texas were positive and performed consistent with the Southern stores. The variance in performance is primarily associated with products specific to the oil industry business that carry a higher average ticket and to a lesser extent the related decline in traffic normally generated by these categories. Now turning to gross margin, which was essentially flat at 34.1% on top of last year's increase of 16 basis points. The merchandise team did a great job in managing gross margin during a difficult sales environment. While we were slightly more promotional with clearance than in the prior year, rate did not have a significant impact, as we had a very strong price management in feed and other categories and strong markdown management related to several in-store events. The mix of merchandise had a negative impact of 11 basis points on gross margin. This was driven by the strong sales in C.U.E. product, specifically animal feed and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. The weakness in winter seasonal sales did not have a material impact on gross margin, as the soft sales in low-margin categories, such as heating, were offset by the soft sales in high-margin categories, such as insulated outerwear. Freight was slightly unfavorable. Lower diesel prices offset the stem mile increase from our Western store expansion, but the higher mix of animal feed and pet food led to modest increase in freight expense. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin, as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. Import purchases in the quarter increased 22.3%, as some of the spring receipts came in early than last year. Imports represented 5.5% (sic) [15.5%] of the sales mix. Also, exclusive brand sales increased 3.9% and were approximately 29.4% of the sales mix. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 23.6% of sales, an increase of 71 basis points over the prior year's quarter. We estimate that comp sales decline had an overall deleveraging impact on SG&A of approximately 35 basis points. We were very pleased with our payroll management in Q4, as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends. We were essentially flat year-over-year as a percent of sales. We did incur start-up expenses for our Southwest distribution center and the two mixing centers. Operational costs of these facilities, as well as the Hagerstown DC expansion, resulted in de-leveraging of approximately 25 basis points. We also experienced slightly higher rental leverage from the new stores as they ramped to maturity. This was driven primarily by the Western store openings which, as we discussed, generally open with a higher rent-to-sales ratio. The deleverage was offset by incentive compensation. As a result, the Q4 performance was well below the run rate of the previous quarters. We estimate the year-over-year leverage was 37 basis points. Certain occupancy costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance, decreased as a percent of sales as a result of the warmer winter. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 36.7% last year, due to additional state and federal tax credits and a reduction in the FIN 48 reserve. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $63.8 million and $150 million outstanding debt, compared to a cash balance of $51.1 million and no outstanding debt at the end of last year. Since our revolver is due to mature in October this year, the $150 million outstanding debt is shown as a current liability. In the event that we refinance this obligation before the issuance of our 10-K, a portion of or the entire amount may be classified as long-term. During the fourth quarter on the stock repurchase program, we acquired 565,000 shares for $48.7 million. Inventory per store, including inventory in transit, increased by approximately 7%. In-transit merchandise is included in the calculation to be more comparable, as we had several Q1 receipts in December that were in transit at last year-end. An increase in cold weather seasonal categories accounted for 250 basis points of the increase, while the inventory build at our new Southwest DC was approximately 100 basis points of the increase. The remaining increase is principally from investment in key categories to support the core sales. Capital expenditures for the year were $236.5 million, compared to $160.6 million last year. We opened 26 stores and closed two Del's stores and one TSC store in the fourth quarter, compared to 22 new stores opened and one Del's store closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, we opened 114 stores and closed five Del's stores and three TSC stores. The CapEx increase this year relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest DC and the two mixing centers, three incremental self-developed new stores related to the Del's transition, and various IT projects and related hardware. Turning our attention to 2016. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to fund our ongoing operational initiatives such as logistics, merchandise systems and omnichannel to position the company for future growth and, at the same time, manage the business to deliver our targeted mid-teens EPS growth. We expect full-year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecast the comp sales range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting 20 basis point to 25 basis point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 and 120 new stores with approximately 50% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We will continue to transition Del's stores to Tractor Supply markets, and we expect to close 15 Del's stores as we backfill the Northwest. Additionally, we forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%. We are initially targeting $230 million to $250 million of capital expenditures in 2016. As we stated in our long-term capital plan, we look to manage annual capital expenditures in the $230 million to $280 million range in order to be ratable in our allocation of capital and leverage depreciation expense over the next several years. In 2016, we will not have the significant cash investment of a distribution center. The key initiatives we have identified for 2016 include LED lighting retrofit for half the chain and other store energy saving initiatives, store sales initiatives and resets, and new store capital related to higher number of retrofit stores. We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter and target the year-end debt position to range between $200 million and $250 million. For modeling purposes, we estimate that the diluted shares outstanding, inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity, will be between 134 million to 134.5 million for the full year. Let me discuss some of the assumptions that helped us form our projection for 2016. Although our customer may have more discretionary income as a result of lower gas prices, we believe the consumer is more cautious, as they are concerned about the direction of the economy and world events. As a retailer that serves our customers' everyday basic needs, we believe that we'll be able to continue to serve a key segment of our customers' lifestyle. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, fiscal year 2016 will be the year that we add a 53rd week to our retail fiscal year. The fourth quarter will also have an additional comparable sales day as a result of this calendar shift. Based on our current modeling, we estimate the EPS benefit in Q4 to be approximately $0.03 to $0.04. Last year, deflation moderated and averaged approximately 35 basis points. This year, we expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. Although we expect the oil patch stores to continue to perform below chain average, it is difficult to estimate the overall impact of sales and earnings, as lower oil prices should have a favorable impact on transportation cost and consumer disposable income which could favorably impact the remaining 90% of the chain. Other than extremely warm weather in Q4, there were no significant weather events that we will be cycling. As we've stated in the past, we generally benefit from an early spring. We are hopeful that the weather pattern as a result of El Ni\u00f1o will bring an early start to spring. Although the first quarter has gotten off to a solid start, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather. As we've emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halves, not the quarters. We would expect improvements in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, including price management, continued strong markdown and inventory management, strategic sourcing, and exclusive brands. Trade expense should benefit from the lower diesel prices and the reduction of outbound stem miles, as the result of opening the Southwest DC, which should be substantially offset by increased inbound transportation cost. We are targeting a 20 basis point to 25 basis point improvement in gross margin for the full year, net of the expected headwind from increased transportation cost and the mix of merchandise. In terms of cadence for gross margin percent improvement, we forecast a year-over-year improvement each quarter, with Q4 showing the smallest increase. Additionally, we are more comfortable in our ability to improve Q1 margins as the cold weather in late January has provided improved sell-through of winter merchandise. Although the January sales have reduced the carryover of some of the winter season merchandise, it still may be challenging to improve inventory turns. We will not sacrifice in-stock levels for improved turns, and we will continue to invest in key merchandise categories to drive sales and traffic. With respect to SG&A, we continue to target maintaining SG&A growth in line with our sales growth. We may have slight SG&A deleverage this year and estimate that we would need at least a 4% comp sales increase to leverage SG&A in 2016. Two factors to consider are : this will be the first year of operations of the Southwest distribution center. This will increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis, while improving gross margin through reduced transportation expense. We expect a net EPS decrease of approximately $0.04. We will continue to transition the Del's stores to Tractor Supply stores. We expect to close 15 Del's stores which will negatively impact EPS $0.015, allocating a $0.005 to Q1 and a $0.01 to Q4. With respect to SG&A by quarter, we believe that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter to leverage SG&A, as it has a lower sales base, and we'll be operating the new Southwest distribution center and have not yet cycled two mixing centers in our Hagerstown DC operations. We expect SG&A year-over-year growth will be the largest in Q4 as a result of the incremental year-over-year incentive compensation and Del's closings. As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period at each quarterly conference call. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Guys, good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, it sounds like your expectation is any stores that are leveraged to the oil patch are going to bottom out, may not get better soon but may not get worse from here. Is that the correct assessment of what you're seeing? And along those lines, do you have any other clusters of stores that are levered to areas that are dependent on, one, either commodity or industrial segment of the economy that are exhibiting similar trends to those stores in the oil patch? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah, Michael. This is Tony. The information that we're providing, we generally tend not to give too specific geographic information. But we have been getting a lot of questions, obviously, on Texas and the economy down in Texas. What we've noticed is that it's been a slow decline over the past few quarters. We can't necessarily project whether that will continue. We're just basically giving you some data point for the quarter itself. As we look forward in the modeling, as you can estimate, we're somewhere in about the 400 basis points to 450 basis points difference or delta between the oil patch stores and the base of core stores themselves and with the control groups that we compare to. And generally, that's what we are modeling for 2016. When it comes to any other type of dependency relative to commodity, we really don't have any significant categories that we would be related to. And again, as in the past, for us, it's generally driven by unemployment in any particular economy. So if a plant goes out of business in a particular market, that would affect the store, but I don't think there's any specific dependency on a commodity itself. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then the gross margin performance sounds like it's going to be quite good this year, especially as you're able to work through some of the excess inventory that's not going to be an impediment to seeing expansion. So where are the biggest drivers? Is it that all the systems and investments you've made in the last two years are kicking in in a more meaningful way, or are there some other factors that are having influence? Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Hey, Michael. This is Steve Barbarick. Every year, we talk about some of our margin drivers that being \u2013 you heard Greg talking about what we're going to do in exclusive brands, and it's still an opportunity for us to index higher there. The tools that we have today, whether it be price optimization or clearance price optimization, continue to work in our favor and act as a tailwind as we work forward. Strategic sourcing, we continue to see that as an opportunity. There has been some currency changes. While it's not a big part of our business and it's not material, we have gone back to our suppliers and challenged them and received some price decreases there as well. And finally, just overall better management and using science behind what we're doing, I think, is really benefiting us. So those are, I guess you could say, the buckets of opportunity we're looking at, and we manage this on a daily basis. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : My last question is, Steve, there was some mention of being a little bit more promotional in the fourth quarter. And so, are you taking the posture that you're going to reinvest some of the savings back into the business and continue to be more promotional? Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Well, what we did \u2013 and Q4 was interesting. We took some strategic markdowns on some clearance activity that we had, knowing that we had Christmas right here in front of us as well. Because a lot of the seasonal products, such as men's shirts, ladies' shirts, while we're not in the fashion business and we're not hung out with a lot of inventory there, we also saw it as an opportunity to fiscally be responsible, take some key markdowns in the quarter and make sure that we pushed out as much of that product as we could. What we did carry forward mainly is in our insulated, as Tony said, and heating business. So we will use the dollars that we've got strategically. But you heard Tony talk about the look forward and what the margin forecasts are, and that's as best as we can give you at this point. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks for all the commentary. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good evening, guys. So first, a clarification question on the extra day in the fourth quarter. So when you report comps, will you give it on a comparable days basis for the fourth quarter, i.e., the same number of days? Or is that extra comp day an add-on to the overall comp that you report? And thus, when you're guiding to 3.5% to 5%, does that include an extra day that would help the overall fourth quarter report? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Chris, this is Tony. It does get a little complicated, and I know that Christine cannot wait to handle these calls on the extra week. But I want to say the answer is yes to both of your questions. We will have the same comparable days when we report 2016 comparing to 2015, the same weeks and the same days. In this case, there is obviously one extra day in 2016 where we were closed last year at this time. So, it will be included in our comp sales increase as well. So I want to say that the answer is yes to both of your questions. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So I guess asked more directly, when you guide the 3.5% to 4% for the year, I mean if I just do one day over 365 days, is that essentially a net benefit of 25 basis points to 30 basis points to your comp guide for the year? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Potentially. But I want to say that the one day is in the last part of the year, and it's not a particularly strong day. It's in the last week of that year and may not be a strong day. But generally, you can look at it in that respect relative to the fourth quarter. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood, understood. And then as a follow-up is you referenced the Texas oil patch versus the South. So does it sound like the South decelerated as well for the chain? And that's why \u2013 I mean one would have expected the overall South to be doing better, and it sounded like Texas gapped out (33:35) versus the overall chain. But it also sounded like the Southern region also gapped out (33:41). So is that accurate? And what stores for you are \u2013 or what states for you are in the Southern region? Thanks. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. What we were trying to outline, because we didn't want to be misleading and be a little bit more transparent, obviously the chain \u2013 because of the cold weather up north, the overall chain comp was fairly low. So we felt that if we compared it to the Southern stores, it'd be a more fair comparison. So that's all we're trying to highlight there. We felt that the South did relatively well. It was a positive comp. And we thought a very reasonable comp relative to the performance of the company. Generally, when we talk South, we're talking pretty much Florida through Georgia, all the way to Louisiana. So we think that it's a reasonable comparison. We've also done some additional detail analysis where we try to identify what we believe are good control stores. And we came up generally with the same delta between the oil patch stores and the chain. So generally, the general direction again is there is a delta between the oil patch stores. But Texas as a whole, I think some of the key messaging around it is that non-oil patch Texas stores perform well. And they're right up there, actually slightly above chain average, as well as the transactions are positives across the board as well. So even in some of the oil patch stores, we're driving transactions. And that's what brings us to our assessment that it really relates more to the oil-related merchandise, which tends to be higher ticket. And that we're still getting the transactions and the footsteps coming through the stores. So we feel pretty good about Texas and the way it's performing, giving what we hear relative to some of the other companies that are struggling in the oil patch areas. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Chris. This is Greg. Just to kind of clarify, too. These Texas stores have been in place for a number of years in these oil patch regions. So as that business accelerated due to the drilling and all the things that were occurring there, we kind of rode the wave up. We're now riding kind of on the backside of that bell curve down. And these are still very viable, very profitable stores. But they're not comping at the same level they may have been as they got to the peak of this oil surge, as we'll call it. So don't be confused. We're still very happy with Texas, very happy with the stores in the oil patch. They're just at a different level today than they were the last couple of years because of the activity down there. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. So two questions. First, I think for Tony, just on the D&A, which is starting to pick up here with the new DC coming in. Can you give us some help? Where do you see that coming in in 2016? I mean you talked about you're managing the CapEx so you can try to leverage D&A. But so would you leverage D&A at the midpoint of your sales guidance for next year? That's my first question. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. Peter, relative to the D&A, we're looking a little bit higher than sort of the 10% to 12% range. So there will probably be a little bit of deleverage related to the depreciation. And again, that's going to be driven by the new DC coming on. So it's not overly significant, but it probably will run higher than the sales increase and thus the deleveraging. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. No, that makes sense. And then, Steve, just on the merchandising test, can you talk a little bit more \u2013 whatever you're comfortable talking about \u2013 in terms of the pet resets? What exactly is going on there? You talked about localization. What's driving those decisions? Was it some system stuff? Was it learning some HTT? Just give us a little bit more on the pet resets coming up for 2016. Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Yeah, sure, Peter. First of all, I mean, understand that we don't have a silver bullet philosophy at Tractor. You've heard us say that before. We have a lot of tests and a lot of activities going out there. So while Greg referenced the pet business and the reset that we're doing there, there's a variety of other things we're doing inside the store. Relative to pet itself, we do see an opportunity. Typically, once or twice a year, we'll go through and do a fairly comprehensive assortment review on that business. We do see an opportunity for some expansion and some super premium brands that we have today, as well as expanding our exclusive brand of 4health, both in dry and in wet. So as an organization, we're constantly refining, and we believe in continuous improvement, and this is just one example of it. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. Hey, guys. A lot of talk about January being off to a stronger start. Tony, you snuck in a comment about the consumer being a little bit more cautious. Just wondering if you can elaborate on that point, and if there is something else that you may be seeing in certain categories or in big ticket that you're referring to. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah, it's interesting. We try, based on the data that we have, to see if there's any significant changes in the consumer. During the fourth quarter, obviously, the winter product didn't sell. But at the same time, we saw some strong sales in big ticket, and we alluded to trailers and some outdoor recreation equipment. In particular, we had some UTVs and even some riding lawn mowers that were selling in the fourth quarter. So, our assessment is that the consumer is still cautious. We know that they are either paying off credit cards or putting more dollars towards savings. But at the same time, they are willing to step forward to make some of the large ticket purchases. As we enter in, obviously, reading on the economy and on the consumer, it appears as if consumer confidence is starting to wane a little bit so we understand that they're going to be more cautious. But I think our perspective really is that they have basic needs and they continue to fulfill those needs and that we feel that we're properly positioned as that supplier of everyday basic needs for the rural lifestyle. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, understood. And then a question on the West Coast DC, I think you've outlined some of the costs for 2016. Can you walk us through some of the potential sales benefits, if any, and whether that's reflected in the guidance? For example, stores being fulfilled by this DC historically have been much further away. I mean how does the replenishment cycle may be changed, and are there opportunities for maybe better localization and things like that? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Seth. This is Greg. I think the key difference here is that having a DC that is within a 250- to 400-mile range of our stores, as you look up and down the coast and as we go up and through the Montana/Utah areas, is the benefit here is we can run product to those stores on a more timely basis. And if there's something that happens within their sales trends that needs to be addressed more readily than once a week, like trucks moving from Waco or from Waverly, that's a big advantage. The distance between our store and our DC now is much closer. We can push goods to those stores much faster. And we'll learn from the replenishment cycles here, how many days we can take off of that. But being closer has its advantages, particularly if there's a weather event or something that we have to react to when business tends to trend faster than what maybe we've seen from a steady state before. So that's the advantage. I can't tell you how much sales it will or won't bring. That's a hard thing to judge at this point. We've only got 50-some odd stores running today. We'll have 120 stores by midyear, so we'll know more really toward the midyear. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks and good luck. Operator : We'll go next to Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities. Jessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good evening. My first question is on the test of the loyalty program. I was wondering with your strong transaction trends, if there's anything you've been able to learn in these early reads about new and existing customers. Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Jessica, we're still very early into this at this point. Because we never had 100% attribution before, now we're getting that with these customers that are part of the club. So now, we're going to know how often they shop and what their purchasing patterns look like. So at this point, it's difficult to say. We can bounce it against our existing database. But again, we're still very, very early into the game at this point. Jessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right. And then my second question is on the exclusive brand portfolios and the opportunity for 2016. You talked a little bit about the pet reset, but anything else in the pipeline that you expect to drive that business this year? Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Yeah. I mean, again, we've got a number of exclusive brands and a product development team that's constantly working to refine what we're doing there. We recently, in Q4, had a tool event in Q4, and we did really well with some of our tool brands in the event itself. We rolled out TotalCare, which is a premium bird feed line that's a sub-brand under Royal Wing. What you're going to find later in the year is or do more line of livestock feed, and equine feed is going to be relaunched and we're very excited about that. And finally, another thing that we did just recently is our Retriever product which is also in the pet food line. We're trying to treat a lot of our brands to be more of a national brand. And so we did some bonus bags and we tried some different things with the line of Retriever, and we found that we saw a nice increase in sales of that product, and some of which we took from our grocery brands which really benefited us. So there's a lot of activity going on right now. And as Tony mentioned, for us to achieve our margin goals for 2016, we're going to have to really put the pedal down here. Jessica Schoen Mace - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Vartan Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So wanted to just quickly follow up on the pet assortments. Net net, does this mean that more stores will be getting premium product? Is that the right way to think about it? I know you sort of stratified the stores into kind of three different buckets. That's an interesting tidbit we picked up when we were down there. Any way sort of to talk through kind of what the tangible outcome of this? I heard the more premium brands, which is great, but anything else you can share would be great. Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Well, the only thing I probably would share is, in addition to the expansion of some existing brands like Blue Buffalo and Taste of the Wild, we're going to be launching Natural Balance this year, which is a new brand that we haven't had. We're excited about the launch. We know that there's some pretty good market share out there today, and that product will be rolling in in the next couple of weeks. And we also look, like I said earlier, about our 4health line which continues to perform very, very well. And I would tell you we believe it's bringing in even new customers that never shopped our stores before because it's got a good penetration nationally at this point. So a lot of work being done. We continue to dense pack the footage that we're using inside the store, and we're getting better dollars and profit per square foot as a result. Stephen Vartan Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And just lastly, as I think about sort of the cadence of sales, obviously January did start a bit warmer. Any color on how you think about the comp in the first quarter versus the full-year guidance? Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Yeah. I'll take that. This is Steve. You've heard Greg say earlier that the colder weather in January did benefit us. Tony said the same. But I just remind everyone that we had a relatively cold February last year as well. And as Tony said, Q1 also includes spring business. And March is a very important month for us. We typically like to be judged on the half and not on the quarter as a result of the way our fiscal quarters work. So that's what I would say to this point. It's still very early in the game here on this one. Stephen Vartan Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. It's Joshua Siber on for Simeon. The 3.5% to 5% comp guidance that you guys laid out, that's better than what's been initiated the last couple of years. Did you raise it to acknowledge that you're going to push the business harder from a merchandising perspective, or is it just increased confidence overall? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : I think there may be a few of those considerations as well. But obviously, we were disappointed in the sales in the fourth quarter because of the weather. And we're hoping that some of the normalization you'll see at the fourth quarter bounces back next year. We've added that component to our full-year forecast as well. So, I think that's one of the main drivers as well as the initiatives that Steve's been talking about as well. We do have the extra week, so you obviously you need extra comp days. So those are the considerations, and those would be the reasons why the comp tends to be just a little bit higher than what we normally have forecasted. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. My follow-up, just looking back, you faced warm winters in the past. So I'm curious if there's anything different about how things played out in terms of customer behavior or your response to the weather in Q4. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Josh, this is Greg. I would say that this was the most \u2013 I've been with the company now going into my ninth year. I have not seen a winter develop quite like this where we had a very, very warm November and relatively warm December. So two months back to back, where temperatures were somewhat similar coast to coast, that's quite unusual. And El Ni\u00f1o effect was clearly there. We expected we would see some cooling down in December more than we did see at the end of the year. But I haven't had two years that I could tell you have been the same since I've been here with the company. And it's our job \u2013 and we talk about this a lot in the management group here and with the team, a lot about we have to address the business as if weather is a factor, but it can't be something that gets in the way of us doing business. Our customers buy close to need. The reason they weren't buying some of the cold weather product in November-December is they had no need for it. They now have a need for it because it's cooled down. We did a great job managing the inventories, kept things close. So really, I can't tell you there's any kind of pattern. Yes, we've had some warmer winters in the past but nothing quite like this one. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. The first question is you talked about this three cold weather categories, the 400 basis point impact. Historically, how big have those three categories been in the fourth quarter? Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we generally don't disclose the specifics. Obviously, we have the seasonal categories. That runs about 20% to 23% overall for the full year. But that obviously includes the spring which includes a lot of the lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, et cetera. But as sort of a bellwether, you can look at the seasonal piece. There's some pieces in there that probably are year-round seasonal type businesses. That can be replaced by other categories that aren't necessarily included, some of the clothing categories that are broken out. So you're somewhere of a range in that level, but we don't disclose the specifics. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just to try and clarify I think an answer you provided earlier, Tony, your comment that the customer is more cautious. I'm assuming that we should view that as an actual change in your view on the consumer and that it does go beyond just what you commented on the oil patch. Is that correct? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. I would characterize it as last year, when we came into the year, the consumer confidence index was much higher. Oil prices were starting to come down. It appears as if the consumer \u2013 that it potentially would be a stronger year, and that is something that's in the back of our minds when we start to put our 2016 forecast and model together. As we came into this year, we still think that there are some positives. But at the same time, we do believe that the consumer could become more cautious during the year, and therefore that plays or enters into our equation as we do our forecasting modeling as well. So we could tend to be a little bit more conservative relative to how we started last year. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And yet your guidance of the 3.5% to 5% comp includes a more conservative consumer? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Correct. And as we talked earlier, the additional week, the additional comp day, the softness in last year's fourth quarter, it is the reason why the comp forecast is consistent with last year's forecast. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go next to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Good evening, everyone. So to go back to the comp again, is it fair to assume that 1Q will potentially be below the range and 4Q above the range with the second and third within the range? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : In this case \u2013 again, we don't give the specific guidance, but all four quarters are in a reasonable range within the range. Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Hey, Adam. It's going to depend upon if we get the spring weather in March. Tony always talked about we need to see something. That'll help, no question, for Q1. But you've got to believe that fourth quarter \u2013 it'd be unusual if we had another fourth quarter quite like this. So... Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : ...we would say, yeah, we would see opportunity there. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So just, I mean again, just very sort of unscientific, but looking at AccuWeather, going to be in the mid-40s and 50s through February in Columbus, Ohio, and in New York. We know you have a tough February. We know you have a tough March. Obviously, a lot depends on March. Is January above 3% to 5%? Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great question, but we won't answer that one, Adam. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, okay. That's fine. That's fine. Okay, fine. And then just one thing that I've heard Tony sort of answer through the Q&A. He keeps on talking about the additional week and the additional day in relation to the comp guidance. But I thought the additional day was maybe like 20 basis points. And because you're lining up the week, the additional week doesn't really add anything. Is that correct? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : That would be correct. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then just lastly on gross margin, why would fourth quarter be the lowest increase of the year? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. Probably a good question. And we take a look at some of the detail. There's several components. And a lot of them are, I want to say, relatively small. We try to hit the highlights as we do detail analysis and work through some of the other impacts throughout the quarter. There's some variances. So when we look at next year, it's really hard to match it up. But they are \u2013 a lot of other impacts that are in the quarter. It could be as basic relative to new store discounts that flow through. We go back and we've been working with our vendors overseas, looking at discounts and getting adjustments for foreign currency. So it's a lot of these minor issues that impact margin that will make it a little bit more difficult comparison as we go into Q4. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : And we'll go next to Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Jaime Katz - Morningstar Research : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. So I'm curious, you guys talked about drawing on your revolver maybe at slightly higher levels than in the past over the next few quarters. And I'm curious if there's been any difference in working capital intensity or how that's changed for you guys. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : There hasn't really been a significant change. Obviously as we worked our way through Q4 with the softer sales and the higher inventory levels, there's going to be an impact there. But our general philosophy is to continue to drive improved turns, although again it will be a challenge this year as far as improving turns as we work through some of the inventory coming out of the winter season. So there's been no change there. Where we've been focused over the last couple years is to continue purchasing under the share repurchase program. And that's really been the major driver as far as use of cash. Jaime Katz - Morningstar Research : Okay. And then in the past, I know you guys had called out maybe the Northwest in 2017 for a possible distribution center and then maybe the Northeast thereafter. But I'm wondering if the ordering or anything like that has changed? And where you're finding the best opportunities to build out your footprint right now versus maybe where you thought they were last year, just if rents have gotten better in one location over the other? Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jaime, hi. This is Greg. As we said, we're going through our typical three- to four-year study right now. And I think once we're through that, we'll have better answers. Right now, with the West DC in place, particularly sitting there in Arizona, we can service a number of stores on the Western seaboard. But let us get through this analysis. We'll have probably more to talk about about midyear. And we'll probably bring that topic up again at that time. Jaime Katz - Morningstar Research : Excellent. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good evening, everyone. Just a quick question in looking at the fourth quarter customer behavior with the categories you mentioned being influenced by the warm weather. How does that relate to how customers put together their baskets and traffic if they're not in there for some of the cold stuff? Are there attachment rates that would accrue to a purchase of a heater or a stove that we just didn't see because of the weather? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Well, yeah. When we look at the basket and look at the transactions, it's very clear that we're still getting the footsteps. And so again our customer is coming in for their everyday needs. And the driver relative to some of the cold winter product really is related to the ticket. And the drivers that we talked about, some of the big ticket was 70 basis points on the average ticket. So we're still driving in the footsteps. And obviously we're very pleased with the positive transaction count increase. Obviously the basket might not be as big as they come into the store, because of the decline in some of the winter seasonal goods. But again it's really the strong transaction count that is driving the business. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thank you. With the online efforts and what you're doing and the growth that you're seeing there \u2013 and I recognize that it's still a small piece of the business \u2013 but curious as you've started to dig into this, what you're seeing in terms of an evolution of your customers' desires or interests in online? And how big of an opportunity you think this is? And if you're thinking about that has changed as you've started to become more involved within this? Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Eric, this is Greg. I would tell you that we are very delighted. As we have started to build up the content piece of the business and getting more information about product, that that is kind of helping us push through into the social space, as well as driving some commerce. So I said it's less than 1%. It's growing rapidly. We had to get the new platform up. Rob Mills' team did a wonderful job working with Letitia, who is our VP of that area, really getting this platform up and running. We've still got some tooling to do to it. What we're seeing is customers are going to the Web to research. Then from the Web, they're starting to look at the option of buying it online, picking it up at the store or having it shipped to the store. Right now, we can give them the option of ship to store. We can't give them pick up at store. And there's a difference. One is shipping it to the store from a DC or from a third party. The other is it's actually being held there at the store for the customer when they bought online. So we are seeing that. And then this whole special order component that's coming online later this year. I'm very excited about. It's one of the areas that our stores struggle with daily, trying to leaf through books and catalogs and that. They'll take all of that out of the way. And they'll be able to go to the screen there at the service center that's in the middle of the store and pull information up, address the customer. The customer can transact there. And we'll be able to even give them an ETA of when it's going to be there and so on. No one in our space is doing anything quite like this, and it's pretty exciting. But how big will it be over time? Hard to say. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Joseph Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Yeah. Thanks, guys. I have a \u2013 wanted to ask also about e-commerce actually. Again early days in it, I understand that. But anything you can share about the type of customer that you're seeing? Or maybe what the customer is purchasing, if that's different in any ways than you would have expected, or exactly even what it is relative to what you see purchasing in the stores. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Joe, it's Greg. A couple of things we've noticed. They have no issue, no problem at all, buying large ticket, big ticket items because we have a delivery process that we can get the product to them, basically drop-shipping it or taking it LTL, whether it's a safe or riding lawn mower, what have you. They don't have that advantage necessarily when they buy that at the store. That's typically bring your own truck, bring your trailer, or we can arrange for a delivery from the store to your property. So that kind of surprised, I think, all of us. We still have a high component of footwear and apparel that's coming through. But they're buying across the store, ironically. And I think the more that we put product content out there and we're able to draw that in and expand the envelope with the endless aisles and some categories of things with tractor parts or some of that hard-to-find type of items that the only tractor will probably have versus some other store, that's where the real opportunity is going to be. It's a true area for destination for us as we can evolve this. And I think it's quite exciting. We're not doing things like feed and food necessarily in a big way. We are selling some pet food, but this is really the kind of things that only Tractor Supply sells or that the customer is saying, boy, it's easier for me just to buy it online and have it delivered to my property. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it. Thanks. And then just another sort of unrelated question. But you touched on rolling out a new special order system in the stores. And I just wanted to get a little more color on that, like what's involved with that rollout and how that will work, and training maybe, and expense related to that, and what specific items people do need to use that system for. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, today, we have a special order business that is, I would say, not substantial, but significant. But it's done in a very cumbersome way. We put the burden on the store to really do the research, to make the phone calls. And there's some things we can work with them on to get store support center to aid that process. But it's clunky. The new process will be very fast, very easy for both the team member and the customer at the store, and it can transact at the store, and it's going to give us real-time data. We lock in the order. Here's the price it's being sold at. Here's the ETA of delivery into your home or to our store for pickup. We think it's going to be used primarily, again, for the kinds of things that you can't find in the store or the kinds of quantities of things that you're buying that you need quite a few of. If someone comes in for rake teeth on a particular piece of equipment, and we have maybe 20 in the store but they want 100, that's something you can go ahead and just place as a special order and get it to them. Or if it's a \u2013 we carry five SKUs of the category and we now have the ability through the longer tail to have all 50 SKUs. The customer has the choice to be able to buy deeper into that category or from that vendor. So I'm excited about it. I can't tell you how large that can be over time, but I do think that our guys in IT have done a wonderful job working with the stores to understand the need, to understand how this needs to work, take the work out of it for both them and the customer, make it easy. And I think it's going to be something we'll be talking about at greater length as we get toward the end of the year. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Great. Thank you for the update and good luck with the quarter. Operator : We'll go next to David Magee with SunTrust. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, everybody. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Hey, Dave. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: A couple of questions. One is you mentioned deflation this year being a lesser dynamic, less throughout the year. Can you just quickly talk about some of the puts and takes there? What's the biggest variable in determining that? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Clearly, the biggest variable is the impact on feed, and that's what's moderated. Obviously, oil prices have come down. So oil-related products, there's some deflation in that category. But it tends not to be as impactful as what we had experienced with feed. So we anticipate that it'll be flattening out over the course of the year. Obviously, that's going to be dependent on where oil goes. And obviously, each conference call, we'll update you as to what we expect out of deflation or inflation. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, Tony. And then just secondly, with regard to the Neighbor's Club project that's going on now, if this turns out to be a big success over the next year or so, what metrics do you think will be moved by it at the store level? Is it primarily traffic, or do you think margins might be enhanced? How do you see that evolving? Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Well, this is Steve. One of the values of having the loyalty program and a pilot is to test exactly that. Right now, we're getting our first seasonal rewards out to the customers that have adopted or signed into the program, and we're going to see what response rates we get. The other thing strategically that we talked a lot about internally is the importance of personalization, and Greg's talked a lot about the digital side of our business and what we're doing on the Web. Getting these e-mail addresses and being able to talk to consumers the way they want to be talked to on their purchase history, we are finding that we've got a lot better open rates on the e-mails that we're sending out. And we believe by continuing to talk to them in a way they want to be talked to, we should see better traffic in our stores and increase in sales. So again, part of the pilot and what we're trying to learn right now before we roll it out to more stores is to quantify what that's going to look like. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Steve. Good luck. Steve K. Barbarick - Executive Vice President & Chief Merchandising Officer : Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot and thanks for taking my questions. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: The first issue I'd like to ask about is new store productivity. By our math, it looked like there was a bit of a step-down in new store productivity this quarter. Curious to know if there's any rationale for that with timing of store openings or anything else. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yes, Seth. When we look at the overall productivity of the new stores, in aggregate, our new stores are hitting our pro forma. So we feel very good about that. There are some pockets in particular in one of our new markets that we went into over the last year-and-a-half, Utah has come out slower than we had anticipated. So that's pulled the numbers down a little bit. And so, sometimes in some markets, it's going to take a while to build and strengthen our positioning in particular markets. But the one thing that we really like is how the stores have comped particularly in the West as well. So in some cases, the stores may come out a little bit lighter in sales than we had anticipated, but overall, they're coming out consistent with our pro forma, and they are ramping at a nice clip. So as we look overall at productivity, what's important to us is as we approve the stores that they live up to the pro forma that we've designed for each store. And generally, over the years, we open up stores somewhere between $2.8 million and $3.2 million. Each year's groups of stores is going to vary, but we'll generally be in that range. So I would expect as our chain continues to grow substantially that the productivity will sort of stay in this range or at times flatten out a bit. But relative to 2015, there's nothing in that mix of stores that caused any sort of differentiation to how the stores have performed in the past. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got you. I would think that in the fourth quarter, with the West doing so well and a lot of your stores concentrated at West \u2013 your new stores concentrated at West, that should be a benefit to new store productivity. But it seemed to be a step-down. Does that suggest that there is any further weakness in the Utah region or any other spot of the new store opening fleet? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : No. What we experienced was nice comps. And like I had said, if the stores come out a little bit less than what had been pro forma-ed, we generally see a nice comp ramp. So again, as long as the stores are consistent with the pro forma that we have out there, we believe that we'll get a nice return. The IR will be nice and firm and continue to grow the ROIC. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Then lastly, just to make sure I got this right \u2013 I may have missed it because we got dropped. But in terms of Texas performance overall, was 350 basis points weaker in comp sales versus the normalized chain average of low-single digits in the fourth quarter? Is that correct? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. That's in the ballpark. Correct. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And you expect that sort of delta to persist through 2016? Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Correct. That is in our modeling for 2016. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Perfect. All right. Thank you very much and good luck in 2016. Anthony F. Crudele - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Greg Sandfort for closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, operator. As we look ahead to 2016, we are excited about our opportunity for growth. We will continue to invest in infrastructure, system improvements and the omnichannel to move our business forward as we target mid-teens earning growth. Thank you for your support of Tractor Supply, and we all look forward to speaking to you again in April regarding our first quarter of 2016 performance. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

I'm now pleased to introduce Greg Sandfort, Tractor Supply Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Greg, please go ahead. Greg Sandfort : Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. On call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain officer. We are pleased with our result and execution of our business in the first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% and were driven by increases in both traffic and ticket. This was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable transaction count. Our sales were balanced across product categories and regions with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales. Once again the Tractor Supply team did an excellent job managing the business this quarter and we believe our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.  Our customers rely on us to be the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for their rural lifestyle needs. They shop our stores regularly and they buy what they need, when they needed for their pets, animals, land and equipment. Some of their needs are year around. Some are seasonal and some are weather related. We know these seasons and weather can influence a timing of when our customers shop certain products and we also know it is our job to manage our inventory accordingly. One change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year was a flow of our seasonal inventory into our stores. Last year we had three regional set dates for spring merchandize which ranged from mid January through early February. Acting on feedback from our store managers and analyzing sales and inventory data, we changed our approach for 2016 and moved to five set dates this year. Starting with the south in late December and ending with the north in late February early March. This allowed us to capture early spring sales in the south and additional late winter sales in the north. Combining these with our clearance pricing tool from Revionics we were able to drive sales, preserve margin and reduce inventory levels as we transition our business during the first quarter. This quarter we did have a little help from mother nature. And we had the right products and stock to meet our customers' need in both seasonal and everyday CUE products. When the snow and cold finally arrived in many of our markets in January, we had the inventory to meet those customers need and we sold through a good portion of our winter seasonal merchandize. Similarly, when spring like conditions develop in the number of our southern market in March, we were again ready and our continued investments in everyday CUE products kept us positioned to drive this segment of our business throughout the quarter as well.  As a result, we experienced solid sales across both everyday and seasonal products for the quarter. This year's Chicks Day event which was another success generating strong traffic driving sales and growing awareness regarding backyard poultry across a wide range of customers. The event features live chicks and ducklings along with all the necessary products for their care and maintenance. This is one of our most popular events of the year and positions Tractor Supply as an authority in the areas of animal care and sustainable living. It speaks to the self reliance and sustainability trend that we continue to see in our marketplace and is a great example of how we are appealing to a wider consumer base.  As we discussed briefly at our Investment Community Day in February, we've identified broad consumer trends around four areas of our business. Those being pets, services, by land and sustainable living. We believe these are go forward areas of opportunity for Tractor Supply and we are developing and testing strategies for products and events that will address these trends. Another area of growing importance is the application of technology into our business including systems involving inventory management, allocation, customer information capture and mobile. We continue to improve our processes to better manage inventory, enhance our assortments and grow the business longer term. One example is our new plan-o-gram facility which we call our Merchandize Innovation Center or MIC. This facility enables our teams and vendors to work in a simulated store environment as we plan changes to our assortment mix and store visuals and overall flow changes within the four-wall store. In addition to the MIC, enhancement across our planning and allocation systems are important tools that we are utilizing to improve our business to meet the ever evolving needs of our customers.  As we look ahead to the remainder of 2016, we will continue to enhance our omni channel platform, customer relationship marketing and our IT security across the entire organization. We are also in the process of implementing the EMV chip and signature platform in our stores with completion expected by mid of this year.  On the merchandizing side, our focus will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to expand our offerings an exclusive brand always being mindful of the positioning for the key national brand that our customers expect to find within our assortment. On the store operation side of our business, we are improving our in-store special ordering process and making it easier for our team members to assist customers and locating hard to find products to expand product offerings, utilizing our drop ship vendors. And we are embarking on the largest store sustainability project to date with the retrofitting of the entire store base with new LED lighting in 2016 and 2017. Thus far we've converted one third of our stores plan for 2016 with LED lighting and those stores are benefiting from improved lighting quality as well as lower energy and maintenance cost. So in closing, let me extend my sincere thanks to all the hardworking dedicated team members of Tractor Supply and it's really our people who serve our customers everyday and execute our business strategy that drive our continued success as a company.  With that said I'd like to turn the call over to Tony now for a more detail commentary on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. Tony? Tony Crudele : Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion. Net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million, and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. Comp store sales increased 4.9% in the first quarter, compared to an increase of 5.7% in the last year's first quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 32nd consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. As Greg mentioned sale trends were broad based both from a product and a geographic perspective. Everyday items continue to perform well and were key driver the comp transaction increase. Average comp ticket increased by 73 basis points on top of last year's 84 basis points increase. The increase was driven principally by an increase in number of SKUs per transaction partially offset by deflation.  Sales of spring seasonal merchandize were also strong in the quarter as we experienced the March that was warmer than average and also warmer than last year. Spring seasonal category such as lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, fencing, animal health and fly control performed very well. Winter seasonal sales were strong in January as the cold weather rolled in but sales softened in February which was much warmer than last year. Cold weather in January gave us the opportunity to clear most of our winter clothing specifically insulated auto wear. However, the cold weather was too brief to drive significant sales in certain hard line categories such as heating and log splitters.  Other comments regarding sales in the quarter, comp sales were positive across all regions and major product categories with the strongest sales coming in the Southeast which was impacted less by the mild winter season. Big ticket comp sales increased slightly but below chain average and were driven by early spring season riding lawn mower and trailer sales, partially offset by soft sales in winter power equipment and log splitters.  Transactions drove the increase in the big ticket comps. But overall the increase in big ticket did not materially impact overall company comps. We estimate that deflation impacted sales by approximately 25 basis points driven principally by livestock feed, lubricant and propane categories. As I mentioned, mild March temperatures benefited the sales of early spring merchandize, also Easter was one week earlier than last year. Thereby shifting the strong Friday and Saturday sales days into our first quarter. We estimate that these two factors positively impacted first quarter results by pulling forward approximately $18 million in sales and $0.02 per diluted share. The oil patch stores continue to comp positive but below chain average consistent with the trend in Q4. Transaction count remains firm in these stores. We are expecting that the impact will moderate through the years as we begin to cycle the trend from last year.  Now turning to gross margin which increased 30 basis points to 33.7% versus a decrease of 8 basis points last year. The merchandize team did a great job driving gross margin while managing through our winter seasonal clearance. We benefited from our key margin initiatives and price management, import and exclusive brands. The benefit of these initiatives more than offset the impact from heavier clearance sales of winter seasonal merchandize. The merchandize team continues to work diligently with our vendor community on both the product development and cost side of the business which is improving margin. We also benefited from vendor support program associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC while we loaded the DC with inventory late last year we began shipping the stores in late December and recognizing the benefit as we sold through the merchandize in Q1. We estimate these positively impacted gross margin approximately 15 basis points. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continues to decline in the feed category.  Freight was slightly unfavorable, lower diesel prices and the decrease outbound 10 miles to our western stores more than offset by an increase inbound miles to our Arizona DC and a higher mix of freight intensive categories. The mix of merchandize had a slight negative impact on gross margin; higher sales of riding lawn mowers were offset by lower sales of heating products both of which carry below chain average margins.  For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.3% of sales, an improvement of 11 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Overall SG&A benefited from a strong comp sales increase. However, we are very pleased with the expense control and leverage that we achieved given that we had an estimated headwind of $3.5 million or approximately 24 basis points from the start up of our Arizona DC and the two mixing centers that were not in operation last year at this time. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q1, as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends resulting in leverage in the quarter. Medical and related payroll expenses levered as well.  We also leverage occupancy as we benefited from low utility and store winter maintenance expense as a result of the mild winter weather. This benefit was partially offset by the rental leverage that we experienced as we open new stores. Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in this quarter. The tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.9% last year due to additional state tax credit of both periods include one time state tax credit that we did not anticipate receiving at the same level in subsequent years.  Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $74.5 million and $230 million in outstanding debt, compared to a cash balance of $57 million and $60 million in outstanding debt last year. During the first quarter under our stock repurchase program, we acquired close to 1.2 million shares for $99.1 million. Inventory per store increased 1% and annualized inventory return decreased to 2.94. We had anticipated that turns would decrease in Q1 as we began the quarter heavy with winter season merchandize as well as stocking our new Arizona DC. We are pleased how the team managed the mark- down cadence and inventory purchases bringing the quarter imbalances down essentially to last year's levels.  We believe we are well positioned as we head into the second quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36.7 million compared to $48.8 million last year. We opened 36 stores and close three Del's stores in the first quarter compared to 41 new stores opened and one Del's store closed in the first quarter of 2015.  So with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2016 as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. While our Q1 performance was strong, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring and summer season. As we've said in the past, it is best to evaluate our performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, we expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting 20 to 25 basis points improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115-120 new stores with approximately 30% scheduled to be opened in the first half of the year. Additionally, we forecast our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%.  While we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to range between $230 million to $250 million. And we are making good progress on our LED lighting retrofit and expect to be completing this year's target of half of the chain by mid third quarter. We'll continue to make purchases under share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return, we expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter and target yearend debt position to be approximately $200 million. We continue to expect deflation to be less than the headwind ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Seth Sigman with  Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter guys. You discussed the change in the flow of seasonal inventory into the stores. It seems that was pretty powerful change to help manage some of the weather volatility in the quarter. Is there a way to quantify the benefit in Q1? And do you see other opportunities in other quarters for changing the flow? Steve Barbarick : Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. I'd tell you it's really hard to quantify that specifically. As Greg mentioned in year's past we had three waves over two weeks, this year we went to five waves over eight weeks. Our planning department and our inventory teams have really matured to a level where we are able to do this. And we got the technology now to do it. I would tell you what we experienced in Q1 was quite favorable for us. And that something we will do going forward. And in the back half of the year I think we got a pretty good plan. We made some adjustments in the year's past and I don't see us making a lot of changes for the fall. Seth Sigman : Got it. Okay. And then just one question on SG&A. I think the original guidance imply minimal leverage in 2016. I think you said Q1 was going to be most difficult year to get leverage. Obviously, Q1's SG&A leverage was pretty good. Tony, are you finding other opportunities here? And is it fair to think about potentially more expense leverage throughout the year just based on the comp outlook? Tony Crudele : When we look at we obviously have a lot of initiatives that we have in place to try to drive cost out of SG&A. However, as we indicated in the first conference call as we look out over the year, we do anticipate SG&A being somewhat flattish to potentially negative and that should moderate some as we move through the year as we start to cycle against the Arizona Distribution Center and the mixing centers. And again I remind you that probably the fourth quarter we have the best potential to leverage SG&A because we have the additional sales week of the 53rd week. Operator : We will take a next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey, guys. Quick question on the gross margin which was obviously really good in the quarter. I am curious about the vendor support program that we are in the -- that Greg I think you mentioned in the press release. Are those short term type things or is there some duration to that? Can you maybe help us a little bit more on what the vendor support program entail? Greg Sandfort : Yes, Peter, I am not going to get in specifics necessarily but I would say that we are constantly working with our vendors to improve not just our cost but incentives to what we do. We did go back as we knew that the Arizona Distribution Center would be somewhat costly and ask for some support there. So that's specifically Tony mentioned was a one time deal. Tony Crudele : And so Peter this is Tony. As it flows through to our inventory and our turns generally that type of vendor support would cycle through in about three to four months period. So the majority would be captured in the first quarter. Peter Benedict : Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then Tony just with the debt it is on the balance sheet now and you gave kind of the year end target. What are you thinking in terms of interest expense for the year? And then longer term, how should we think about your appetite and leverage to this model as we go forward? Thank you. Tony Crudele : Sure. Obviously, we anticipate interest expense to increase but not dramatically because as much as we anticipate having outstanding balances at the end of each quarter. There are periods where we have obviously the strong sales as we move to spring where we would not be in a borrow position. So we don't see is being a significant increase relative to an appetite. I think that one of the biggest drivers is the share repurchase program and so that would be a driver and again given how we set up the program, using the metrics and how the stock price move dictate how much we attribute to that program. And that would drive some of the outstanding debt on the balance sheet. So I think we clearly would like to support the stock and continue to do so. But we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the capital structure because of repurchase program. Operator : We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Siber : Hey, this is Joshua Siber on for Simeon. Can you parse out the $80 million sales difference between the Easter impact and the warm weather impact? Tony Crudele : Joshua, this is Tony. Little difficult to do and I'd tell you it is really our best estimate this time and until we see how the full season plays out, it really is just that is an estimate. Again, hard to quantify if I gave you my best thought on it, it would probably one third Easter and the other half would be considered the pull forward. But again it is really a combination of the two. So we really prefer not to parse it out. Joshua Siber : Sure. My follow up then is in the Southeast or in geographies where weather was more consistent with the norm; can you talk about what the trends look like there? Were the months evenly spread out or did March accelerate? Tony Crudele : When we look at the geographic distribution, the strong as I have mentioned on the call was the Southeast and that was -- that area was a little bit more smooth throughout the three months. But for the most part as I had indicated January strong, February a little bit softer and then obviously some strength in March itself. But in all cases all three months were positive and I wanted to say pretty much throughout all geographic locations throughout the quarter. Operator : We will take our next question from Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities. Jessica Mace : Hi. Congrats on the nice quarter. My first question is about the health of the consumer. On your last call you made some comments about seeing some caution amongst consumers. And I was just wondering on the other side of the first quarter if you have any updates or any changes you've noticed in that behavior? Tony Crudele : Jessica, this is Tony. I'll answer that since I have such handle on the consumer themselves but I'd tell you that really our outlook hasn't changed. We are basic need company and people are coming to us for their everyday needs and that is really the consistency of our business model. As we talked about big ticket relatively consistent and again consistent with chain average for the most part in the quarter. So again we have a resilient model because of the basic needs and supporting that of the rural lifestyle and we did not see any significant changes in the consumer patterns throughout the quarter. Jessica Mace : Okay, thank you. And then my second question is on the transportation cost. I just wondered if you could review some of the moving pieces a little bit where you get a benefit from as a result of the southwest distribution center and then on some of the inbound on freight cost, what the outlook is for those and for the rest of the year? Greg Sandfort : Certainly. When it comes to the transportation cost, the key to the Arizona Distribution Center is that obviously we are reducing the outbound 10 miles to the store and we are very successful there and we saw a reduction in those transportation cost. But obviously the inbound from many of our eastern based vendors, the inbound miles increased substantially as well. So the key to the program go forward is to make sure that we have either additional facilities of the eastern vendor base and they opened up additional facilities out West and/or we bring on western based vendors. So when -- but the key to the distribution center really is as we move forward and then the stores that we open in the West now will not have that de-leveraging impact that we experienced as we had that accelerated growth out West. So as we bring on new stores out West, they will be less impactful to our transportation cost. And that's really the key benefit to the Arizona Distribution Center. Operator : We will take a next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : Yes, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Just looking at the ticket the improvement there, you spoke to the basket getting bigger. What are some of the areas where you are seeing product merchandize resonate with customers to drive this and how sustainable do you think this trend is going forward? Steve Barbarick : Ben, Steve Barbarick here. What I'd tell you is we got a number of different levers to drive sales and one of those is drive aisle. And that's in cap the power panels clip through the center court, Greg referenced chick days earlier in his can remarks and we also had a garden event that took place in the center court. And we are seeing really good movement in both of those events as well as getting behind and working with our vendors on our in cap programs. So that's really would help to drive some of the increase in the basket. In terms of sustainability, this is the focus for us and it's something we are getting better at. And I'd hate to tell you that I wouldn't want to suggest that this is sustainable on every quarter we talk about the gain but I can tell you we are making concerted effort to put in front the customers those impulse buys as they shop our store for needs based product. Ben Bienvenu : Great. And then looking at import sales continues to nicely tick up as a percentage of total sales, what are some of the categories that are driving the majority of the growth? And then when you look out to the future where do you see a lot of opportunities? What gets you excited about continuation of that penetration rate? Steve Barbarick : Over the last few years, we've really put a concerted effort into our exclusive brand program and product development. We've got a number of agents that we worked with overseas and the team and the merchandize team has done a very nice job building our exclusive brands. If you look at some of the new things we've added for example we got in the Travelier line a new lighting set for truck accessories. We've got ground works that came in which is in our garden program. And there is a variety of things that we've been bringing that customers seemed to really respond to. So this is continuous to be a focus for us and I believe that there are still lots of room we have ahead of us. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the spring pull forward a little bit. I mean as you step back, I mean weather overall sounded like it was probably neutral considering how it played out for you on February, as you look at the trend of the quarter. Is that fair? And as you just think about with what you're seeing in April and what you saw in March, it was March more, okay, it was warmer than last year, but in the grand scheme of things, it arrived on a more on-time basis relative to the longer history of how seasonal sets up? Steve Barbarick : When we look at the quarter, net-net we would assess that weather was positive because we had a relatively cold January and then we had the early arrival of spring in March. So as much as February was little bit warmer and sales were little bit softer. Net-net so the quarter we felt very good about the weather trends. In our case, lot has to do with how the weather related to the prior year. And so when we make the comment that one it was a much warmer March overall than in history it was also much warmer than a prior year. So it does relate -- it does impact the timing of the sales. Now when we make assessment as to what the pull forward is, we do our best to look at some of the key category and we look at sort of the slope of the sales line to try to understand if it was accelerated and try to project what that means to quarter but again really for our business it is best that we look at it by the half and we have a lot of business left and we'll probably going to make much better assessment as we move through the quarter and see how the first half comes out. Christopher Horvers : Okay. Fair enough. In last quarter there was a big discussion around Texas and the oil patch and also new store productivity with -- on the Analyst Day with some of the stores at West such as Utah. So can you talk about in terms of Texas stores and oil patch itself? Did the gap widened or did gap relative to control group, or however you want to say it, actually stabilize at the level that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then can you talk about how are you seeing new store productivity in the stores out West? Thanks. Steve Barbarick : Sure. When it comes to the -- we will determine the oil patch store. The first thing is that transaction count remained very firm. But the difference between those stores and our control group was very consistent with what we saw in Q4. So that did not change dramatically. But it is -- we did like the performance of the stores because they were all positive in their performance relative to the control group. And we continue to drive sales through the stores for the foot traffic that we are getting. So generally what we see is that so the ticket maybe down because of some very specific type items that are sold in those areas. But day-to-day basic transactions continue to occur and drive business in those stores. Greg Sandfort : Chris, this is Greg. As far as the western stores and respect to that new store performance particularly Utah we talked about the last call, we are still building awareness in that market. And we have an executive trip that we make every quarter with the teams and we chose this past quarter to make the trip out to the West. We were in Phoenix market, Utah market, some other western market. And I must tell you we feel very strongly that it is an awareness issue and as we are seeing the store ramp, we are feeling very good about our future prospects out there. It is about market awareness. It is about how we positioned. There has been some competition in those markets as we\u2019ve come in to them that it takes a little longer and I think we saw this a few years back when we were first entering the Florida market and the Louisiana market. So we are feeling good about it. I think the mix of our business out there is a little different than we've seen in other markets but we are figuring that out, rebalancing some of the store inventories and now with the southwest DC in position we can react to lot faster, so we are feeling very good actually about the West right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats as well. Tony, real quickly on some of the just financials. Are you still looking at about $8.5 million for the DC for the year? I believe that's what you guided to. And still very front half weighted? Tony Crudele : We had anticipated that would be the year-over-year drag that we would experience. So yes pretty much consistent what we've originally guided. Adam Sindler : Great. And then just as we look at gross margins over the course of the year, could you remind us why again the fourth quarter is going to have such a difficult compare despite sort of the relatively in line gross margin from last year? Tony Crudele : Yes. Again relative to the fourth quarter when we analyze it and we look at all the pluses and minuses are probably about 13 to 15 different impacts on that. And really just matter of looking at those and understanding what will by cycling against and where we see the tougher compares and as much as it is difficult to breakout all those pieces for you. It just turns out that the fourth quarter we believe would be one of the tougher comparisons. Adam Sindler : Okay. Then just lastly, one thing you talk about is trying to keep on finding new products to introduce to drive some of the end caps and things like that. As you've moved more national, are there any thing maybe a local product that you've found that you've been able to bring back and take it more national? Anything from going out to the West, just outside of just opening new stores there, maybe from a merchandising standpoint? Steve Barbarick : Adam, that's a great question. I mean we are constantly in a test and learn mode. And whether it's local, whether it's testing in 25 stores, learning from it and rolling it forward, it's a constant pipeline of product that runs through the system and then gets expanded. We do all, a monthly review of all those tests that we've got going on. I'll use it one example a couple of years ago we tested kayaks in 50 stores and sold -- they sold pretty well, they exceeded sale through rate then we expanded it to more stores and this year all stores have kayaks and we are continue to see good momentum there. So I can't give you any one specific guidance but I could tell you that pipeline is pretty full and we are constantly reviewing the opportunity for further expansion of new merchandize. Adam Sindler : Great. And then lastly on that anything on the ammo test? Is that in the stores yet, or when will that hit? Steve Barbarick : Well, actually, interesting you should ask, couple of weeks ago I guess maybe it was week or two ago we did roll forward with about 25 stores. Again it's still in the very early stages. Stores are still setting their merchandize and I suspect that on the next call we will be able to give you better and update. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, Tony, on the $80 million should we expect that's going to all come out of the second quarter so if we just look at it last year it is about 100 basis points to the comp. So should we model whatever our comp estimate was before this quarter that we should essentially just take that down by a 100 basis points? Tony Crudele : Michael, good question. When we look at it there is that potential, we really believe it's just too early to tell what the impact would be again it's just an estimate. If you use that $80 million and you took it out of the quarter it would represent about a 1% change in the comp sales. But again it is just our best estimate at the time and there are a lot of sales that we had so it is too difficult to just make the assessment that all of it would come out of April. Michael Lasser : And can you make any changes to your cost structure as such or it is what it is we just go with it? Tony Crudele : Obviously, we'll look at the variable expenses and which main driver would be your payroll. So we will align our payroll with what we see the sales trends are today April as we move into May. And some of that is really more trending, more current trending as we look at the sales in a particular period. But other than that the expense structure for the most part would be intact. Michael Lasser : And then Greg I just want to clarify your comments. When you talk about new store productivity you reference the western portion in United States, we've seen previously that if there were any issue with new store productivity and the lack of brand awareness, it was mostly around those stores in Utah. So is there something to have changed you viewpoint, or is it mostly semantic? Greg Sandfort : No. This new -- overall an aggregate to new stores are performing very well and they are performing at or above pro forma forecast. But in -- not just I won't just say Utah Utah, I just say in a few places in the West, we've seen little slower ramp but that's now beyond us and we are now starting to see the stores performed to a level that is acceptable to us and it kind of fits in with what we expected initially. So it's not just Utah although it was a little bit slower start initially. We are learning. The West is a new market for us. We were in California and I think before we start expansion to the West I think the furthest we were, was probably Colorado. There is lot of room in between that particular state. But we are feeling very solid now that we have -- we understand those markets better. We now have been out there a little over year of most of store base. And I think we are -- there are no concerns for us going forward with the West. Tony Crudele : And I would add Michael that when we do our calculation new store productivity, we did see an increase this quarter over Q4 last year. Michael Lasser : It was better than it was last year. So as we talked about it is in the high 60s versus this quarter 70% but that still little bit lower than they had been historically. So should we assume that as you add more stores in the West and because you've already got a base there your brand awareness is better and new store productivity should improve over time? Especially because I think you said in the past that new -- that the stores out West are actually little bit more productive once they reach total maturity. Greg Sandfort : Yes. As we continue to grow out there in brand awareness. I think that pieces would be that it would take less time for us to gain market share as the brand becomes more aware and accepted out West. Operator : We will take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I was curious on some of the bigger ticket trends. It sounds like weather was both the positive and negative. I guess just kind of looking forward here with some of the spring some are merchandize with lawn mowers. How do you feel about that general demand and some of the category dynamics performing here for the next few quarters? Steve Barbarick : The big ticket itself as Tony mentioned we did see some benefit in Q1 in terms of plus numbers mainly driven by riders and as well as trailers, some of that was a bit pull forward. We feel like we've got the right assortments out there. We've gone through, we've measured right assortment, and we review our assortments. We are a need based retailer, so if there is demand I would tell you I feel pretty good about it. Tony said it's still early in the game here in Q2. And right now it's hard to assess but I'd tell you we've got the right product out in our stores. Peter Keith : Okay. Thanks for that Steve. My follow up would be just on the gross margin expansion which is obviously been observed is very good. Should we think about the margin expansion that you saw as sort of best of the year, given what sounded like there was some one-time vendor support for the DC and then maybe some benefits around that extended seasonal set? Steve Barbarick : Okay. I'll go ahead start this one. This is Steve again. The one thing about gross margin specifically is that we got a plan. And it all starts there. We talked earlier about exclusive brands, product development, some of the import goods we got come in. We also -- our systems are much more science than art based price optimization, clearance price optimization and so in Q1 there was a shift. Tony mentioned earlier that we did have some clearance coming out of Q4. But we were able to beat that with some regular price as well as some vendor support dollars. So what I'd tell is as I feel good that we've got a plan and the teams executing to it. Tony, you have anything to add. Tony Crudele : Yes. Peter, I highlighted the vendor support relative to the distribution center because that is more of one time issue. But when we look at the margin we have a lot of real positive that occurred. And obviously Steve touched on but that the price management the import the exclusive brand was all very favorable this quarter. The fuel was positive, the way we manage promotion was much more favorable than the prior year. The way we cleared the merchandize. So net-net as much as we -- I played that one item, I would agree with the original perception that it was a very strong margin quarter for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I really want to talk about comps first. Tony, if we adjust out the $18 million from the 1Q results, two-year stack basis, you're still producing comps that are north of 9%. If we were to trend that out for the rest of year, you'd be above your guidance range for the year. Is there a reason why on that adjusted basis we should assume that two-year stack comps should decelerate through the year? Tony Crudele : When we look at that, Steve and I are looking at each other and I am not sure if it is a matter of how we do our forecasting and maybe some of the conservative nature in the numbers. But we will take a look at the seasons; we will take a look at how we developed our product plan throughout the year. We'll look at the year-over-year and in some cases we may actually go three years deep to look at some of the comparison. So our modeling is built from the bottom up and so we think that as much as the time it maybe a little conservative. We think that as we started the year and we continue through the years, we think that it is very reasonable guidance. Steve Barbarick : Seth, the only thing I would add is that Q1 comparison was pretty challenging and I think we feel really good about where we came in. Tony did mention there were some pull forward. Q2 is not going to be an easy quarter either. We had a good solid comp last year and with some favorable weather so it's hard to look out and be able to forecast but I think we've got a pretty good plan in place. Seth Basham : Got you. Fair enough. And then secondly, I was hoping you could touch a little bit more on your new store plans, where you opened geographically in the first quarter, any differences in timing year-over-year, and then where you're trimming back? I think you took your guidance down by up to 5 stores for the year. Steve Barbarick : The guidance for the full year was consistent with our original guidance. Again we expect to open about 50% of the stores in the first half of the year. And 50% obviously in the back half of the year. The only difference that we see this year is that we are little bit less stores in the West. We had a very focused push over the last two years to get the number of stores, create a large base in the southwest so that we could open the distribution centers and get some of the economic benefit from that. So as we look out at this year we see few less stores in the West. We were running about 35% to 40%, we expect to be a little bit more and say the 25% range when it comes to the western stores. And additionally, we anticipate opening a few more second use real estate versus built to suit locations. And that would mean some additional capital probably maybe the $5 million to $10 million range. But those are the only two differences that we see as we move through the new store opening plan. Seth Basham : Got it. And one last follow-up if I may. Greg, you mentioned that you've learned a lot in the West and you're approaching your openings out there differently. Can you provide any color about what you're doing differently? That would be helpful. Greg Sandfort : I make it short. I think we have to keep our foot down on the pedal when it comes to marketing to make sure that we stay with these stores little longer. There are couples of things that are unique in some of these markets from merch standpoint that we've learned and we've addressed that now. And I think we become very good listeners to our teams out there. And what we are doing from a local market presence and that could be interacting with local rodeos with different 4H and FFA groups so there is a heightened what I would call awareness out there who we are now versus our initial approach. And these little different and maybe what we've done in some of the markets where we've an existing presence. It is not overbearing but those learnings we are applying. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If you could just size the impact of freight or transport to gross margin rate. I know you've done that in the past. I'm curious there, if you can help with that? Steve Barbarick : Yes. I can give you a general idea. I try not to break all the components down into basis points because there are so many factors that are attributed to the freight line and gross margin. So the once that I identified has having an impact or somewhat minimal impact, they were generally in the same range and generally would be less than 10 basis points of impact to the gross margin line. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay. I guess as I think about it, it sounds like the inbound may be getting a little bit worse than the color that we got last quarter. Do you think that's a fair read? And separately, do you think you can start to leverage that line at some point this year, even if oil prices start to move in the other direction? Steve Barbarick : When we look out we would expect to see a similar impact in Q2 and we would expect that to start to moderate as we move through the year and start to get the benefits of the distribution center and moving some of our vendors to western ship points. So we expected to start to moderate as we move through the year but net-net for the year we expected to be just slight drag on margin. Stephen Tanal : Got it. That's helpful. And just lastly if you could just tell us on the seasonal reset it sounds like maybe there is another change or near positive benefit in maybe 3Q or 4Q. What do you think that timing looks like if you don't mind? Steve Barbarick : Yes. I am not specifically sure. I said can you repeat the question. Stephen Tanal : Yes. Going from three to five seasonal resets, is there another change upcoming in this year, and which quarter does that affect? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Earlier I think I have mentioned that in Q1 we were able to do that. We went from three waves in two weeks to five waves in eight. Next in the fall we are going to keep a very consistent program that what we've done traditionally. I think we are much more accurate then. So there won't be a change in the fall. Operator : We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Thanks. Greg wanted to follow-up on your comments about the benefits from Revionics. Are you continuing to get benefits from the initial markup module or are most of the current benefits coming from markdown management? Greg Sandfort : Dan, we are in two modules right now. Regular price and clearance. So we kind of cover both sides. We haven't turned on promotional yet. And it is not all about mark up. It is actually a combination of can we find margin or can we find can we drive sales. And so what you turn price optimization on it is an ever moving and living, increasing process and when we are moving to different markets we are going to try different things, test different price elasticity. So you are correct. You will see some improvement on mark down or clearance for that side we are seeing some improvements in our regular price pricing and how we can stay competitive in market. And it's really we needed a system because of all the different pricing strategies we got throughout the country. We are in 49 states. We are not a single regular price on everything and every state being the same. So that is another reason why we put the system in. Dan Wewer : When you think about the promotional pricing module that's available, are you committed to making that investment? And how will the pay back on that compare to the first two applications? Greg Sandfort : At this point in time we have not made a decision that we would move forward with a promotional pricing module. We are still working to the first two. If we do make that decision then you can bet that we are going to see some type of return on investment or we wouldn't do it. Dan Wewer : And then Tony, just to follow up once more on the sales pull forward comment. Are you seeing anything in the results in April that would confirm that you moved some revenues from April into March? Tony Crudele : There could be some potential. And again that goes into our calculation and estimate of the $80 million. Obviously, again a little bit difficult assessment because as we moved into April the weather was little cooler. So there was an impact there. So we are constantly assessing as we move through the quarter but obviously as this warm weather is moved in we are really optimistic about the May and June and timeframe and our spring assortment. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon, everyone. Nice quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how some of the marked down discipline you took in the fourth quarter set you up for the first quarter and how you make sure inventory weren't too low going into the first quarter? Especially the seasonal merchandize. Steve Barbarick : Yes. Chuck, this is Steve Barbarick. There are two types of seasonal merchandize. There is product that we bought for Christmas is not necessarily cold product related. And we sold through that really well. It was the more seasonal clearance that we ended up carrying over and I believe at that the last call we talked about the percentage that we carried over. A lot of retailers would have probably taken marked down a lot quicker and panic to some degree. But a lot of the product that we have our whole good that are pretty much standby is year-to-year. And we took a very disciplined approach. We didn't panic in Q4; we took methodical mark down where we could. We do have a clearance price optimization that looks specifically at clearance by individual location so we can cluster those types of products. When we got into the first quarter we had the benefit of that winter. Colder weather hit us from January. And we had enough of merchandize up north knowing that we went for these five waves of allocation. And it really paid off for us. Now we still are carrying some of that inventory over. I don't want to say that we sold completely through but it's good inventory that we can bring out for next year and the carry over is minimal compared to the total inventory investment that we have out there today. So the team did a really nice job. I think it was a discipline approach. We use both art and science based on some of what we are looking at and we came out of it really well. Tony Crudele : And regarding the five ways from my perspective in northeast Ohio, I think some of that like it looks like the chick programs come in later here this year than last. That would be maybe part of it. I'd tell you where you would see the biggest and most significant impact is really more in the seasonal, some of the power equipment and things like that. So where we would have set stores probably in new area in early February the stores would have been set a little bit later up north towards the end of February. And the southern stores really benefited because they actually got product two weeks earlier than what they traditionally would have gotten products. So as Greg said earlier we were able to capitalize on an earlier spring in the south and keep some of that quarter related merchandize out on the floor through really the month of February and start setting spring at that point. Operator : We will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. How are you? Great. A bit of strategic question. I know it is kind of talked around and a lot of weather-related questions, but when you wind up getting the kind of weather impact that you did in the first quarter, does that change how you plan your merchandising or inventory sets for 2Q? Steve Barbarick : Again, this is Steve Barbarick. We set for a season. We don't set necessarily for a quarter. And our quarters are while they are fiscal they are kind of calendar so that March, April timeframe you never know. There is always a bit of shift. So we look at the season and we manage to season. We don't necessarily manage our inventories to quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up for Tony. Something people have asked about previously, and just wondering if you had any more recent thoughts on it, is the potential ability to improve payables to inventory ratio and potentially take some working capital out of your operation. You had inventory up by $100 million, payables essentially flat. Just wondering what's the right way to think about the payable to inventory ratio going forward, and again, what is the opportunity set there? Tony Crudele : Yes. Scot, I absolutely agree with you and I think you should continue to call Steve Barbarick on that. But we do have some plans in place but I would agree whole heartily it is something that we need to have more discipline around and be more aggressive relative to that because it clearly is sort of the one whole back when it comes to-- there are returns on invested capital. Operator : We will take a next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Hi, guys. Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the loyalty program. That is one something I don't think we talked about today, just latest trends. I know at the Analyst Day, you said it was about 140 stores in the test mode, and just any more data or color you could share would be helpful. Steve Barbarick : Happy to do it Joe. We are in -- as you mentioned 140 stores, we got about six months now of earning and what I would tell you is that the opting rate by our consumers have actually exceeded original expectations. We knew that we had fairly loyal customer and it wasn't really till we have the program out there that we realize that they were very interested and wanting to hear from us and being part of a program. In the stores that we've had in  We've seen nice attribution increases and understanding who are our customer is and getting a deeper knowledge. Now just give you a couple of examples. In the stores where we got the Neighbors Club program from a transaction standpoint we went from really about mid 30s to mid 50s, so we've seen nice increase in transaction attribution and in sales attribution that numbers go up from the little 50s to the mid 60s. We are using that data now because the goal of this was to collect the information and then start personalizing communication after them using email. And we've been doing just that. We've got now record of the response rates from our customers. And the communication back and forth regarding either content or special offers or trying to get them into the shop across the store. So we are very enthusiastic about the program and at this point we are looking forward next step. We don't yet; we are not prepared to make a comment as to where we are going roll it or how many stores will get it. But we are optimistic that this is something that's going to add value. Joe Feldman : That's great. Good, thanks for the update on that. And then so one another quick question. Any also an update on some of the pet resets that you have done in terms of maybe lift and if there is any kind of way you can see what's been driving, how much that's driven comp or--? Steve Barbarick : Well, I won't get into the specifics Joe but I would tell you Greg mentioned it earlier. Our customer's index is very high when it comes to animal ownership. And that includes dogs and cats as well. And we go through a pretty rigorous category management review of the pet aisle supplies, treat as well as pet food every year and in some cases twice a year. We are seeing growth. We look at three different segments. We look at the grocery segment, we look at the science segment and we look at the premium, super premium segments. And I would tell you we are seeing growth in all three of those segments. We put a lot of our real estate as well as some of our marketing into the super premium side of the business in our investments. And we think we are getting a very nice pay off. Customers are responding favorably and I think that's one of the things that maybe growing our transaction count. We talk a lot about CUE and being needs based and this would be example of that. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Sandfort, at this point I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Sandfort : Thank you, operator. As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to be excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Tractor Supply. We are pleased with the first quarter results and the year is off to a good solid start. But there is still a lot of business ahead as Tony mentioned. We will continue to invest in our infrastructure, our system improvements and our omni channel business as we target mid-teens EPS growth. Thank you for your support of our company. We look forward to speaking to you again in July regarding our second quarter performance. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

I am now pleased to introduce Greg Sandfort, Tractor Supply Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Greg, please go ahead. Greg Sandfort : Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer. As you are all aware from our pre-release on June 29, we had a challenging second quarter, not the typical Tractor Supply performance. And clearly, the weather was not favorable. The bottom line is our business was heavily influenced by weather in Q2. We have worked very hard to be the most dependable supplier of products to the rural lifestyle customer. And the fact remains that some of those products, being seasonal in nature, can be impacted by weather. Weather has always been a factor in our business and we know it\u2019s our job to manage around those external factors. However, we generally have not experienced the extreme conditions in variability in the weather from region to region like we saw in this second quarter. Hot and dry in the West, cold and wet in the East and Midwest and severe flooding and damage in the South Central. Just about every region experienced some form of weather variance and the conditions were very different from region to region. When the weather began to normalize in June, so did our business, but the turn was not enough to offset the weakness in April and May and not enough for us to anticipate that a significant shift in seasonal sales will occur coming into the third quarter. As a result, we have become a bit more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, although last year\u2019s sales comparisons are more favorable in the second half. During the quarter, very strong demand for our core animal and pet offerings continued and we believe we are gaining share in these areas. We also saw continued momentum with events that directly support the sustainable lifestyle. Chick Days and our garden event both experienced strong year-over-year growth. We saw healthy demand for outdoor furniture, pest and rodent control products, barbecue grills, but unfavorable weather and a difficult year-over-year sales comparison challenged our ability to drive sales providing lawnmowers, lawn and garden products and utility vehicles. We did see increased demand in departments where we continued to innovate and introduce newness such as truck lighting and accessories, trailers and outdoor water recreation. Our inventory and planning teams did an excellent job reacting to the softer sales trends in the quarter and through a balanced approach managed the sales margin and inventory investment in relationship to customer demand. Tractor Supply will continue to invest in our business to drive sales, shorten our supply chain timeline and increase our overall productivity and profitability as a company. In addition to implementing an improved allocation system, we are continuing our test and learn process on the merchandise side, expanding our new customer loyalty program pilot, growing our store mobile point-of-sale test and conducting a comprehensive DC network analysis. And we are pleased with the progress we are making on all of these initiatives. Just this month, we expanded the test of our Neighbors Club customer loyalty program to the California market and now have over 190 stores participating. While still early in the process, the initial enrollment rates continue to be ahead of our expectations. We are finding that our Neighbors Club members are highly engaged to a tractor and we are experiencing higher open and click-through rates on our targeted e-mails and communications to them. We have now completed the implementation of our new allocation system. The new system is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our allocation process and is scalable to support our long-term store growth targets. We continue to expand the test of mobile POS devices into our stores. And as the functionality has improved, the adaptation from our team members and customers have also increased. This capability will enable us and our team members to sell and assist customers with products from any point in or outside our stores. And lastly, we are continuing the analysis of our DC network and systems, which we believe will be critical in supporting our growth to 2,500 stores and evolving our supply chain strategy and capability for the longer term. Overall, we believe these and other investments have made our business more nimble and less susceptible to external factors. But recent results remind us that extreme weather conditions from region to region can impact our business in the short-term and this is not likely to change. We continue to manage the business with the future in mind and believe continuous improvement in our product and service offerings in addition to improving systems and efficiencies will keep Tractor Supply well positioned for growth. Looking forward into the second half of the year, we are a bit more cautious. Despite the more normalized trends in June, we do not believe that we will see much of an extended spring selling season to recoup the sales loss in the second quarter. We revised our full year guidance in our June 29 business update press release and are reiterating that guidance today. Tony will take you through this in greater detail in a moment. From a product and inventory perspective, we believe we are in a solid position to meet the needs of our customers as we transition the business from summer to fall. And before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply team for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our overall business. I also want to congratulate Tony on his planned retirement and Kurt Barton on his planned promotion to CFO. As we announced in today\u2019s earnings press release, Tony has notified the company that he plans to retire during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Kurt Barton, the company\u2019s Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will succeed Tony as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Kurt has been with Tractor Supply for 17 years and is a talented financial leader with a proven track record of creating value. We all have the utmost confidence in his ability to continue leading the financial team forward. To ensure a smooth transition of duties, Kurt and Tony will work together over the next 7 months, with Kurt increasing his interface with the investment community through investor meetings and calls in the back half of the year. I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2016. Tony Crudele : Thanks, Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 0.5% in the second quarter compared to a very strong increase of 5.6% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Comp store sales were challenged throughout the quarter, with April and May impacted primarily from unfavorable weather patterns and tough comparisons from prior year. Beginning with Memorial Day weekend and warmer weather, seasonal sales trends normalized and comp store sales were in line with our expectations in the month of June. Sales were the weakest in the Northern regions of the country, where unseasonably cool temperatures reduced demand for many spring items. The Southern regions, which were less impacted by the cooler weather, performed more consistently with our expectations and had positive comps except for the Texas region. In addition to the impact of the oil patch economy, certain areas of Texas were negatively impacted by heavy rains and flooding, which limited some of the spring season activities. Comp transaction count increased for the 33rd consecutive quarter, gaining 1.5% on top of a 4.2% increase last year as C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food continued to post high single-digit comps. Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 130 basis point increase. Big ticket drove last year\u2019s increase and was the principal driver of this year\u2019s average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 8.5% as big ticket items such as riding lawn mowers and utility vehicles were challenged due to strong comparisons to last year and this year\u2019s unfavorable selling conditions. Deflation also had a slight impact on average ticket and contributed approximately 25 basis points to the decrease. Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 23 basis points to 35% compared to a 50 basis point improvement in last year\u2019s second quarter. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. Although margin benefited from soft sales of some of the key big ticket items such as riding lawn mowers, this benefit was more than offset by the soft sales in other high margin departments and the strong sales of lower margin C.U.E. items. With respect to margin rate, while promotion cadence was relatively consistent with last year with the exception of a friends and neighbors event, we were slightly sharper on price to drive sales. Freight was unfavorable as an increase in inbound transportation costs more than offset the benefits from lower diesel prices and a reduction in the outbound stem miles. We estimate deflation had a slight favorable impact on gross margin. For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales de-levered by 15 basis points to 21.6% of sales compared to 21.4% of sales in the prior year\u2019s quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors. The deleverage was primarily due to the lower comparable sales results as SG&A expense grew only 5.2% from the prior year. Excluding incentive compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 6.7%, which is below the SG&A growth rate over the past several quarters. We experienced strong cost control in personnel, including store level, distribution center and store support payroll as well as medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we began to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona distribution center that was not open at this time last year. We estimate the deleverage from this center\u2019s operation to be approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year due to additional federal and the state tax credits. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2 this year we had cash balance of $151.1 million and $196.2 million in outstanding debt, principally comprised of the term loan compared to a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt last year. During the second quarter, we had limited purchases under our stock repurchase program. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.2% compared to 4.1% increase in last year\u2019s second quarter and inventory turns decreased compared to last year. We had strong inventory management in the quarter considering the soft sales environment. The transition between second and third quarters generally does not have significant markdown exposure. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter and we expect a normal markdown cadence exiting the season. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $64.3 million compared to $48.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed 1 Del\u2019s store in the second quarter compared to 17 new stores and one closed store in the second quarter of 2015. The CapEx increase relates to our new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project. Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results for the first half of the year, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2016 in our June 29 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. We expect full year sales to range from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% and net income to range from $451 million to $456 million with earnings per diluted share to be $3.35 to $3.40. Assumed in this guidance is an EBIT margin improvement of about 10 basis points to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.8% and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $134.5 million to $134.8 million. In our June 29 business update, we stated that although June sales were more normalized, we did not expect a shift of spring sales into the third quarter. While it is still early in the third quarter, the trends through the first few weeks of July would appear to support this expectation. From a comparison standpoint in the third quarter, we face our toughest year-over-year comparison in July and our easiest comparison is in September. As a reminder, we had a record mild winter last year and therefore, we believe that any upside in our forecast will be in the fourth quarter. We also have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. The additional sales week will provide incremental expense leverage in the fourth quarter and we estimate that the additional week will provide $0.03 to $0.04 increase to EPS, which is contained in our guidance. In our original full year guidance, we have forecasted $0.01 negative EPS impact from the closing of several Del\u2019s stores in the fourth quarter as part of our transition to Tractor Supply stores in Washington State. We have now made the decision to close those stores closer to their lease expiration, with most of them expiring in 2017. We are pleased with the performance to-date of the Tractor Supply stores that we have opened in the former Del\u2019s markets. We continue to expect limited deflation in the back half of the year in the 15 basis point to 20 basis point range. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect improvement of EBIT margin driven principally by improved gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters and expense leverage from the 53rd week. While transportation expenses will continue to be a headwind as we cycle the decline in diesel prices, we expect our gross margin initiatives to continue to drive improvement. With respect to SG&A, we were very pleased with our expense management in Q2. We will continue to drive cost saving programs in the back half and we will react accordingly to sales trends, but we would expect year-over-year increase in SG&A to track closer to the overall growth in sales. We expect to maintain the appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the back half and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona distribution center until we cycle its opening in late December. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Hey guys. Greg Sandfort : Hello Steven. Steven Forbes : As it relates to the top line performance over the past few quarters across the different regions and you briefly touched on it, but is there anything you are learning from the region with the loyalty card \u2013 with the loyalty program as it relates to weather and just general consumer behaviors during these unique weather events, what I am trying to get at, is there any \u2013 is there less variability right in the region where you have those \u2013 where you have the loyalty program in consumer trends and behavior because your ability to communicate with the consumer \u2013 or is the region \u2013 is it really not that different? Greg Sandfort : Steven this is Greg. It\u2019s really early for us to say that we have seen anything significant because of it, but what I can tell you is that the reason we took \u2013 the program expanded to California is it \u2013 we really liked what we are seeing in Michigan with the engagement and how the customers are responding to it very openly. So, we want to move it to California to take it another step. And I think 6 months from now we will probably have a better idea to give you some ideas of how it is impacting. We don\u2019t have enough data yet to say that we can use that to really reach back to customers and either poll them for information about how they are feeling or what they are buying or not buying. So, it\u2019s now just gathering the data and getting them into the database, to be honest. Steven Forbes : And then as a follow-up, maybe as it relates to the merchandising since we are really 2 days away, I believe from the next open buying day. Can you just briefly talk about what departments in your mind right as of today represent the greatest revenue margin opportunity, especially from a productivity standpoint in the box? I mean, I know from our pricing in our reports and from our own visits, paddles seems to stick out just given the space allocation. But heading into an event like the open buying day on Friday and so forth, is there \u2013 are there anything that you guys can talk about that you are looking forward to or you see a lot of opportunity from a merchandising side? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Steve. This is Steve again. Hey, what I would tell you is that it\u2019s kind of two-pronged here. The advantage of the open buying day is this. We are going to get an opportunity to see 300, 400 folks come through and talk to our teams, all of which are doing business with Tractor Supply today and really getting a better understanding of what\u2019s going on in the marketplace, because most of these folks, either seller or competitors or they are somewhere else out there that we can get a better read on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. Everyone who signs up, we will give some time, too. And so we don\u2019t really narrow it down into any one given category. In terms of what we are looking at in the box itself to move our business forward, we have talked a lot about the C.U.E. business. And you will see a number of resets that are going to take place in the back half of this year that will support that, whether it would be what we are doing in feed with the launch of our Do More equine program or what we are going to see in terms of Blue Seal, which will expand out to another couple of hundred stores in the Northeast and down the corridor. So, there is a lot of things that are happening within the box right now, not just in terms of resets, but also events such as Deer Feeding that we have got out there right now that\u2019s doing particularly well or the Stock Your Shop tool event. And in that then itself, we are going to have about 60% new products that we didn\u2019t have a year ago to really give our customers a treasure hunt experience. So, I could go on and on about all the things that we are working on, but I would say across the board, we have got a lot of things cooking. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. And Tony, best of luck in your retirement. Certainly, you made it abundantly clear the impact of weather on the business, particularly in that first two periods of the quarter. I guess, can you maybe shed a little bit more color then why, if you feel so strongly it is weather-related, you are incrementally more cautious for the second half? And then I do have a follow-up. Greg Sandfort : Alan, this is Greg. Couple of things to note. The second quarter was difficult and there was just incredibly, let\u2019s say, challenging weather in some of the regions of the country, where we have typically been able to weather those storms in the past, but I will give you an example in Texas, very, very difficult, massive flooding, lot of destruction. That will take time for that market to come back. It\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t snapback tomorrow. So, our feeling was, let\u2019s be a little more conservative as we go in the second half. We know it\u2019s going to take some time for a large market like that where we have 170 plus stores to recover. And we \u2013 and as we talked amongst ourselves, our feeling was we are always kind of a conservative group here. We would rather be more conservative and give ourselves an opportunity to exceed that than to say, well, we think \u2013 we can\u2019t forecast the future. We could only kind of deal with the past and try to look at that and understand what could be in front of us. So, that\u2019s really \u2013 we are just \u2013 we are being a little more conservative given the fact that we had such a difficult second quarter with the weather variations. Alan Rifkin : Okay. And as a follow-up, so if we were to dissect your business in another way, namely, classes of stores added in more recent years, let\u2019s call it, 2013, \u201814, \u201815, are the stores that were added in those classes possibly more susceptible to the weather than prior classes? Tony Crudele : Well, Alan, this is Tony. We generally \u2013 other than in sort of \u201814 and \u201815, where we were trying to build our base out in the Southwest to create the volume for our Arizona distribution center, we generally are very geographically dispersed. So, I don\u2019t think there was a particular emphasis. And in this case, the Southwest has performed very well for us and so there is less of a concern. Obviously, if you ran into a significant drought situation in a particular area of the country, that may have an impact, but generally because of the geographic disbursement of the stores, we tend to be somewhat insulated from one \u2013 some particular area of the country having some weather event. Alan Rifkin : Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey, guys. Thanks and congrats Tony. Best of luck. First question, just to clarify, on the Del closings, I think you have 13 of those stores left. Are you going to \u2013 are you closing any of the balance of the year or are they all going to be in \u201817? Just can you help us with that? Steve Barbarick : Sure. Right now, it looks like there is a few that are scheduled for the back half, so it\u2019s more like just two or three. And that will leave about, I want to say 10 to 12 for next year and they will be spread throughout the year and a lot of them again in the back half. But when we looked at it and we saw that some of the stores actually are performing well, we haven\u2019t had a match necessarily of a Tractor Supply store coming into that marketplace, we just felt it would be more prudent to leave them opened until they come closer to their lease termination date. Peter Benedict : Okay. You had mentioned that there was a $0.01 hit to earnings that was embedded in your guidance, I think you said at the beginning of the year, but that\u2019s not in there now. Is it \u2013 did I hear you correctly? Tony Crudele : Correct. And so that would be the one area where we had $0.01 pickup in the back half of the year relative to our original forecast and that\u2019s probably part of the conservativism in the back half that we did not pick up that $0.01 in our forecast. Peter Benedict : Right, got it. Understood. And then the next question is just around the DC analysis, Greg that you are talking about. When can we expect kind of more color on maybe some developments that would come from that? I am also thinking about an update around the mixing centers, what your plans are from that perspective? Greg Sandfort : Okay, Peter. First of all, we have been in this process of analysis working with Avista for 6 months, I think, Steve? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Greg Sandfort : Close to that. And we now have their results and their suggestions and we are now going through that saying, okay, what looks plausible and what would the timing really be and how do we move forward? If you remember correctly, we did a similar project about 6 years ago. And that helped us understand the next wave of growth for the company and we got a little ahead of the curve on building buildings and systems, infrastructure and so on. This is the next step again to take us forward. So, you will know more about this. We will speak more to this on the next call, because we just got the results and we are still digesting it. Peter Benedict : Okay, great. Thanks, Greg. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. And Tony, congrats. Twofold questions here. First, just on the sales, so it sounds like the conservative view is somewhat based on what you have seen early in the third quarter. The weather did improve a bit in June and then into July. So, I am just wondering, is there something else happening here where maybe there is some timing dynamic where consumers just end up delaying certain big ticket purchases that they may have missed out on earlier in the season? Is that part of what\u2019s happening here early in the third quarter? Tony Crudele : Yes, Seth. This is Tony. Based on our prepared remarks, the message that we are trying to send is that as we move through the quarter, we are hopeful that with sort of the softness in April and May that we would see a little bit stronger bounce back in June. We did not see that. So, as part of our update on \u2013 in our June 29 business update, we had anticipated that we would not see significant spring sales falling in the July time period. So \u2013 and the last three weeks has verified that expectation. So, we expect it will be limited as we move through the rest of the quarter. And obviously, our easiest compare is in the September timeframe and a lot of that can be driven by cooler weather as people start to ramp up for the winter season. And right now, we expect that it will be cooler in September than last year, but still will be warmer than normal. So obviously, it\u2019s just too early to have an indication as to the third quarter. Seth Sigman : Okay, got it. And then I just want to follow-up on Peter\u2019s question about the network analysis that you are doing, is there a scenario here where you need to significantly increase your spending or do you feel like the earnings growth algorithm that you have laid out previously should account for any potential investments that you need to make? Greg Sandfort : Seth, this is Greg. That analysis \u2013 that\u2019s the part of the analysis we are working through right now as far as what looks plausible. When you \u2013 anytime you do all these analyses, they do every \u2013 it\u2019s ran on a model of the perfect scenario, correct. Nothing is a perfect scenario. And we have some buildings in places that honestly, if we want to look \u2013 went back 10 years ago, we may not have put them in this city, maybe we put it in a city 200 miles to the East, North or the West. So that\u2019s what we are sorting through right now. We do believe that the cost of this as we go forward will be part of our capital plan that we have had and we continue to invest through in this \u2013 the next leg of the growth. So yes, we believe it will be part of that plan. And again, we will share more of this with you. And when we get to the third quarter call, we will have all this sorted through at that time. Seth Sigman : Okay, prefect. Best of luck in the back half. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question and congrats Tony. Tony Crudele : Thank you. Michael Lasser : Greg, there have been points in the past where Tractor Supply has been burdened by the weather, but it was able to power through it either because store base is maturing and driving growth or because it still had a plethora of merchandising activities and new products introduced, is there a case where maybe just given the company\u2019s size or stage of development, it\u2019s harder now to overcome external factors like the weather? Greg Sandfort : No, Michael. I would tell you that we have looked at this and looked at this and no that it would not be the case. There is plenty of newness, plenty of things that we are bringing to the customer. But we have all looked back and did some studying of the last several years of weather trends and things. And it\u2019s just become a little bit more I will call it, unpredictable, meaning that it\u2019s moving the sales around a little bit more than we thought. And so we are reacting to that fairly well, keeping our inventories in control and moving our assortments to the product categories of the customers willing to buy and want to buy. But no I don\u2019t think the size has anything really to do with it. We are still as nimble as we were. We saw plenty of newness. So I think this is us learning something new about how we need to react as these \u2013 I think what we are going to see is more and more of this type of weather patterning and it\u2019s a new learning to be very honest. Michael Lasser : Maybe that being said, is there anything you could have done differently to help drive a better comp during the quarter? Greg Sandfort : I don\u2019t think so, because when you look at the weather patterns in the parts of the country that it affected and how it affected them, we managed the inventories extremely well by region. So I think we did that part extremely well. And to say that there was other opportunities that we may have missed on boy, we looked at it very thoroughly, Steve and the team spent hours and we took advantage of every opportunity that was there. The customer demand just didn\u2019t develop in second quarter. That\u2019s the answer. Michael Lasser : And then on the new store productivity, which also has been trending a bit below average, was that metric impacted by the weather or is that still a lingering effect of some of the lack of brand awareness on the West Coast? Tony Crudele : Michael, this is Tony. We actually are pleased with where we are with the new store productivity. It plateaued pretty much over the last three quarters and the stores out West are performing better. I think that as we cycle through, you will see that the newer stores that we have opened this year are again exceeding pro forma. And we should be able to maintain that new store productivity if not increase it. Michael Lasser : Got it. Thanks again. Operator : And we will go next to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. You mentioned that you were a bit more sharper on price in adding friends and neighbor event, was that mainly in response to the spring seasonal business and as you have transitioned away from that time of year for that business, are you back to a comparable I guess promotional and pricing posture on a year-over-year basis? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Chris, so this is Steve Barbarick. And one of the things that we have talked a lot about, Tractor Supply being a fairly nimble company and we are able to react pretty quickly to the needs of our consumer. And what we saw in the Q2 in the softness in a lot of the seasonal businesses, we felt like we needed to react with something. So we did put a promotional piece out there as Tony referred to. As we look forward, we are going to continue to use all the arrows in our quiver to best support the business. And whether that be using inventory to help move our business forward, it could be looking at additional promotional pieces and it could be a variety of things. Maybe it\u2019s getting more targeted around some of the C.U.E. businesses. Another thing that we are doing is local presentation. So right now, where it\u2019s hot and dry out West, we have got our store teams out there, putting together water movement and fans and things that we are doing down in Texas. So we are constantly moving the business around based on the needs of the consumer. I am not suggesting that we are going to steer one way any \u2013 too far any one way because we use a balanced approach and we have got plenty of initiatives that move us forward. But I also don\u2019t want to rule anything out either. Christopher Horvers : Okay, understood. Well, I guess to clarify that I mean that response is going to make people think that you are being \u2013 continue to be more promotional and it\u2019s a reaction to current demand trends, so is that the message that we are expected to understand? Steve Barbarick : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that whatsoever. I mean we have run our business the same way we have since I have been here and that\u2019s been for the last 18 years. And I wouldn\u2019t want anybody to think that we are going to steer one way any too far, one way left or one way right. We try to present value to our customers day-in, day-out. And that\u2019s what they come in for. So again, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then as you think about the oil patch and the performance of the stores, you had baked in lapping that, I think it fell off \u2013 those stores really fell off at the end of the third quarter, as you looked over the first half of this year, how was your outlook for those \u2013 the performance of those stores as we start to lap the fall-off later, has anything changed and are we expecting them to return to positive? Tony Crudele : Sure, Chris. This is Tony. When we look at the last three quarters, their performance relative to the control group has been relatively consistent. So the impact on the comps has been again, relatively consistent for the last three quarters. As we move forward, we will start cycling in. And I agree with what you said that we really started to see sort of that fall-off in the third and fourth quarters. So as much as we do anticipate that it will moderate, we do believe that it will still be a drag in the back half of the year, but not to the extent that it has been in the first half. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks and congratulations Tony. Were there any undertones that discretionary spending is slowing or the weather just make it very difficult to judge that? Greg Sandfort : Simeon, let me take that one. I would tell you that what we saw in the second quarter, we could directly tie that back to the weather and how it slowed the development of some of the businesses. We had a very favorable end of March. And it seems like since we got \u2013 and we had that early Easter shift. And it looks like we had a bit of a reversal in trends, all of a sudden, April and May versus where we were at the end of March. And we started seeing some pullback a little bit on big ticket because we had seen a good pull forward at the end of first quarter. So we thought well, that\u2019s just going to be a trade-off between a couple of months. But as we said in the 29th update, we really haven\u2019t seen anything significant with the customers\u2019 use of credit or shift to spending and so on and so forth at this point. It\u2019s fundamentally they are still buying the things they need, they are still shopping for us, our traffic counts are up. So, it was a bit of a tough pill to swallow when we saw the business just not develop and then, again, little warmness in June and we saw a nice push again in the business. So, it\u2019s just very unusual, but no, I can\u2019t say that we have anything that would give us any indication that there is some current trend with the consumer, because we would have seen some of the signals and we haven\u2019t seen it. Our core business couldn\u2019t be stronger. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up on inventory\u2019s gross margin, Tony, made a comment regarding the third quarter that there is not a big transitional quarter, a big markdown quarter. I guess you are not getting the pickup in seasonal July. One, is there some carryover risk from those items? And then if we do see some \u2013 when we talk in the third quarter, if we do hear that there was some markdown, what would explain that? Our markdown during the quarter, what would have explained that or is that just likely out of the question? Steve Barbarick : Simeon, Steve Barbarick here. I thought the team did a really nice job managing to the demands of the business. And we saw that early and we are able to pullback in a lot of the ordering. And our seasonal inventories are in a great position right now for spring. So, I have very little concern about markdown or clearance going into the third quarter or fourth quarter for spring product. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated. Ben Bienvenu : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations, Tony. Tony Crudele : Great, thank you. Ben Bienvenu : So, just following on that question as it relates to inventory and some of the variability that we have seen around weather. Has there been any deviation or evolution in the number of resets that you anticipate to do for the fall selling period or do you anticipate sticking with that traditional reset cadence? Greg Sandfort : We went back and we looked at what we are doing in the back half of this year and looked at the categories that maybe most impacted that we think that our customers still have a lot of demand for. And we have modified our approach slightly, but it\u2019s really around some key areas. And I feel really good about the reset work that we are going to be doing. So, it is around a lot of the C.U.E. merchandise. But in addition to that, we went back, we have reset our stores for footwear and leather and in rubber. We have got heating resets that are going to be taking place and assortment adjustments there as well. So generally, when you look across the four walls, I feel very confident that the work the team is doing is going to be in line with what we are seeing our customer demand for. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. And then you touched in the past on some ammo tests in a handful of stores. I would be curious to hear how that\u2019s progressing? And then any change in thought process either around extending the number of stores that offer that SKU set and/or potentially adding firearms of some kind to your assortment? Greg Sandfort : Yes. I would tell you, at this point, it\u2019s still early in the test. It\u2019s in 25 stores and we are getting some results now. We still need to dissect it and determine whether or not it meets our threshold for being a successful test, so that it would roll forward in more stores. In terms of firearms, it\u2019s way too early in the game to even talk about that. So, I would leave that for future date. Ben Bienvenu : Fair enough. Thanks and best of luck. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon and my congratulations as well to Tony and to Kurt also. I want to just look at the mix dynamic in Q2. Far back as I can remember when you have had these late springs or colder springs, you usually have had this mix benefit because of the lower OPE sales. It seemed like there was a bit of a change here in Q2 and you identified there was some higher margin items. Could you just maybe provide some more specifics there and anything that\u2019s kind of surprised you on the weakness? Tony Crudele : Sure. When it comes to the bigger ticket, we definitely had a benefit, in particular, when it came to the riding mower category. So, the softer sales in that category did help margin, because it is well below chain average. When we look at some of the other key departments, obviously, the first thing that comes to mind is the strength of the C.U.E. items, in particular, the animal feed and pet food, which have just a slightly below chain average margin. But that strength obviously de-levers on margin. So, that had a negative impact. And then when you look at some of the other spring items that are higher margin, that were soft as well and even some of the other hard line items, the softness in those sales, we didn\u2019t obviously pickup the margin there as well. So, those two factors offset the benefit that we get on the larger ticket hard line category. Peter Keith : And anything there, in that last comment, Tony, that was different from previous cold springs? Tony Crudele : Generally, we would have some key categories of spring that would sell well. In this case, some of those categories, we didn\u2019t get that lift. So, we would generally get some offset. And so it just \u2013 we just didn\u2019t have the same lift that we would get from the other higher key categories. I know Steve has some comments that he would like to make. Steve Barbarick : Yes. A year ago, when we were sitting here talking about the strength of the business, a lot of it was driven by seasonal and a lot of it was driven \u2013 we had a new OPE lineup. We saw demand across the board in trailers and a lot of other categories. And we were comping that this year, in all fairness. And to your stack, I think you would feel really good about, but unfortunately, we are comping ourselves and we \u2013 that\u2019s what we need to be doing and we didn\u2019t do it like we should have this quarter. But if you looked at the totality of the business, it\u2019s still strong, there are some very strong fundamentals in the business, but we are lapping what was a very robust Q2 last year in the seasonal category. Peter Keith : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Steve, while I have you, too, so you have mentioned you have rolled out the new and improved inventory allocation system, do you have any early wins or insights you could share and how might that benefit the back half of the year? Steve Barbarick : Yes. It\u2019s rolled out now to the entire team. And I would tell you I really do think it\u2019s going to have a positive impact on the business. It\u2019s really going to help us mainly with things like end caps, event merchandise, a lot of the seasonal builds, both initial and end of season. And those are the ones that are going to get the greatest benefits. And talking with the team, we believe we will see a lot of those benefits in Q4 because the work we are doing right now is going to have that impact. Peter Keith : Okay, thanks a lot guys. Good luck in the back half. Steve Barbarick : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats Tony. Good luck. So, the one thing I was trying to sort of understand on the weather, if we think about that $25 million pull forward into 1Q and sort of normalize for that, it\u2019s about 140 bps, I think to 2Q and you kind of add it in, pull it out of 1Q and it does actually look like the underlying rate slowed. Is that a fair way to think about it or do you think that doesn\u2019t really capture the entire seasonal effect? And if you could maybe just give us a number, an all-in number on the weather impact for 2Q. If you guys have something in your head, that would be pretty helpful, too? Greg Sandfort : Stephen, I think what you are referring to is if you try to normalize, looking at the pull forward and you push that through and kind of work the numbers that I think what you are saying is did we see a bit of a slowdown in second quarter just in general from what we saw in first quarter in sales if we did that. Stephen Tanal : Yes, X the weather, like the core kind of trend rate here. Greg Sandfort : Well, with the slowdown that we did see was, again, in the big ticket categories. No question that was part of it, but we believe that, that was due to the fact that the weather just was not complementary for selling those kinds of products. Our customers, as you know buy very much to need. And so when we looked at that and we did some normalization of our own with the numbers. Those big ticket categories are riding lawnmowers, as Steve mentioned and a few other categories, UTVs now which were very robust a year ago at this time, did not anniversary themselves. Stephen Tanal : Understood. But just to be clear, is the big ticket impact part of that $25 million or not? Greg Sandfort : Some, but not... Tony Crudele : It definitely is. Greg Sandfort : Yes, yes. Tony Crudele : We got off to a very strong rider season in March and so we clearly had anticipated that rolling through into Q2. Greg Sandfort : But it didn\u2019t roll through. Tony Crudele : But it didn\u2019t. And as we stated in the prepared remarks, big ticket was down 8% and in particular, after being very strong in the March timeframe. So, you can adjust the month, but still, the trend was very consistent to the overall trends, where April and May were softer than June. Stephen Tanal : Okay, got it. And just lastly, as we think about kind of the weather, obviously, a big topic of everything that\u2019s happening, it\u2019s been hot, which I think is generally good, but it\u2019s also been dry. And I think in June, we typically like wetter weather. And to be honest, I am not sure what we root for in July. Does the dryness hurt you? Do you want it to be wetter in general or how should we think about weather just high level? Greg Sandfort : Well, for the most part, we do prefer wet because things will continue to grow and it\u2019s a continuation of spring. But when you look at the moisture generally throughout the springtime, we have good moisture throughout. So as we move into the summer, it shouldn\u2019t be a significant impact. Obviously, when you look at the drought map, tends to be a little bit in sort of the Southwest and the California area. But because there is too much rain in say the Texas area, the heat is good because it helps dries out a little bit sooner. But generally, we look for moisture. It will be a positive thing as we move through the year. Stephen Tanal : Great. And just last one for me, if there is any update you could share on that \u2013 I am sorry the inbound freight issues with the Casa Grande, have you made some headway with the vendors or have you switched up vendors, how is that going? Steve Barbarick : This is Steve. This is going to be an ongoing challenge for our merchant team and our sourcing team, to continue to bring new folks on. We have made some headway in that, but when you are talking about as many product categories as we carry and 70-plus percent of those go through our network. This is not a one and done kind of scenario. So we are making headway. We have got about another 20 or 30 vendors that we are looking at right now in terms to trying either resource or find secondary vendors out West to be able to reduce those stem miles. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Thank you very much guys. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : This is Chris Bottiglieri on for Scott Mushkin. Our first question was, taking a step back, you guys have \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s a very strong track record, but it seems more recently, the annual comp algorithm has kind of slowed a bit. So one, kind of like putting weather aside in the last couple of quarters, but in the last couple of years, like why do you think this is happening. And then as a follow-up, like do you think that your current growth initiatives can lead to reaccelerated comp algorithm looking forward or are you kind of comfortable in this range? Greg Sandfort : Chris, let me start with that. Tony will probably jump in. I have been with the company now \u2013 I will be 9 years in November. And I would say that the last 4 years had been the most interesting from a standpoint of the mix of our products, when things were selling, when things peaked, introductions of newness and so on. But I can\u2019t underestimate and we used to \u2013 I think things that we could control more things around some of the weather patterning across the country, but as we have gotten now into 49 states and that store dispersion is a good thing generally. I would tell you that it makes it more challenging for us to understand sometimes how these ebb and flows will affect the overall business on an annual basis. We typically can work our way through some of these slight, if you call it, troubled spots where we have, I will say, less than ideal weather and less than ideal conditions for selling certain products. But we are in a new learning curve here I believe, as we look at some of these things moving forward. And the team has done some great work as we forecast forward through the second half and into next year. And I am convinced that we can kind of push this thing back on this growth trajectory that is kind of expected from Tractor. I mean we are a test and learn company. We learn all the time. There is no lack of newness, as Steve mentioned earlier. We continue to introduce new products and those are things that really drive all the footsteps. And then we are getting far better at this localization component. And that\u2019s going to be a key as we go forward because that helps us defend ourselves when conditions are less than ideal for selling some products. I can\u2019t reiterate enough, our customers buy to demand or to need. They don\u2019t buy early, they haven\u2019t been for a long time. Tony Crudele : And I will just add that over my 11 years here, we don\u2019t necessarily see what the next silver bullet is going to be, but being the test and learn, we are constantly coming up with really good ideas and products. And we let our customer dictate what the next best item is going to be. But when it comes to the model itself, generally our forecasting is always in the 3% to 5% range. We don\u2019t need to reach the high single-digit comps anymore to have a really successful year. And so as we look out, we think that the model will work just terrifically at the 3% to 5% comp level. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, great. You guys absolutely had strong track record didn\u2019t mean to take anything away from there. Just one brief follow-up about the C.U.E. strategy, how much do you think is left in that, like what inning do you think we are in, if you benchmark yourself to the industry, like talking to your suppliers, are you taking share there, like do you think your customers have adopted the premium brand in the space like kind of what\u2019s left there you think in the C.U.E. like the next, call it 3 years to 5 years? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve. We still see more opportunity here and we have seen continued growth over the last several years. And it\u2019s really driving footsteps into our stores. Our focus is really around being priced right. It\u2019s about having the right inventories. And it\u2019s about expanding our assortments. And we have continued to do that very well. I still think that there is upside and a lot of momentum here that we still have. Depending upon the category you look at, I will use \u2013 if you benchmark maybe our overall pet business versus industry, I think if you looked at that, you would probably say we are outstripping and indexing higher than industry and therefore you would have to make the assumption that you are taking share. If you look at our feed business, I would tell you, based on what we hear from our suppliers, there is a good likelihood that we are taking market share there as well. And you could go across the four walls, whether it would be in lubricants, whether it would be in lawn and garden or other categories such as betting. And I think we continue to do a nice job, offering a great assortment that has the right in-stock at great value prices for our customers every day. So I still think that there is a more upside here. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, great. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon everybody. Best wishes to you Tony. Just a real quick question on the big ticket items in this most recent quarter, are there attached products that went missing because somebody wasn\u2019t buying an ATV say, a trailer or hitches, things like that, that took away from the total sales beyond just the big ticket merchandise? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve. And that\u2019s a great question because when you talk seasonal, there is a lot of attachments that come with OPE. There is a lot of replacement parts and whatnot. And we saw a relative softness across many of those compared to a year prior\u2019s strong comp store sales there. So many of those attachments and accessories do carry a little higher margin that was a question asked earlier and we did see those sales be soft over the course of the second quarter. Chuck Cerankosky : Alright. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Greg, the way that these three measures new store productivity began to weaken a bit about a year ago I know that from your perspective, it really hasn\u2019t had much change, but based on the publicly available information, that\u2019s how the number shake out. And then a few quarters after that, we saw the weakness, the negative comps in the fourth quarter last year and now another negative quarter, if you have any concern from your part that perhaps some of the weaker new store openings could be a leading indicator of, call it, saturation and that could be contributing to this current sales trend? Greg Sandfort : Dan, what I can tell you is the facts. No question, when we first opened the new Western markets, we saw some weakness there in a few markets and that drag for about 1 year and 18 months was there. But the process we use in finding and aligning new stores and how we plan for cannibalization in this, we are seeing a more normalization again. We are seeing stores performing back to that level. And on a year-over-year basis, the run rates are very similar. So we did have a little period of time there when it was, gee, what happened and we looked at it and it was really very concentrated in really the Utah market. So no, we are not seeing new store productivity sliding. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s as good today as it was a few years back. But we did have a little blip in there and I think we got to \u2013 we worked our way through that. Dan Wewer : The second question I have revolves around Revionics and your pricing optimization, you have been very bullish about the benefit to gross margin rate, in light of the recent sales trends, have you taken a fresh look at elasticity of demand and perhaps come to the conclusion perhaps we squeeze about as much out of pricing as we can and in fact, maybe there is the case that we make for becoming more promotional, which sounds like you did during the quarter? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Dan, this is Steve. I mean, the pricing tools that we use in regular price are ongoing, and they give us recommendations based on demand by area of the country. So we are constantly looking and fine-tuning that, challenging it ourselves. And where we have upside, we take it up. And where we think we need to be more aggressive, we will move those prices down. So from that perspective, I think that there is still more we can get out of the tools. As a matter of fact, we just recently extended our contract with Revionics because we continue to see value there. In addition to that, the clearance module that we use has still been very effective for us and helping us work our way through a lot of that product while it\u2019s still in home before it gets moved and try to move it through while we\u2019re still in season. Our units in terms of SKU products, we\u2019re still seeing strong comp store units movement, and we really track units as much as we do sales in many cases. Now you\u2019ve heard the last couple of years, we have seen some deflation there, so we have got some headwinds to overcome. But generally speaking, I still think that there is some more opportunity for us in using that tool. Dan Wewer : Okay. And just real quickly on the comments about July, we have known that the year-over-year comparison would be difficult for 12 months. In fact, as I recall, July of 2014 was a very strong month for Tractor Supply as well. So based on your comments about the first 2 weeks of July of 2016, are you saying they are weak, but that\u2019s exactly the way it was budgeted or is the company communicating \u2013 we knew it was going to be a tough comparison. Could you even take that input now, we are running below where we thought we would be? Tony Crudele : Dan, this is Tony. Let me answer that one. What we are saying is that we did not see a shift of sales, spring sales from Q2 into Q3. And so we are not making a statement one way or the other relative to the performance to our expectations or comparison to comps of last year. I will say \u2013 and I would say I am in agreement with you. We have had three very strong Julys in a row. And obviously, when we look out and we forecast, we would forecast July not to be the strongest of the three months in the quarter. Dan Wewer : So your cautiousness, this reflects the fact that you are not recovering the sales lost in April and May, but you are not necessarily saying that the current run-rate is below plan, it\u2019s just that you are not making up for the ground that was lost? Tony Crudele : That\u2019s correct. Dan Wewer : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes, I will keep this one short given the timeframe here. Tony, you referenced earlier and you have said this in the past, what spring should be good for at 3Q trends since it does extend the growing season. Are you expecting any benefit from that \u2013 this, call it, third quarter or is something different this year? Tony Crudele : No. As we stated, we had anticipated that with the moisture and with the slow start to the spring that it would be a delayed spring and would continue into Q3. But since we did not experience that bounce back in June, we were very cautious and did not anticipate extending out. So yes, it is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But we did not expect any additional spring sales in the July, August timeframe. Scot Ciccarelli : But haven\u2019t you discussed in the past that more moisture in the ground actually helps you kind of throughout the balance of 3Q or am I misunderstanding that? Tony Crudele : No, I think that\u2019s correct. And again, as we saw throughout the quarter, with the softness in sales as well as the big ticket being soft as well as having the last sort of 3 years of strong Q3, in particular, strong July, August, it\u2019s just is a more difficult comparison. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, I will follow-up later. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : Yes, good morning. I am sorry, good afternoon everyone. Just to focus on margins for a couple of minutes here. As we look to the second half of the year, what are the major puts and takes in the gross margin line in the third and fourth quarters? Is it more the impact of inbound freights on C.U.E. on the West Coast, D.C., is it mix? Just as we think about how the weather plays out, what are the different things we should try and think about? Tony Crudele : As we move into the back half of the year, they tend to be \u2013 the margins as well as most of the P&L tends to be a little bit more predictable. Now obviously, as we work our way through the quarter and sales and how we react to sales and continue to drive sales, obviously, we can have an impact. But really, as we look year-over-year, there is not any significant aberrations from last year that we are going to be comping. So I would say generally, relatively consistent. We look to see that in both quarters, we anticipate improving our gross margin, which will help us drive the EBIT margin improvement for the overall company and in the back half of the year. Adam Sindler : So slightly higher gross margins both in the third and fourth quarters? Tony Crudele : Correct. Adam Sindler : Okay. And then on the expense line, I mean, so that is one thing that really sort of has changed quite a bit over the last 3 years, not only has sales, but a little bit as you pulled back your square footage and as you\u2019ve lost the very significant benefit of inflation that you had several years ago. But your SG&A is now running up closer to 10% a year versus maybe 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% a year, and then that\u2019s converged with sales. So obviously, there\u2019s a need to continue to invest in the business. But at the same time, sort of what is the thought process around what can be done perhaps to try and get a little bit of a greater spread between sales, dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth? Tony Crudele : True. We continuously look at cost savings initiatives. And in actuality, we feel that we have been very successful. One, in managing headcount both at the store support center and in the stores and you can see that in Q2 in particular as we really managed the payroll expense and the variability relative to the softer sales. And we have some key initiatives looking at all levels of expense structure. So when you look at the increase, we believe that it really is very focused on growth areas and areas that we need to make investment in. And as I alluded to in our prepared remarks, as much as we only ran about a 6% increase year-over-year, net of the incentive compensation, we do expect as we continue to move forward to be in \u2013 somewhere in the 9% to 10% range, consistent with our growth in sales, in particular because some of the investments that we made last year that we are cycling in particular, the Arizona distribution center and the mixing center. Adam Sindler : Alright. I guess longer-term though, they are never \u2013 at least as you stand right now, it\u2019s sort of just perpetuity investment mode, is that the way to think about it? Tony Crudele : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say perpetuity, but as we continue to grow the chain at obviously a fairly significant clip of 110 to 120 stores, we are going to continue to invest in the infrastructure and that\u2019s where the majority of the dollars are going. Adam Sindler : Okay, alright. Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Hi. Two things, first of all from a competitive standpoint, Greg I think you have mentioned localization and the opportunities there, I am just curious from a competitive standpoint, if you are seeing anything different, if you are seeing challenges or opportunities in that regard that you sort of look forward to pursuing? Greg Sandfort : Eric, are you talking about \u2013 let me say competitive, you mean other farm store competitors in particular? Eric Bosshard : You could say farm store or broaden it and say basically, where else your customers may acquire the product they get at your store? Greg Sandfort : Yes. I would say to you that from a competitive standpoint, I think the overall farm community or farm business is probably fairly healthy from a retail standpoint. And we are opening stores in markets where the competition is at. Vice versa, they are opening a few in our markets. And we have plans and I will call it tactics to challenge that and offset that. So we are not seeing any real competitive intrusion to any great degree, anything different than we have seen in the past. One of the things we don\u2019t and will not do is go and try to buy sales for the short-term. Steve mentioned earlier that we are going to look at all the ways that we can be in front of our customer with our mix and the brand itself. But the more stores that we put out there in the landscape, the more often and more chances we have to win customers over. So I think our plans as we go forward are solid. I think our store expansion strategy is solid. And there is not a competitive intrusion that\u2019s causing any issues for us at this point. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly, just to understand, from a big ticket standpoint obviously, dilutive to the second quarter comp, do you expect big ticket to run below the average comp in the third quarter as well? Tony Crudele : That\u2019s obviously pretty difficult for us to project. Being the optimistic retailers, we want to take each one of our categories and drive a comp increase in each one of those categories. As we look at the back half, it tends to be less sensitive to big ticket. However, as we saw last December there, we do have some big ticket items. Our focus is going to be to continue to drive value. And as Greg has indicated, our core business has been very strong. So we are going to continue to emphasize in those key categories that will drive footsteps. And hopefully, as we get those customers into the store, we will be able to get them to create a bigger basket and drive the comp sales in the back half of the year. Eric Bosshard : Great. And then just one last point, in terms of core categories being strong, which is great to hear, anything within the core categories that have slowed a little bit relative to where they were previously or is that sort of other than big ticket, everything else is running basically where it\u2019s been? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Eric, this is Steve. I would tell you that the business continues to be pretty strong in a lot of those basic core businesses. I mean Tony I believe talked about it in his prepared remarks that we continue to see good growth in the animal side of our business across all species. And so I don\u2019t see a slowdown there whatsoever. I think we continue to invest in those businesses and our assortments, our prices and our in-stock and we are seeing the traction and the benefit of those investments. Eric Bosshard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a final question for Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good evening. Greg Sandfort : Good evening. Seth Basham : With the business not bouncing back as much as it historically has in June and July with the high moisture levels and the late spring, is that bounce more limited in big ticket or in the core consumables part of the business? Greg Sandfort : It clearly was not in the big ticket categories. And one of the things you need to understand about our business is that there is a cycle and timing to this. And when you get past a certain point \u2013 we know our customer and they will say to us, it\u2019s too late in the season now to buy that x product. I will wait now until next year. And we have heard that in a number of instances as we have been out in the stores ourselves, so that really is the culprit right there. Seth Basham : Got it. And as you assess the move into selling more kayaks and more UTVs based on what you experienced this season, is it something that you continue to expect to repeat next year or if you change the merchandising plan around those types of outdoor rec categories? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve. Well, we had a challenging overall top line. I would tell you that there were a lot of gems in the quarter. We talked about a lot of what we did with gardening, in organics, sustainability. We saw a lot of growth there. We saw a lot of growth in our Chick Days event and a lot of what we are doing there as well. When it comes to what we are doing with our outdoor rec, we saw nice growth. Our kayak business really drove a lot of incremental units and top line sales there. So there is a lot of things in the box that are working incredibly well and I know that gets overshadowed by the overall top line sales for the quarter. But I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say a lot of that as well as our core business being strong and the foot traffic coming in for those categories. So again overall, when you look at the quarter, it was a miss. And I think we are all disappointed by that, but at the same time we can build on those things that really worked this year for next year. And those categories that suffered this year a little bit, we will have a plan to reconcile. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good luck. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And Mr. Sandfort there are no further questions, I will turn the call back to you for any closing remarks. Greg Sandfort : Okay. Well, thank you, all for your continued support and your interest in Tractor Supply. And we look forward to speaking to you again in October regarding our third quarter performance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation.",

I\u2019m now pleased to introduce Greg Sandfort, Tractor Supply Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Greg, please go ahead. Greg Sandfort : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller. As we previously discussed in our business update earlier in September, there were several headwinds affecting our business during the third quarter. We have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort gathering and analyzing data during the quarter to understand more fully the impact these headwinds have had on our performance, and we do not believe the current sales trends are the result of significant shifts in the competitive landscape, our market share growth or our long-term operating fundamentals. In fact, our core everyday business in categories such as livestock and pet remained strong throughout the third quarter and our business outside of the energy and agricultural markets in regions like the Southwest and West performed very well for the quarter. We did however experience softer demand in the energy and agricultural markets and we saw a slow start to the early pre-season sales of cold weather and heating related products that impacted the Northern region. We have managed successfully through challenging sales environments before. The recession of 2008, 2009, and during those most difficult sales periods, our teams remained focused on managing the factors they could control, such as inventory, gross margin, and other expenses. We made the necessary adjustments then by taking a long-term, balanced approach as we cycled through those periods, and we will do the same for now until these short-term headwinds subside. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to introduce new products and updating the merchandising categories to keep our stores fresh and with the current sales environment we are specifically targeting those categories that have demonstrated strong sales performance year-to-date. Already this fall season we have had several series of calls with field leadership across several of our more challenged markets to understand the depth of the issues we face. As a result of those calls, we executed a number of timely inventory investments to ensure that we have the appropriate emphasis on categories of high demand in those regions that are performing well, categories such as pet food, agricultural fencing, and grass seed, to name a few. Additionally, recognizing that cold weather and winter preparedness sales were slower to ramp, we adjusted our inventories downward on cold weather products and upward on warm weather regional categories where customer demand stayed high, such as fly control, riding lawn mowers, short-sleeve shirts and packaged seeds. Having this agility to react to current sales trends, we believe is a level of sophistication and capability that differentiates us from most of our competition. Now, with respect to our management of seasonal inventory, we are monitoring sales trends closely and continue to adjust for ongoing customer demand. For example, in the heating category, which I mentioned earlier, we have experienced sluggish early demand and we have kept inventories at a minimum for now. When sales trends accelerate due to cooler weather, our supply chain and our vendor base are ready to react and we'll push inventory into our DCs, then into our stores quickly, so that we can meet the increased sales demands. Also in many of our everyday basic items queue, we have elevated in-stock levels to meet the continuing strong demand for animal, pet and land care needs. While we may be a chain of 1,500 plus stores, what is important to understand about our customer is that they perceive Tractor Supply as their unique farm store, conveniently located in their small community that offers them locally correct assortments that meet the unique outdoor lifestyle needs they have. Now on the marketing front, we adjusted Q3 and forward programs based on current sales trends by region in an effort to accelerate our comp store sales. We added radio advertising to promote key events during the quarter, such as our annual Pet Appreciation Week and lowest prices of the season event. We enhanced our digital impressions to our web customers and increased our circular distribution to a larger base of our best customers. And we added several targeted sales driving initiatives in key sales weeks to improve our overall sales and marketing effectiveness. To demonstrate how we are focusing on the growth of our business for the long-term, we are continuing to invest in technology to improve our capture of customer insights. This includes the rollout of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program which we believe will give Tractor Supply a unique way to communicate with our customer base by offering a more relevant and personalized message. As well, we completed bringing our customer database in house, so that we could better analyze and segment the customer information that we are collecting from our Neighbor Club members. We added an additional 45 stores to the Neighbor's Club program on October the 1st in the Western region and with the initial customer enrollment and customer response being so positive we now plan to roll the program out to all stores by the middle of 2017. We continue to invest in the platforms where our customers choose to shop, giving them more options in the way they can interact with the Tractor Supply Company as a brand. This includes the introduction of Buy Online Pickup in Store, which we started piloting in September and expect to have live in over half of the chain by the end of this year. We are also continuing to invest in our Tractor Supply website to improve search capabilities and to enhance the know-how section for product content and projects that are important to our customers, using videos and online articles. And we continue to invest in store level resources including mobile POS, and a more intuitive special order process that will assist our team members and our customers to locate hard to find products. As a company, we remain confident in our long-term store target of 2500 domestic Tractor Supply locations and mid single digit annual square footage growth. To help achieve this target, we recently conducted a comprehensive study of our logistics infrastructure to understand what would be required to add capacity and drive more supply chain efficiency as we move toward our long-term store target. One thing to note from the study data, we confirmed that we have a short term need to add additional distribution capacity in the Northeast region if we plan to continue the store growth there. We have begun the planning process to enable the opening of a new distribution center in that region targeted for mid to late 2018. Our recently announced purchase of Petsense, a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services with over 130 stores in 25 states is another example of our commitment to long-term growth. For some time now, we have discussed the pet category as a growth opportunity for the company and based on our research and experience with our own hometown pet concept, we concluded there is a substantial opportunity to grow the pet specialty business in small town America. Their expertise and success in growing a smaller pet specialty store format will allow Petsense to continue at a growth rate of 15% to 20% annually without distraction to the TSC business. Tractor Supply's proven expertise in site selection and store growth should make for a strong partnership with Petsense and allows us to accelerate their growth over time. Over the longer term, we stay focused on our people and their development. On enhancing our merchandise assortments and adding IT capability to better meet the evolving needs of our customers, while always being mindful to return value to our shareholders through sustainable longer term growth. Before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication and the level of service they provide our customers, a big goo-rah [ph] to all. I would also like to welcome the Petsense team as members of the Tractor Supply family. We are proud to be partnered with you and are excited about the opportunity to develop and grow the Petsense business. I will now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2016. Tony Crudele : Great. Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion. Net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million, and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in last year\u2019s third quarter. There are a number of economic headwinds impacting consumer spending throughout many of our markets. However, as noted in our business update on September 7, the energy producing and agricultural markets were the most impacted. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the macro impact of the energy and farm economies, we estimate that approximately 25% of our stores have a direct correlation to these economies. This does not include any of the stores that may be tangentially affected by the economies. The strongest regional performance was in the Southeast and West regions where there is less exposure to the energy and agricultural markets. The West region base had a solid mid single-digit comp, and the Southeast was well above chain average. We continue to experience strong demand from many of our basic everyday items, such as livestock and pet category, which generated mid single digit comparable chain wide sales. While the quarter did not shape up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term. The solid comp sales in the non-impacted regions support our position that the business will continue to drive profitable growth. As Greg said, we have been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to customers, stakeholders and shareholders. Comp transaction count increased for the 34 consecutive quarter, gaining 0.5% on top of a 3.8% increase last year, as some queue items such as pet food and animal feed continue to drive strong traffic. Average comp ticket decreased by 111 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 90 basis point decrease. Big ticket was one of the largest drivers of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 4.7%. The decline was across several categories related principally to the energy and farm markets, as well as early season winter sales in the north. More discretionary items such as UTVs were down in the oil and farm areas. Oil patch related products such as compressors and fuel handling were down. Cold weather related hard lines such as log splitters and stoves were down double-digits, as a result of the lack of urgency, cycling a warm winter season last year and low heating oil prices. On a positive note, we did take advantage of opportunities for some key summer big ticket products, such as riding lawn mowers by working collaboratively with vendors to develop a late season sales driving program. Additionally, the average ticket was negatively impacted by the decline in the units per transaction with pre-season sales of wood burning fuel as the principal driver. We estimated that deflation also decreased the average ticket by approximately 40 basis points. September was the strongest sales month and did register a positive comp, September did have the easiest year-over-year comparison. Now turning to gross margin, which was flat at 34.7% compared to 60 basis point decrease in last year's third quarter. Overall, we are very pleased how the team managed margin during a tough selling environment. We continue to improve our initial margin through our key margin initiatives. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. This resulted from a larger mix of feed and pet food and the strong sales in the riding lawn mower category. With respect to margin rate, we were sharper on price, and as Greg mentioned, added few sales driving initiatives. Freight was essentially flat, lower diesel fuel, lower container costs and a reduction in outbound stem miles were favorable factors. This was offset by higher inbound and outbound costs related to mix and higher lane costs. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales deleveraged by 20 basis points to 25.5% of sales. The deleverage was primarily due to the decline in comparable sales. SG&A expense grew only 5.4% from the prior year, which benefited from a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A expense increased only 7.9%, a continuation of the tight cost control management initiated in the second quarter. Similar to the second quarter, we experienced strong cost control in store level and store support center payroll and medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against a headwind from our Arizona DC and mixing centers. We estimate the deleverage from these centers operations were approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5% in Q3 compared to 36.9% last year, due to additional federal and state tax credits. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 this year we had a cash balance of $55.5 million and $295 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.4 million and a $190 million outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $108.8 million. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.8% compared to 1.6% increase in last year's third quarter and inventory turns decreased slightly. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million last year. We opened up 34 stores, closed one Del stores in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened and two Del stores and one Tractor Supply store closed in the third quarter of 2015. The CapEx this year relates to new store expansion which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project, whereas last year capital included $12.6 million for the Arizona DC. Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results of the third quarter we revised our outlook for the full year - fiscal year 2016 in our September 7th business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. We expect full year sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.75 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1% and 1.7%, and net income to range from $432 million to $438 million and earnings per diluted share to range between $3.22 to $3.26. Assumed in this full year guidance is an EBIT margin decline of 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7%, and capital expenditures of $235 million to $245 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $133.8 million to $134.2 million. As a reminder, we have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that the additional week will provide $0.04 to $0.05 benefit to EPS which is contained in our guidance. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter of approximately 40 basis points. With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to be sharp on price, which will limit the upside on margin. We also expect to have slight headwinds from product mix and transportation expenses as we cycle the decline in diesel prices. Therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year and the fourth quarter. With respect to SG&A, we will continue to drive cost saving programs in the fourth quarter and we will react accordingly to the sales trends. We expect to maintain appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the fourth quarter, and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona DC until we cycle its opening in late December. Although we benefit from slight leverage from the additional sales week, it has very little impact on the quarter. We estimate that the additional week adds approximately 6% to the year-over-year SG&A growth including depreciation. We do not expect to leverage SG&A for the quarter. With respect to Petsense acquisition, as we mentioned in our webcast call on September 29th, we expect one time transaction costs with the majority being recognized in the fourth quarter to be approximately $0.01 to $0.015. There will be some integration costs, but we expect these to be immaterial to our overall financial results. Although not originally included in our full year outlook due do the immaterial or the amount, we did not revise our guidance. Our guidance does not include Petsense sales or operations as we expect the net bottom line impact not to be material. As a few reminders, as we look ahead to 2017, we'll be cycling the 53rd week year and therefore you need to adjust your models accordingly. With the resulting one-week shift in 2017, Q2 will have one less comp day related to the shift in Easter. Additionally in 2016, we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation. We would expect a normalized planned incentive compensation for 2017 and that would represent an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 to the SG&A cost structure. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And once again, I remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And we will take our first question from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Matt McClintock : Hi, yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could maybe update us on the competitive dynamics that you are seeing in some of those challenged energy markets and rural markets, are you seeing anything different there? And then, longer term, if weakness persists, I mean, could we actually argue an acceleration in market share consolidation for those markets? Thanks. Greg Sandfort : Matt, hi. This is Greg Sanford. We are not seeing anything of any substance from a competitive standpoint in even those markets that you mentioned that are challenged right now. The farm store market still has growth and some of the competition are opening some stores. But we are outpacing their growth at a very, very high rate. So, to think there is a competitive threat, I would say no, from another farm store competitor. And that\u2019s what \u2013 we watch that very closely and monitor, but I would say, no, there is not. Matt McClintock : And then if I could ask a follow-up, you reiterated the 2,500 store goal longer term. And if I recall, I believe there might have even been longer term some upside there previously in the past. As I think about that goal, does that imply a recovery in those energy markets to maybe the highs or any recovery at all in those markets? How do we \u2013 how should we think about that? Greg Sandfort : Well, first of all, the modeling that we use would not today say don\u2019t go into those markets because right now they are under some pressure. It would actually tell us that there is a placeholder there for a store based upon all the factors that go into that model, and there is a number of those. And so it would tell us that that\u2019s an ideal location. The one thing I can tell you is that in some of those markets where we\u2019re seeing some challenges today, we are being very diligent when those stores come up for presentation, a real estate strategy. We need to look at them very closely to make sure that they are stores that we believe now today we should be looking toward opening. Now, there is a number of stores already in the pipeline for 2017, and those stores we are going to stay with and run with. We\u2019re talking about stores now that truly are affecting '18 and probably into '19. Matt McClintock : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Just a question on the Neighbors Club and the decision to kind of roll that out for next year. I mean, what kind of impacts are you seeing from it? Can you give us a little bit more color on what has encouraged you and given you the confidence to push this out by the middle of next year? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Peter, this is Steve Barbarick. We started the program back, it was about a year ago in October, and we've been very methodical in watching it. The one thing that's really exciting is the enrollment continues to exceed our expectations. To look at the fact that - I'll give you some numbers here, 80% of the e-mails that we're getting through the program are new to our database and about 50% of the folks that are signing up are also new to our database. So we're getting a real good insight into these individuals. And tracking over the course of the last year, what we're finding is the people that are signing up, and this is of no surprise, tend to be the closest ones to the brand and they do want to hear from us. They tend to shop us more often and they are twice as likely to take advantage of our marketing promotions. So as we move forward with this program, we think that this is a real opportunity to talk more to them. They are typically our best customers and they really want to hear from us. So we think this has a lot of upside in the future. Peter Benedict : And related to that, Steve, the response to the marketing changes you guys made in the fourth quarter, just curious, I mean, what's the plan for the fourth quarter, which of those events or radio or what was the most impactful in your view and how do you guys plan to kind of evolve the marketing in 4Q and then into '17 based on that? Steve Barbarick : You know, lot of what we're doing is not just new, but it's also enhancements of what we're currently doing. So for example, we're using the digital space today more effectively than we've had in the past. And so you'll see us continue to move down that path as we evolve. We still know that a lot of our customers like the traditional marketing that we do. But we will continue to evolve based on what we see it to be most efficient and that's where right now we're kind of moving toward. Peter Benedict : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to just follow up on a comment about September improving. I think the comment was that September was positive. Can you elaborate on that? And I know you said there was an easy comp, but did you see any sort of narrowing of the gap between some of those troubled markets versus the healthier markets? Thanks. Tony Crudele : Sure, Seth. This is Tony. As I mentioned on the remarks, it was an easier comparison, but as we looked at the individual markets, we did see that those markets were still the ones that had the similar trends that we had in the July and August time frame. The one thing in September that did impact September was obviously not getting any type of cold snaps and some of the pre-season heating sales were still down. But again, going up against the easier compare of last year made September a positive comp. Seth Sigman : Okay. And so just to clarify, when you talk about the 25% of the store base, that's either in energy markets or agricultural markets, you are not referring to those stores necessarily getting better in September? Tony Crudele : Yes. When we look at those stores, those are clearly \u2013 I want to say its all ships rise with the current tide. So as we moved into September, obviously, we had stronger comps, but the difference or the delta between sort of a normalized comp and those stores remains similar as it was in July and August. Seth Sigman : Okay. Got it. And then, on the expense side, obviously very well managed this quarter despite the tough environment. How are you thinking about the ability to leverage comps here? I mean, you gave some color on the fourth quarter, but just in general as we look out over the next 12 months, to the extent that comps are maybe below that 3% to 5% long-term target, maybe what are some of the opportunities that the team is focused on to maybe take some expenses out? Tony Crudele : Sure. We've been very aggressive in looking at the expenses for the back half, as we saw sales soften through Q2 and Q3. As we look out, we believe that we can continue to manage those discretionary expenses, such as travel, training, looking at some of the stores, really working with vendor to try to reduce our costs relative to maintenance, supplies, and fixtures and things like that. So obviously, we'll continue to do that. The one thing that's very important to us though is, we look at the long-term and so we do not want to do anything that would jeopardize the business. So we'll continue to make sure that we fund our stores, fund payroll. We want to make sure that we maintain market share and we want to convert those customers and maintain those customers as they come into our store. The one thing that we do mention when we look out over the next 12 months is the incentive compensation piece. Though, obviously it's much reduced this year and we'll be comping up against that as we put in a more normalized incentive compensation, it will make it very difficult to get SG&A leverage. Seth Sigman : Okay. Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So to follow up on that, I mean, I know, you haven't given full guidance for 2017, you have a long-term earnings algorithm out there of 3% to 5% comps and mid-teens earnings growth. And given the state of the world it feels like that's not going to be achievable next year. So any initial thoughts about how you're thinking about the sales outlook for next year and the overall earnings growth would be really helpful? Greg Sandfort : Sure. As we look out, we're still very confident in the long-term store target of the 2500. And we tend - we still want to look out and we believe that we are capable of driving that 3% to 5% comp on a long-term basis. Obviously, as we look at the headwinds that have been presented to us this year, as well as we cannot determine at what point in time they will subside. We will take a harder look at the short term and adjust our comps accordingly. At this point in time though, we're not prepared to give full guidance on 2017. But obviously given the current sales environment, we would agree with the consensus that it would be difficult to hit the longer term target of 3% to 5%. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And just related to that, so then is the message here guys, look we've got $0.05, $0.06 for the 53rd week. You've got $0.07 to $0.08 from the incentive comp normalizing. So if consensus is like 360, is it essentially the message just to take those one-time items and reduce our numbers by that amount to bring it down to that 345 to 350-ish level? Greg Sandfort : Well, obviously, we want you to consider those factors in the model. We are a grower, we're going to continue to grow the store base next year. We anticipate to be above the 100 store range next year. And we - the merchandising team is aggressive as far as putting in programs and looking at new products and trying to drive the comps. So obviously, we're really working hard to have a very strong 2017 campaign. Having said that, we just understand that those headwinds of the 53rd week and the incentive compensation will have an impact on earnings. But again, our mind set here is we want to be double-digit earnings growth, and we\u2019re going to do whatever we can to make sure that happens. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then, just as a follow up, how much of your mix would you say is heating related in the fourth quarter? And then, you know, bigger picture, how much is cold weather related sales as a percentage of mix in fourth quarter as well? Thank you. Steve Barbarick : Yes. Christopher, this is Steve Barbarick. And we typically don\u2019t get too detailed into the numbers. The big picture, we know that animal products is about 40% to 45% of our business, and seasonally it changes. So, again, we\u2019re not going to get that granular here. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It\u2019s on the 25% of the business that\u2019s been underperforming. Did it seem to catch you off-guard that the ag markets are rolling over? So what are you looking for to give you an indication that it\u2019s going to get better? I guess, the point is how long is this going to be a drag on the overall business? Tony Crudele : Well, obviously, Michael, it\u2019s very difficult to project how long that would be. Now, what I would tell you, as far as order of magnitude, the oil markets have been a drag. Obviously, just in the recent weeks you start to see the oil prices coming back. They are having a few more rigs put back into place. Not that that\u2019s going to turn of on a light switch, but obviously it\u2019s more of a positive indication. Next, on the higher key would be really the impact of the cold weather products, and that would be probably the second biggest drag on the comps. And then really, thirdly, it\u2019s the farm economy. And it\u2019s really all three combined, which is having the impact. So as any one of those start to turn, you know, obviously, it would have a favorable impact on the business. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we need all three of them to turn around to start to see the comps really improve dramatically, and of those three factors, farm income probably is the least of the three. Michael Lasser : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Tony. Two points to clarify. You mentioned double-digit earnings growth for next year, are you saying think about double-digit earnings growth and then subtract the incentive comp piece and the extra week piece or is that not the right way to think about it? Tony Crudele : I would say that would be the correct way to look at it. I would say you want to adjust for those items and then this team here is - we are geared towards driving double-digit growth, but we need to adjust for those two factors. Michael Lasser : And then will there be - how should we think about the sales contribution from Petsense in the fourth quarter? Tony Crudele : We're not providing guidance at this time. What we believe is that any bottom line benefit that we would receive would offset the transaction and or integration cost in that quarter. So net-net, bottom line, there is not an impact. Michael Lasser : Thank you. Operator : Our question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Just to circle back on the oil markets, and maybe a little bit on the ag economies too with the economic issues. When you look at the oil markets it's 25% of the base, is that only South Central Texas or could you maybe frame that up for us geographically and then similarly on the - where the ag economies are the worst? Tony Crudele : This is Tony. I'll give you just a little bit more color as best as I can. In the prepared remarks we talked about 25% of the store base and that would include all energy, which would be oil, it could also be coal in the Appalachian area and obviously the farming tends to be mostly in the Midwest and the Great Plains. So - but what we're saying is \u2013 and this is such a broad area of the country. All the stores are getting thrown in there. So it appears to be a much larger piece of business. But when we run our models, we see that the co-relation specifically to all three of those being any of the oil, energy, coal or farm, the co-relation, the direct correlation is only for about 25% of the store base. So those are the ones that are being directly impacted. So, as much as we have a lot of stores in Texas, there is only X amount that are energy impacted. So the first thing is I would not extrapolate it to every store in every state, what we're saying is about 25% of the stores are co-relate directly and have a more significant impact than the rest of the chain. Peter Keith : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And wanted to pivot over to gross margin, curious on the sharper pricing, it sounds like you're having some success there. Is that something that with ongoing sluggishness you would anticipate continuing and is there a possibility to get some vendor support to perhaps mitigate the gross margin impact? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve Barbarick. We have been working with our supplier community. But we use a price optimization tool in systems here and it's been very effective for us. And we continue to drive share in a lot of the key categories that are more price sensitive, like feed and in some cases pet food. I don't want to get too deep into the vendor support, but we do work with our vendors to make sure that when we do promote and we do EDLP pricing that we're competitive and that we are continuing to gain share. Peter Keith : Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on that for Tony, is there some risk of gross margin pressure continuing in a sluggish sales environment or just too tough to tell at this point looking out to next year? Tony Crudele : Obviously, it's too early to tell for next year. As we've done our sensitivities for Q4, we believe that if there is margin pressure with some of the pricing programs we would expect to pick it up on the top line and vice versa, if we aren't overly aggressive on price we'll pick it up on the margin side relative to the models that we ran for the quarter. Peter Keith : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good afternoon. Greg Sandfort : Hi, Steven. Steven Forbes : To start with the top line performance and trends within the different sales categories thus far, so far this year, I know you mentioned live stock and pet rose mid single digits during the quarter, I think that's been relatively consistent. But can you provide some color around the other categories, maybe just touching on the categories you lay out within the SEC filings and how they've trended throughout the year just to give us a better perspective as we look out, kind of over the next 6 to 12 months here as relates to the compares by category? Steve Barbarick : Steven, this is Steve. And I'll try to stay at a fairly high level here, because we can break this thing down in a lot of little pieces and parts. But we talked about the impact that the energy markets have had on ticket. And I would go back and say that categories such as welders, some compressors, those type of businesses have been a bit of a challenge for us. And you can see that in those individual markets where we are impacted most by energy, things like certain apparel, whether it's some steel footwear \u2013 toe footwear or fire retardant apparel, you can actually look into those specific regions and you can pretty much, you know, kind of, estimate what categories are going to be the most impacted there. In terms of the seasonal businesses, we talked about having a fairly soft spring, but then it drug into the fall and that benefited us. But we certainly didn't capture any of the pre-heating sales that we had traditionally gotten. So again, if you look at seasonal, it's kind of a tale of two stories. We prefer to have spring in spring and winter in winter, but that just hasn't necessarily been the case yet. So we're having to move some of our inventories around to better position ourselves to optimize where we think we can. And then the last thing I would tell you is in the truck, tool and hardware business, it's a little similar to what I talked about earlier with some of the big ticket. Truck boxes, fuel handling, those kind of categories have been really soft for us, and again, we believe a lot of that is more energy related. So does that help clarify some? Steven Forbes : Yes, I guess. And then I guess as a follow-up, maybe if we can expand on it regarding the trends in those more discretionary categories, right, the non-maintenance side and not livestock and pet. I mean, I guess just trying to understand the color around of behavioral trends, right, as you think about the consumer shopping the store. I'm not sure if you have visibility via talking to store managers or so forth. Is it \u2013 are the consumers coming into the box, right, because you're clearly driving traffic, the 34th consecutive quarter and are they shopping the rest of the store and just not making \u2013 exploring the side of the store, exploring the merchandising displays and just not making the purchase or are you seeing the consumers come into the store and really just go right for that back section livestock and pet and not even exploring everything you are doing on the merchandising side? And then how does that relate, right to the initiatives you have in place and you are working on, as it relates to space allocation merchandising and promotional activity, right, as you look to curtail those trends? Greg Sandfort : Steven, this is Greg. Let me -I'll make it very simple for you. There is evidence not only in the consumer surveys that we've completed, but in our current sales trends that the customers have become more conservative in their purchasing behaviors. It doesn't mean they are not still buying, but they're buying more conservative, which means they are buying absolutely what they need at the time that they need it. They are still shopping the store as evidenced by the transaction increases that we're seeing. They are still supporting the pet, the animal and some land maintenance and in other categories across the store. So we're not seeing them just cherry pick. They are actually shopping across the store, but they've pulled back considerably on big ticket spends for now. We think there is a number of factors involved there, not just the energy markets and some of the things happening in the ag economy. But we\u2019re going to get to listen again this evening a debate about who is going to be the next President of the United States, and those things have some effect on our customer, no question. We have heard from them in these surveys that they feel their budgets are a bit tighter right now. And as we\u2019ve been monitoring sales trends and looking at this by region, the customer demand for those things that are needed to support the lifestyle continue to exist, they continue to come in and purchase in our stores. So we have got to keep bringing new products. We\u2019ve got to keep updating the merchandise assortment, keeping those stores fresh and I can tell you the consumer count is still there, but they are being very conservative and very thoughtful in their spends. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to ask about farm income, because a couple years ago it actually started to nosedive, and we know from history there was no impact to the business. And actually the deceleration was sharper two or three years ago than any time in 2016. So I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s happening now, why it wasn\u2019t evident before, if something else was sort of hiding the impact, because I think what we\u2019re all trying to get at is it\u2019s hard to quantify, we don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to end. But because you weren\u2019t getting hit by it before, how do we understand the downside? And I\u2019m sure you are trying to figure out the same thing, how are you thinking about it? Greg Sandfort : Simeon, this is Greg. This - when we studied that in years past and up till even this point in time, this is the first time in a number of years that back to back to back years the farm community has suffered losses in the crops that they\u2019ve tried to bring in and sell. There is also a factor in cattle, which most people don\u2019t think about, but in the state of Texas and in the few states north of that it\u2019s a big impact as well, cattle prices, a dollar less per pound. I mean, we hear these things from our customers, and I would tell you that I think it\u2019s more severe now than it was in the past. I\u2019ll also tell you that in the model of our business, this is the first time that we\u2019ve seen energy come into the same kind of a play on top of these other aspects. So multiple things working at the same time, it\u2019s not \u2013 the farm piece we just mentioned this time and said it's more of a factor or at least it's a bit of an overhang because it's the first time in a number of years we can actually say in those communities we're seeing a softness, we didn't see that before. But it's other factors on top of those factors we believe that have caused the drag. Simeon Gutman : So just to following \u2013 I guess clarifying that, not my follow-up yet, but would you say, I guess, there's been a lag or you are saying there's somewhat of a coincidence now just because it's just amplifying some of the other pressures? Greg Sandfort : I think you just answered your own question. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my second question, you know, it sounds like you're stepping up the marketing to help drive the sales. What about any I guess temptation to promote during this environment, Greg, is there any or Steve, I mean, or doesn\u2019t make sense - does not make sense for your business? Greg Sandfort : Simeon, here's how it works, when there's no demand for certain categories of products, there is not a price that you can sell that product to the consumer for. And I'm talking about things like heating, I'm talking about things like possibly large farm equipment or larger pieces of equipment, big ticket items and so on. You have to have the consumer demand. Now we're going to need to be a little patient here and understand that we can maneuver and control inventories in some of those categories where the demand's not great right now, but we want to make sure and Steve would tell you this, that we have the ability to react if the category starts to accelerate. We believe there will still be a heating business this year, but we think it's going to come later. We do believe there will be some outerwear business and some call it seasonal type businesses this year. But until we see some weather improvement, meaning cooler weather, that's not going to transpire. So instead, inventories have been shifted a bit and where we put our \u2013 and placed our bets is on the things within queue and the categories that are retailing right now and doing well. But we have every ability to react when things would move in the right direction and we believe it will come. We don't know the timing of it, but we do believe some of these seasonal trends will shift. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Ben Bienvenu : Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. Tony, I think in the past you had quantified the differential between your energy exposed markets and the rest of the chain to be around 400 to 500 basis points. Is that still the case today in light of sort of the broadening of the store base that's seen weakness and the broadening of the SKU set that's seen weakness? Tony Crudele : Yes, Ben, you're correct, it has - the difference has continued. It's been very consistent over the last three quarters. But where we're disappointed is that, as we had mentioned on a previous conference call, we were hoping that that differential would moderate as we came into the back half of the year and we have not seen that happen. So there still is a relatively large delta and again, until the economies really start to turn a little bit, we expect that we'll have similar delta throughout the end of the year. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. That's helpful. And then, when you look at the ag exposed markets, is it a similar magnitude of differential or is it less or more? Any quantification you could provide there would be helpful. Tony Crudele : Sure. The differential is a little bit less and it's very, very less number of stores as well. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. Thanks. Best of luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin : Thank you much. Thank you. Just to follow up on a couple of earlier questions. So you've cited agricultural impacts, as well as energy as two of the three reasons. So can you just try to help us delineate the impact between just those two variables on the business? Greg Sandfort : I'm sorry, which two, the ag\u2026 Alan Rifkin : Agriculture and energy. Now I understand the impact from both of them, but are you able to segregate the effect of agriculture alone on the business versus energy alone? Greg Sandfort : Well, at times it's very difficult to segregate the two because you may have some that cross both. But I would try to give you a generalization of the magnitude is probably at least three to one when it comes to the impact of oil on the comps versus farm on the comps. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up, you are now talking about 113 stores for this year, whereas last quarter you were talking about 115 to 120. When you take that together with your earlier statement, Tony, that next year you are going to open up \u201cabove 100 store range\u201d. Should we think of your square footage in 2017 really being closer to 6% rather than the 7%, 7.5% versus what some people thought, and why the slippage of anywhere from 2 to 7 stores for this year? Thank you. Tony Crudele : We're currently assessing the store target for next year. I would tell you that we have the majority of stores already in place and signed. As we move towards that north of 100 to 120 range, I would tell you that we would be very discriminate in the softer sales environment and making sure that we make the right choices on those stores as we of move forward. But we'll give you more guidance on the next conference call in January as to the 2017 store plan. Alan Rifkin : Are you at liberty to say how many of the stores for 2017 are already signed? Greg Sandfort : I would say \u2013 well, we don't usually give out that number. But I would say that number is defined, this is Greg. And I want you to think about something that most people don't realize, Alan. Back in '08 and '09, we were growing our store base at 10%. We saw a similar type of headwind occur and we said, you know what, we're going to slow down to about 7% to 8% and hold there for a while until the economies at that time would improve. We're seeing a little bit of the same kind of drag, a little different variables this time than last. So Tony's comment earlier about you know, we may not be at the 115, 120, that's always been a target, by the way. In real estate, you can in a moment's notice lose two or three stores because deals can't be completed or there is a problem with the contractor or what have you. So for 2016, that's more of the instance. We wanted to get more stores opened, we just could not. But we'll talk more about that in specific as we get through the fourth quarter and we give our guidance for next year. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Greg Sandfort : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey, thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just want to clarify a couple things. The stores that are not in the 25% that are feeling the wins of oil and agriculture, are they comping 3% to 5% in your \u2013 just to be very specific? Greg Sandfort : When it comes to those stores comping 3% to 5%, as we mentioned the Southeast and the West. The Southeast more on the lower end, the West is actually exceeding the upper end. Now, again, I'd point out that the West has a less mature store base, given the stores that we opened over the last couple years. So we would expect them to comp a little bit stronger, but they have had very strong sales in those areas. Again, those stores that are highly correlated, obviously, the gap with a normalized comp is much greater, and then there is a swath of stores that range in between those numbers. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. Then, one other clarification. I know you guys talked about September, two weeks into October, is the momentum continuing? Greg Sandfort : Well, what we see in October are similar trends as in September, and as we moved into this quarter, we did anticipate that October will be the toughest compare. And obviously the quarter is going to really be driven by November and December and the type of weather that he we have in those two months. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. Now, to my real question, so much more of a kind of a secular question. So, obviously, you guys have some cyclical issues now. But if you kind of take a longer view, comps have been kind of slowing for a while, return on invested capital turned down about 18 months. How do you kind of view this? And then, of course, you went out and made an acquisition, an adjacent acquisition. How do you view more the - what looks to be more of a secular slowing of the business versus what\u2019s going on cyclically? And thank you for taking my questions. Greg Sandfort : Well, what I would tell you initially is that when you look back at the comps, we\u2019ve had some very nice comps over the last 3 years and in an environment with mostly deflation. And obviously, as we get into some of these periods where we have a downturn in the economy, we\u2019re going to be impacted. But we continue to believe that we\u2019ll make the necessary adjustments with the merchandising, we'll continue to drive strong store performance. And as these economies turn, we're going to be very well positioned to continue towards our long-term goal of 3% to 5% comps. Scott Mushkin : All right. Thanks, guys. Greg Sandfort : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : Okay. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, a lot of ground covered. And I guess, just a question for Steve maybe, is there anything going on in merchandising, any initiative that you guys are thinking about or new product categories or specific products, if you will, anything that you\u2019re excited about that we should be thinking about here, as we look out quarter or two quarters and maybe even into next year? Steve Barbarick : You know, there is a lot going on in the merchandising front. I would tell you that the team is all over certain trends right now. We continue to see in the pet and animal side people stepping up the premium, natural foods. We've just expanded a number of organic products in the stores. We still see our customers tend to self reliant. So the thing that we're doing with chicken supplies and beekeeping, we've got resets that are taking place throughout the store right now on both sides that we think we can capitalize on things like premium, rubber footwear and things in truck accessories. So there is a variety of things. We've always said that we're a test and learn company, and we've been testing and learning a lot, and we're rolling and expanding a lot of programs out. So from that perspective, there is still a lot in the hopper. Just most recently we expanded our animal test from 25 stores to 100 stores, thinking that this would be a good quarter to learn a little bit more in. In sporting goods, for example, we've got premium coolers and kayaks and other things going on. So if I were to walk a store with you and walk through the entire four walls, I would tell you there's something happening in about every area. Stephen Tanal : Okay. That's good to hear. And moving on to the loyalty card, I don't know - some companies from time to time actually quantified a lift that you get from sales. I don't know if there's anything like that that you see. Obviously over time there's more you can do with the data. But I'm curious to know if there has been a lift in sort of the test markets? Steve Barbarick : Stephen, this is Steve again. I would tell you that it's still early in the game for us. While we've got a handful of stores that have comped the first year, we're now just comping over last year's and we're going to be able to give you much better indication on the next call. But I will tell you we wouldn't be expanding it if we didn't feel like we were getting a benefit. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Thanks. I believe in some prior calls you noted that e-commerce revenues were less than 1% of total, certainly recognize there are some of these products that are not friendly for online shopping. But nevertheless would you think that your penetration should be exceeding that level given the investments that have been made? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Dan, this is Steve again. I would tell you that we're seeing nice momentum in this space. We've added a number of new lines, online in content and we're seeing good growth there, as you know, that we've invested in the new platform. We've mobile optimized our website to ensure there is a consistent consumer experience across the device. And most recently the impact of Buy Online Pickup in Store is having a very positive impact on our business. I think that alone tied in with the initiatives we have, some around the fulfillment side, you'll see that percentage grow over time and once it becomes more material, we'll be able to share with you exactly where we're at. But I would tell you that there's a lot of work being done and we're very excited about what we're doing right now. And we're seeing the results of it. Dan Wewer : Second question. I know that you are still targeting 3% to 5% secular same store sales growth. Can that be achieved if energy markets stabilize at current levels? Or do those markets need to rebound to where they were, say, 2 or 3 years ago to achieve that 3% to 5% company wide target? Greg Sandfort : Hey, Dan, this is Greg. Very difficult to predict as you can imagine, but those energy markets we're watching closely and I would say that we can't predict if they are going to be any worse or any better. But my prediction if I was going to give one on this is a slight up-tick in that business down there to stabilize would give our customers the confidence to go back and start spending again on some of those categories that we believe right now from the survey work we've done, and they're sitting back, holding their money. They are not releasing those funds right now because they are nervous. Once they can settle down I do think we'll start to see some movement back, yes. Dan Wewer : And just one real quick question. A year ago we were discussing some of the weaker first year sales volumes in Arizona and in Utah. Now we're talking about the strength in the Western markets. Are we seeing those stores that opened up at slower revenues, are they achieving that faster same store sales growth now that they are in their second year? Tony Crudele : Dan, this is Tony. When we look at the comps and sort of the store maturation cycle, we've always said that the newer stores are going to ramp at a higher pace than the chain. When in good times and the chain is moving out at your 3 to 5 comp, you know, we're going to be at a delta above that. We're seeing that the stores out West are running above that normalized delta. But given that, obviously, the rest of the chain is very flat, obviously that helps to increase the delta between the mature stores and the new stores out there. But what I would tell you is that, yes, some of the stores that came out slow are ramping at a much nicer pace. We're very pleased with those stores, and that's why when we look at the new store productivity and we spent a great deal of time looking at it, we look at it more on a rolling 12. We know that some of the stores last year that we talked about came out a little bit soft. So we know that we probably have this lower new store productivity over the course of the year. But when we look at it and look at it over a 12 \u2013 rolling 12, it's relatively consistent for the last four quarters. It has gone down slightly. Some of the West stores have come out slower. That's probably one of the bigger drivers and some of the West stores also had a little bit more square footage as we've had some additional square footage so that we could have more allocation for the feed products since they tend to be strong feed stores. So that distorts the calculation a little as well. But IRR hurdle has not changed. We're meeting pro forma. And so we feel very good about the new stores, especially as we see the stores out West ramp. Operator : Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good evening, everyone. Just to let you know, the Cleveland Indians are up three nothing. Greg Sandfort : Oh, man. Chuck Cerankosky : Somebody mentioned earlier your taking \u2013 about taking your data warehouse, my words, in house and starting to manage that. How does that work as you start to roll out the loyalty card? And I assume they are connected? Greg Sandfort : Yes, they are connected. I mean, we brought the database in house, it was last month. And what we're going to be able to do now is mine it with our own folks rather than outsourcing it to a third-party. So all the enrollments, all the customer data we have will be here and we'll be able to manage it accordingly. Chuck Cerankosky : And was there any problem connecting shopper data to the individuals to specific market baskets while it was done outside of the company or is that all dependent on the loyalty program? Greg Sandfort : Well, no, I mean, what the loyalty program will do is give us access to every single one of the purchases they make as they go into our stores. But whether it was outsourced before or whether it\u2019s in house we're not going to see any material difference in the data itself, it's just how we'll mine the data. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year. Greg Sandfort : Good luck to you, Chuck. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam Sindler : Yes, hi. Good afternoon, guys. Quick question on Petsense and more just about the timing of the announcement. It seems or if I remember correctly that this sort of thought process was that you have a bunch of stores in front you to open, and that is the main focus, you know, probably no acquisitions during that time frame. Petsense is obviously very small, but again it does seem like a different customer based on what you\u2019re saying about your learning\u2019s from HomeTown Pet. So now in a difficult macro environment, you sort of have to try and manage two related, but different businesses. And related to questions about maybe where we are on the broader picture, what should we be thinking about the timing of this announcement, why now, I guess, is sort of the general question? Greg Sandfort : Adam, this is Greg. Two things to remember on Petsense, one is it is not going to be a distraction for TSC, and it will not really look to take any type of funding and resources from TSC. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s a well run little company. It is small in base today, but has tremendous growth opportunity, and it will basically fund itself. So don\u2019t worry about trying to run two businesses. They are not going to be integrated. It\u2019s a separate business. It runs separately. It has its own president and its own staff of people, and there would be no integration, this was a strategic buy and not an integration buy, there is the difference. Adam Sindler : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Our final question comes from Joseph Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Cristina Fernandez : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Cristina Fernandez for Joe. We wanted to ask about the incentive compensation. You talked about $0.07 to $0.08 headwind being a normalized compensation for next year, but then at the same time EPS coming in below that mid teens range, so how do you reconcile the two? Tony Crudele : Well, Cristina, this is Tony. What we\u2019re saying is that our incentive compensation is based against our plan. So as we move into 2017 and we create a new plan, we have to allocate to the incentive compensation expense line relative to our projected 2017 plan. So as we go through this year with very limited incentive compensation in the expense structure, once we recalibrate next year and put a new plan together, we need to put an on plan incentive compensation. So we estimate that if we move back relative year-over-year that there would be an increase in the expense structure of $0.07 to $0.08 to the bottom line. So having said that, we're just saying, I'm just giving you notice that you need to adjust your models accordingly as a lot of people have been looking at this year's expense run rate and applying it to next year. So you just need to be able to add in some incentive compensation into your model next year if you have not already. Cristina Fernandez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Greg Sandfort for closing comments. Greg Sandfort : Well, thank you, everyone, and thank you for your continued support in Tractor Supply. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in January regarding our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

On the call with me today are Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller and soon to be Chief Financial Officer, as Tony plans to retire in early March of this year. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results. It was obviously a challenging retail environment, and our team at Tractor Supply managed the business well and drove both the top and the bottom line. We focused on driving our sales in several of our key categories and kept our inventories balanced across the entire company. On a market-by-market basis, we aligned our businesses from all sides using merchandising, pricing promotion and inventory. We spent considerable time last year managing the business around weather trends and geographical pockets of both strength and weakness. While we never have all of the answers, through careful planning and execution, we successfully drove growth in the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales increased 3.1%, and were positive across every region. Strength in sales came from everyday basic items across a number of consumable, usable and edible categories and hardline-related categories such as livestock and pet, bird, trailers and accessories, hand tools and livestock equipment, to mention a few. These are the types of products that our customers buy based upon need and seasonal change. They are the core of our business at Tractor Supply. And as indicated on our last earnings call, we believed we could drive these areas of our business in the fourth quarter with the right planning and execution. Throughout the quarter, the team worked diligently to further localize assortments, manage the flow of inventory and improve the speed of replenishment to our stores. In over 100 Deep South stores, we maintained a spring-summer assortment of lawn and garden products to address year-round consumer demand. In our northern-based stores, due to the extended warm weather, we adjusted assortments early in the quarter to capture sales in warm weather products, while pacing the delivery of cold weather products. Our vendor base and supply chain were cued to react. And as the weather turned cooler in December, we were able to flow additional winter-related products to our stores to capture sales. We did a lot of listening to both our field team members and our customers in the back half of last year. We know our customers want more access to shop for the products they need. And as a result, we increased the number of products online through our drop ship program and expanded our Buy Online Pickup in Store Program in the latter half of the year. We also know that many of our customers want to interact with Tractor Supply on a more personalized level. Thus, we accelerated the rollout of our Neighbor's Club program. Customers continue to be eager to sign up for the program, and enrollment rates continue to exceed our forecast. As more customers sign on to the program, we have seen an increase in our attribution, click-through and redemption rates. The program was live in over 600 stores at year-end, and we plan to complete the rollout across the chain in the second quarter of 2017. We increased staffing in stores in an effort to improve customer service and sales conversion. In categories such as gifts, toys, footwear and apparel where we saw challenges in sales early in the quarter, we kept a watchful eye on inventory and where necessary, acted appropriately to clear excess inventory to ensure we were well transitioned at year-end. Looking forward, we remain confident and committed to driving bottom line growth through a balanced approach of managing sales, margins, and our operating expenses. We have a number of new products and category resets in the stores for the first half of the year. And from a systems and technology standpoint, we continue to execute on our digital priorities to provide the merchandising, customer facing and logistics capabilities needed to support our growth. With our long-term logistics infrastructure in place now, we will begin construction of our new distribution center in the Northeast later this year and we'll expand our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska as well. Now with respect to Petsense, the management team has plans to grow the store base by 25 to 30 stores in 2017. I just returned from the Petsense national stores sales manager meetings, where I met many of the Petsense store managers and gained a deeper appreciation of their localized customer focus. I must share with you how excited I continue to be about their opportunities for growth. Petsense has a proven store growth model, and with the addition of a digital component at some point, this will only broaden the offerings for the small town pet customer. Tractor Supply is currently sharing best practices with Petsense, and we look forward to continued growth in their business. In January of this year, we did convert our two original HomeTown Pet stores and they are now part of the Petsense operation. 2016 was certainly a more challenging year for our company. But we are not standing still, waiting for the business climate to improve. Instead, we are taking proactive measures to move our business forward, managing those things we can control and continuing to invest in our future growth. We are a growth company and will continue to be a growth company. We have a solid core business that is focused on a dedicated lifestyle customer who depends upon us for the products they need to live their lifestyle. Over the longer term, our priorities will continue to be focused on our people and their development, enhancing our merchandise offerings, and adding digital capabilities to meet the ever evolving demands of our customers, while always maintaining our goal of returning value to our shareholders through sustainable growth. As I wrap up, I want to thank the more than 24,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication, and the level of service they provide to our customers. A big goo rah to everyone in our stores, our Merchandise Innovation Center, our distribution facilities and our Store Support Center. All of you have contributed to making Tractor Supply the great company it is today. And as previously announced, our CFO Tony Crudele, will be retiring in March, making this his last earnings call. Tony has been a tremendous partner to me. And he played an integral role in Tractor Supply's growth and success over the past 11 years. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Tony for his leadership, his dedication, his stewardship of our culture, his friendship and his many contributions to Tractor Supply. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Tony one last time for a more detailed commentary on our fourth quarter financial results. Then, Kurt Barton, our incoming CFO, will take us through our initial outlook for 2017. Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to take a minute to thank Greg for allowing me to be part of the best team in retail as well as thank all of our dedicated team members that are truly the heart and soul of Tractor Supply and have made the past 11 years the best of my career. We will be completing the transition at the end of February, so hopefully I will see many of you before then. But I wanted to thank the investment community and our many analysts that have supported the company and me over the years. Your insights and professionalism have made us a better company, and I'm very fortunate to have had the opportunity to interact with all of you. Now back to business at hand. For the quarter, ended December 31, 2016, on a consolidated year-over-year basis comparable store sales increased 3.1%. Net sales increased 16.4%, to $1.92 billion. Net income increased 10.6% to $123.6 million, and EPS increased 14.6% to $0.94 per diluted share. Demand for our core everyday basic items remained steady throughout the quarter. However, demand was limited for winter-related products during the months of October and November due to a warm start to the quarter combined with an unseasonably warm winter last year, which limited early season urgency. When cold weather arrived, the consumer responded positively and we saw a lift in seasonal sales. As a result, sales were the strongest in the month of December, as cold weather drove sales of winter seasonal merchandise such as heating fuel, insulated outerwear and power equipment. We managed the warmer than normal months of October and November by taking advantage of an extended summer selling season, most significantly in parts of the Southeast and Texas, where we maintained a full assortment of summer-related products in response to continued customer demand for seasonal products. As Greg mentioned, we experienced strong demand for many of our basic everyday items in both hardline-related areas and C.U.E. such as livestock and pet category, which generated mid-single-digit comparable chain-wide sales. These benefits were partially offset by softness in categories such as safes, footwear, gift and decor. Comparable store sales were positive across all regions. The strongest performance was in the Southeast and West. The performance of the Southeast region was broad-based and also benefited from the sale of emergency response products related to Hurricane Matthew. We continue to see strength in the Western region, as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share. Comp transaction count increased for the 35th consecutive quarter, gaining 4% on top of a 0.6% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by continued strength of our C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food as well as heating consumables. Average comp ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points compared to last year's decline of 190 basis points. Deflation and big ticket sales decline were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease. Deflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 60 basis points, driven principally by livestock feed, bird feed and lubricant categories. Comparable sales of big ticket items were down low-single digits year-over-year. Because of the warm start to the quarter, sales of cold weather-related big ticket products such as log splitters and stoves were down. These are items that tend to be purchased earlier in the season and can be influenced by the weather. As a reminder, the fourth quarter included an extra sales week as part of the company's 53-week calendar in 2016. The 53rd week also included one additional comparable store sales day in the quarter. We estimate that that additional comp day added approximately 60 basis points to same-store sales in the fourth quarter. The additional week represented 6.2 percentage points of the overall 16.4% sales increase for the quarter and provided an estimated $0.055 benefit to diluted earnings per share. Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales as those stores will fall into the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 35 basis points to 33.7% compared to no change in the prior year. The merchandise team continue to proactively manage both sales and gross margin during a challenging sales environment. We were sharper on price to drive traffic and create value for the consumer. In certain holiday and discretionary products, we accelerated markdowns earlier to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position. The mix of merchandise negatively impacted gross margin by an estimated 13 basis points. This was driven by the strong sales in C.U.E. products specifically animal and pet food, bird feed and heating fuel which are below chain average margin categories along with softness in higher margin categories such as footwear, gifts and decor. Freight was generally flat the prior year. Lower diesel prices along with lower import costs were offset by higher inbound transportation costs and a greater mix of freight intensive categories. For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was flat as a percent of sales to 23.6%. SG&A was impacted by several factors. We benefited from strong expense control from our cost saving programs along with leverage from the solid comparable store sales growth. We are very pleased with our expense management during the quarter which resulted in leverage of store occupancy, medical and related payroll cost, as well as other store and Store Support Center costs. We continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit initiative resulting in lower utility and related maintenance costs. As part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience, we allocated more payroll hours to our stores and invested in additional marketing throughout the quarter. And, therefore, we experienced deleverage in both of these expense categories. Additionally, the impact of consolidating the Petsense operations along with onetime charge related to the acquisition of Petsense resulted in an incremental 40 basis points to SG&A in the quarter. Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in the fourth quarter. Total consolidated SG&A expense grew 16.5% from the prior year. We estimate the 53rd week added approximately 5.9% to the year-over-year SG&A growth for the quarter. Exclusive of the 53rd week, the onetime acquisition and integration cost of about $2.4 million and the Petsense SG&A expenses, SG&A grew only 6.7% over the prior year. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 36% compared to 35.4% last year. The increase in the rate is principally due to timing of federal and state tax credits in the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $53.9 million and $274 million outstanding debt compared to cash balance of $63.8 million and $150 million outstanding debt at the end of last year. During the fourth quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.7 million shares for $116 million. Also during the fourth quarter, we acquired Petsense for $145.7 million, funded through cash-on-hand and revolver debt. Average inventory levels per store for Tractor Supply stores decreased 2.9%. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into 2017. Capital expenditures for the year were $226 million compared to $236.5 million last year. We opened up 21 stores and closed one Del's store in the fourth quarter. For the year, we opened 113 stores and closed six Del's stores. The decrease in capital expenditures relates to cycling of the construction of our Southwest distribution center last year, offset in part by a greater mix of retrofit locations for new stores which generally require renovation capital and incremental capital to fund our LED lighting retrofit project. So, now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt to discuss our initial outlook for 2017. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. We expect consolidated full year sales to range from $7.22 billion to $7.29 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 2% and 3%. We are estimating EBIT margin to decline by 25 basis points to 40 basis points. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $445 million to $457 million, or $3.44 to $3.52 per diluted share. We expect to open approximately 100 new Tractor Supply stores with around 45% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We will continue the transition of our Del's stores and we expect to close nine Del's stores as we execute our Tractor Supply Western expansion plan. We expect to open approximately 25 to 30 Petsense stores which includes the conversion of the two HomeTown Pet stores to Petsense. All sales from Petsense will be included in non-comp sales through the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, we forecast that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%. Our adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock options exercises is estimated to have approximately 50 basis points favorable impact on the effective tax rate in 2017 and will more than offset the headwind of cycling the benefit from federal and state tax credits in 2016. We are initially targeting capital expenditures of $270 million to $290 million in 2017. The increase over 2016 results principally from the initial development of our Northeast distribution center, which is targeted to begin construction in second quarter of 2017 and expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018, with capital allocated over that time. Other key initiatives that we have identified for 2017 include expansion of our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, an upgrade to our warehouse management system, completion of the LED lighting retrofit for the remaining 700 stores and further enhancements to build out our digital and omni-channel capabilities. We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrowed position at the end of each quarter and target the year-end debt position to range between $400 million and $450 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the $10 million range in fiscal 2017. For modeling purposes, we estimate that diluted shares outstanding inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity will be between 129.5 million to 130 million for the full year. Now, let me discuss some of the assumptions that helped us form our projections for 2017. Our toughest sales comparison in 2017 will be in Q1, as we have both a strong start to 2016 in January with extreme cold, followed by an early start to spring with a warmer than normal March. As a reminder, we believe last year's first quarter sales benefited from some pull-forward of spring sales. As we have emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halves, not the quarters. As different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales between quarters, particularly the first and second quarters. Last year deflation increased slightly and averaged approximately 40 basis points. This year we expect deflation to moderate but continue to be a headwind ranging between 10 basis points to 30 basis points with it moderating in the back half of the year. Due to the calendar shift, as well as the timing of Easter, the second quarter and the full year 2017 will have one less comp sales day compared to 2016. We estimate that the extra comp sales day contributed approximately 60 basis points to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 15 basis points to the full year. Let me also refer you to the 2016 comparable store sales table on the last page of our earnings release as this provides a bridge to the adjustment for the week shift in the calendar. We are targeting a net 25 basis point to 30 basis point increase in consolidated gross margin for the full year. We would expect improvements in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, including price management, continued strong markdown and inventory management, strategic sourcing and exclusive brands. We expect those benefits to be partially offset by the following items. Freight expense is expected to be a headwind of approximately 10 basis points this year with anticipation of higher diesel prices and import shipping costs. We are also estimating deleverage of 10 basis points from the mix of merchandise, principally from the growth in animal and pet food. With respect to Petsense, as they produce a higher gross margin rate than Tractor Supply stores, we anticipate a slight favorable impact of approximately 10 basis points. In terms of gross margin performance by quarter, we forecast a year-over-year improvement in each of the quarters. With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 60 basis points to 80 basis points this year. Factors to consider are, in 2016 we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation year-over-year. As our incentive program is based on performance to plan, we would expect that a more normalized incentive compensation for this year would have about 20 basis point impact on SG&A. Allocated over the last nine months of the year, as the first quarter of 2016 performance was strong and had a more normalized incentive cost. We expect payroll and related payroll expenses to delever as we commit to strong customer service levels in our stores, along with cycling favorable medical costs in the prior year. Depreciation expense is expected to grow double-digits over the prior year and will delever, resulting from the LED lighting retrofit program, and technology related investments, with shorter average lives. This year is a 52-week year, thus, fourth quarter will have one last week relative to 2016. In 2016, the additional leverage gained from the 53rd week benefited SG&A in the fourth quarter by approximately 10 basis points and approximately $0.055 per diluted share. In 2017, we will incur some exit costs to close nine Del's stores principally in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that Petsense will have a 20 basis point to 25 basis point unfavorable impact on SG&A due to their high growth model with less mature stores. With respect to SG&A by quarter, we do not anticipate any of the quarters to leverage. We believe the first quarter will be the least challenging comparison as it had a more normalized incentive compensation. As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period in each quarterly conference call. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : We'll take our first question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray : Hey, thanks a lot everyone. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about the demand trends during the quarter and I was particularly interested in if you saw any inflection or change before and after the election. And also if there was any change in demand outside of weather. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Peter, this is Greg. We did not really see any significant movement before or after the election. So I would tell you, no, not much change there. But we did have the favorability of weather as it broke in the latter part of November and December. That did help the business, no question, brought customers in to purchase heating products, cold weather products and alike. A little soft in the first part of the quarter, very strong in the latter part of the quarter. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thank you. And then I assume there's no change. But last quarter there was discussion around both the energy markets and ag markets, which each I believe are about 10% of your store base. Maybe could you comment on those for the fourth quarter and how you anticipate those trending in 2017? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, first of all, the ag markets are somewhat incidental. I think, as we saw the weather change, we would say that more of the impact was weather than it was things happening in the ag markets. Secondly, in Texas and in the energy markets, we saw a slight recovery but nothing that was that significant yet. We'd like to hope that it will continue to improve, but it was very slight. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck this year. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: You're welcome. Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a follow up on that last question, as you think about the cadence for 2017 \u2013 and you guys gave a lot of color, so I appreciate that but I'm not sure if you could comment on how Q1 has started off specifically. But if we assume Q1 comps are lower, it would imply the rest of the year gets back to that high end of the historical range of 3% to 5%. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, what have you sort of embedded in here as the drivers of that improvement? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey Seth, this is Kurt. First, I'll point you to the comparable sales table just to kind of recognize the shift in the comps. Q1 was strong last year, and it is a tough comparison. But as we look at the \u2013 our assumptions for the year, we look at first and second half, both of the halves falling within the sales range that we gave you. So we anticipate some balance between Q1 and Q2, again, with the second half falling within the range also that we provided for 2017. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Got it. And then a separate topic on some of the payroll investments that you made in the fourth quarter and are expecting to make in 2017. Could you elaborate on those changes, and what prompted you to go down this path? Clearly, service has always been a strong point here, but just curious what's changing on that front? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth, this is Greg. What I would tell you is that we were listening to our customers and our team members. And we track our customer service scores very closely, and we noticed in the early part of the year our scores were not as healthy as we would have liked. And John Ortis (30:55) and I \u2013 John runs all of our storage organization, sat down and we said we're going to protect payroll in the fourth quarter. We're going to make sure that payroll is protected. And we believe that that was also part of the sales improvement that we had. Team members on the floor able to assist customers and give that traditional legendary service that we always talk about. So it was a conscious decision. I believe it paid off well and as we're looking at payroll for 2017, we will look to make similar adjustments as we go through the year. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Does it at all change how you guys think about the ability to get leverage going forward, what type of comp needed? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well that's always taken into consideration. And the plan, the payroll plan is we believe the way we've got it laid out for 2017 is more than adequate to play back to what we've got planned quarter by quarter in our sales comps. But if we start to see an acceleration of sales, John and I have agreed, we're going to start adding more payroll. And if we see sales retract a bit, we're going to hold payroll because we don't believe that taking payroll out of the stores and affecting the things that are closest to the customer can pay any big benefit. We'll take cost out someplace else in the company. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Go ahead, please. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats Tony. We'll certainly miss you, but \u2013 and welcome Kurt. Steve, could you talk maybe a little bit about the first half resets. I think Greg mentioned some things that were on top from a merchandising perspective. What can we expect to see and what do you think are going to be the biggest drivers this year in terms of merchandising? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes, good question. I mean this is one of the things that's really helped fuel our growth in the past and it's really a point of differentiation for us. I'd frame it up in a couple of ways here. First I would talk about new products. And when you talk about new products, we've got two or three events that are planned for the center court that are going to be fairly significant. Things in the Garden event, and our Chick Days event as well as what we're doing with outdoor sports will add hundreds of new items to this treasure hunt experience that our customers have come to rely on us for. In addition to that, I would tell you that one of the key resets that we'll be looking at and we're executing it right now on our stores, is our stores aren't getting any bigger. That said, using our air rights is something that we're going to take advantage of. We've got 1,000 stores today that are executing a program on the right side of our store mainly in a key area of our business that being pet and in some of the C.U.E. areas. And we are going to take the beams from 72 inches up to 84 inches, which will give us between 20 linear feet and 24 linear feet to bring in new products and to help fuel the continued growth that we're seeing in that side of our business. And then the last thing I would tell you is that, we're a company and you've heard us say this in the past that believes in test and learn. I'm going to change it to test and roll, not to confuse you here, but we've tested a number of programs and we're rolling a bunch of these programs out to more stores. Give you three quick examples. Carhartt, we are expanding our assortments and the look of the layouts in a couple hundred stores. We will be expanding a hay program and forge program into another couple of hundred stores. And we're seeing success in the stores that have brought in the new Muck shops, which is premium rubber footwear. And those vignettes will be going into a couple hundred stores. That's just a few to name. There's plenty more on the docket, but I would tell you that we're excited about the changes that are going to be happening inside of the box. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just somewhat related, a little bit on private label where it's already north of 30% here. But where do you think you can lean further into that and how does that play into your thinking about how your merchandise online and kind of keep this business a little more insulated from some online risk of disremediation there. Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: It's a great point. So we're very fortunate that 10 years or so ago we started really focusing on what we call exclusive brands. And we have seen nice growth there, and I will tell you, 4Health, which is our store brand for pet food, continues to take market share we believe and continues to grow which keeps us somewhat insulated. This coming year you'll see an expansion of that program. Originally it started off with basic ingredients then we went to grain free. And now we're going to be adding a line that's really targeted nutrition, supporting our customers that own cats and dogs that might have needs that are around sensitive skin, sensitive stomach, weight management, things that we weren't able to support before with our own exclusive brands. Another great example would be our DuMOR line of livestock feed. Last year we upgraded the nutrition around our equine segment. And we're going to be rolling out organic chicken food within our own line of exclusive brand this coming year. And then the last one I would note and I like to give you all examples so they're somewhat tangible, is that we're taking what we had in electric fencing and converting that entire aisle to a control brand, which we'll roll into an exclusive brand. We'll be the only ones who have it. It'll be called American FarmWorks. And that reset is taking place, as we now speak. So a lot of exciting things on the exclusive brand front. Not only will they help differentiate us, keep us a little more insulated, they also come with a little better margin and value to the consumer. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Terrific. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Congratulations, Tony. I'll see you in February, but figured last call. Just first follow-up on the cadence. I think Seth asked this earlier. Kurt, you mentioned that you think the halves actually may be I thought pretty similar. There is a tough compare in Q1. I guess some were thinking it could be negative. I know you're not guiding specifically. I don't think you were trying to imply that it wouldn't be, but that it would just even out. And then thinking about the fourth quarter, I think, you're encouraging us to look at the adjustments in the release, meaning the fourth quarter compare actually is a little tougher based on the adjustments. And then can you tell us, within that, is Petsense very material to Q4 comp, meaning how much should it add by next year's fourth quarter? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Starting with the first question on the first half and first quarter, yes, I would say that we're not indicating that Q1 is that strong of a headwind. It is a challenge to us. And I would encourage you to look at it as a half between Q1 and Q2 and that there could be some challenges. Just, I'll \u2013 March is the one month that is the biggest month that is impactful for Q1. And I would say that for Q1 we'd expect it to be below our target range that we stated of 2% to 3%. In fourth quarter, we do recognize that it does have a strong comp. We're also considering, as Greg mentioned, that we did see a soft October-November with the warm weather. So for a number of reasons, we still see strength in our opportunities in Q4 in the back half. Petsense, not material. And I would say comping them, which would be only the fourth quarter where they would introduce as a comp, would not be a significant factor. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up \u2013 this is a question, I think, asked of Greg earlier, and I'll put it in this way. I don't know if the answer is going to be any different. But if we look at the spread in performance between, let's say, the healthier and the impacted markets, whatever the causes of those impacted markets, it sounds like the business improved maybe because some of the healthier markets got stronger but not necessarily the weaker markets stabilized or got better. I don't know if that's fair, if you can just clarify please? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Simeon, it's Greg. I would tell you that it was very similar. I wouldn't categorize that the markets that were healthy were healthier and the markets that were difficult were more difficult. We saw a little bit of a bottoming effect, I guess, earlier in maybe the third and fourth quarter. We started to see a little improvement in the energy markets. But in general, the rest of the markets were performing similarly honestly from quarter to quarter. So the big culprit was what we talked about. You had energy markets that had an impact. Most people continue to forget about deflation, but deflation is a serious component when it comes to a lot of the products that we sell. When we're selling a bag of bird seed a year ago at $20 a bag, and this year it's at $14. That's tough to offset. We did have a little bit of drag, I would say, with weather early, but that came back in December. So not a lot of movement, Simeon, really not a lot of movement. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS. Go ahead please. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good evening. Thanks a lot (40:52) for taking my question. And it's kind of simple. Is 2% to 3% the right long run comp growth to think about for the business now? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Michael, this is Kurt. We're giving guidance for 2017. And as we've seen the trends and the headwinds we had in 2016, we have explained the challenges that we see for 2017. We're not giving more guidance necessarily for years beyond 2017. We still see us as a growth company and a lot of opportunity. So in regards to beyond 2017, we still feel confident with the target ranges that we've given for Tractor Supply. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And my second question is, Greg, you mentioned some increased promotions in the fourth quarter, some increased labor and some favorable weather. So to what extent did your internal initiatives drive the comp? And to what extent was it the external environment that drove the comp? Again, this is just in an effort to try and understand what the long... Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Great question, Mike. But one thing I can tell you is we didn't buy comps. Comps came because of the fact that we have the right products and we were able to react to the business as that weather broke. And I would tell you that the promotional cadence was slightly more, but nothing extreme. And you know us, we don't believe in buying sales. We like to run a good steady business. And we reacted when we saw some soft performance in some categories, see the (42:38) team reacted and started either being a little bit more aggressive in those categories or taking some earlier markdowns to make sure that we came out of the season clean. But other than that, it wasn't anything heroic that we did. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Go ahead, please. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Greg, I wanted to talk about the decision to slow the rate of new store openings from 113 in this last year to 100 in 2017. And I guess you'll have more flexibility to adjust the store openings the following year, but thinking what is the right annual number let's say after 2017? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good question, Dan. We had said a few years ago that the ultimate number would be 120-ish, if we could find all the locations, get all of the leases secured and we had enough people in the pipeline to be able to fill that. And we have tried year after year and the best we could come was I think about 116 a few years ago and then we started dropping back into that 107 to 113, 114 number. We think the 100 number is the bottom and we said, listen, at least 100 stores, we know we can open those. And it gives us a little bit of room because in some categories when you look at certain parts of the country, for example the Northeast. One of the reasons that we are building that new distribution center is because there's continued growth opportunities there but we can't get to those until we can service those. No different than what's happening in the West. We could not get to some of those opportunities until we opened Casa Grande. So that's probably more of the factor than anything else. And I'll also tell you, I don't know of another retailer that's opening 100 stores a year right now. The number kind of settled there at 100, but it'll be 100, maybe a few more than 100 depending upon when we can find the locations and of course getting that new distribution center open in the Northeast is going to be key for us. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up, looking at the operating margin rate forecasted to drop a bit in 2017, do you think that we've seen operating margin having peaked? This is meteoric increase the last seven years, and I know you're forecasting gross margin rates to grow. But are you at the point now where you believe it's probably best to reinvest savings back into the business to grow share rather than trying to grow operating margin rate? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Dan, it's a great question about balance. We always talk about the business, balancing sales, margin and how we handle inventories. I don't think that we are at the peak of our operating margin. I think that we've seen some headwinds in the last year to 18 months. As we clear through those headwinds, I think, we'll have more confidence in saying, beyond that point, are we of that number or is there still a little bit more room for growth. But I think we're optimistic there's still some more room for growth. We know some of the efficiencies that we have yet to gain inside the company, whether it be through supply chain, be it through how we're running our business with technology. And I think we need a little bit more time, as we get through this curve of headwinds, before I think we would give you any affirmative answer as to we think operating margin has either leveled off or there could be any more growth. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Do you think capital expenditures are peaking this year at $280 million, $290 million, and then after the DCs are completed that drops or is this the new norm? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. I think that number could come down a little bit over time. I think it's a healthy number this year. We've not been \u2013 we have not hit the number we forecasted over the last several years. There's lots of things that come into play with capital, as you know, as you get into the scenario of spending for either building a building or retrofitting installing (46:54) new lighting and such. But, no, I think we're in the range, and we'll be there for at least the next year or two. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good evening. So I just wanted to understand the comp day in the fourth quarter lapping that 60 basis points versus the second quarter. So, as we look at that table, which clearly lays out a shift making 1Q look a lot less daunting, but as you think about the second quarter, are we losing 100 basis points, 120 basis points, because you're lapping a Sunday as Easter hops into the second quarter? And then do we have to take the 60 basis points out, as we lap in the fourth quarter as well? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Chris, there's a number of variables in that calculation, as to the timing of Easter and the volume in second quarter. We mentioned the 60 basis points impact in the fourth quarter as a point of reference to the value of the day. And our calculation would tell you that the value for the lost day in the second quarter is similar. So you will have that one headwind of 60 basis points in the second quarter. But there's a number of variables in regards to what day and what impact we get to the day subsequent to Easter after that. So best reference is 60 basis point impact on that day for the quarter. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, is there an actual 60 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter or is that just \u2013 that was 2016 and that's gone? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Right. That's 2016, and that's gone. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Understood. And then, my follow-up question is, Greg you talked about sort of ag markets being, I guess, very small relative to your prior perception. So could you expand on that? How are you thinking about ag markets as a headwind as you face 2017 and in retrospect do you think ag markets was worth any discussion at all, frankly? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Frankly, I think we \u2013 it's not worth a discussion. As we've learned more, it was more of a weather effect than it was anything else. I think we need to focus our efforts around what's happening in energy markets. And then, as I said in my comments, maneuvering around some of the weather, I'll call it, conditions and things that we can only affect through reaction. We can't plan for that. I can't plan whether there will or won't be cold weather. I can't plan if it'll be warm or cold or rain or whatever. So I think that's the part of our company that sometimes, I think, people forget how nimble we are and how we can with our logistics and distribution network today really manage our inventories well, move inventory around as it's coming into the system, and take advantage of being able to react fast and move sales. But I think I'd like to focus on the things that I think are more challenging and that's the energy markets and then just how we manage weather. And then I'm not going to let any of you forget about deflation. Deflation is a factor. And it's somewhat flat, I guess, to maybe slightly up as we go into this year. But it was a factor of what, I think, about 40 basis points last year. So these are things we deal with. These are sometimes things that we don't talk about, but I'm convinced that we've got a good handle on the business, and the ag market thing is not worth really talking about. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : I want to start with your relationship with Revionics. When you consider the current consumer spending environment, has your view of the company's relationship with Revionics changed, maybe as it relates to the importance of the different modules? I know you spoke in the past about price being most important but you clearly mentioned promotional activity within the release, so can you just kind of update us on where you are with the relationship and how you view it over the next few years here? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Steven, this is Steve. I would tell you that we've got a solid relationship with the folks at Revionics. As a matter of fact, we renewed our contract, it was a year ago. Today we're using two of their promotional tools or their pricing tools that being basic price op as well as clearance. As we move forward, we'll be doing more due diligence around what promotional optimization looks like, what their tool looks like and others. But right now we're not at a point of making that decision. But we do recognize it's out there and that is something we'll be talking about for the future. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And then, as a follow up, as it relates to the balance sheet, I mean I sit here and think about just how important you are to your suppliers and then look at the 35% to 40% payable to inventory ratio. And I would imagine that this ratio is much higher within the C.U.E. categories and I guess lower within the more discretionary categories. Is that fair and then how do you think about it as an opportunity, if it is one, over the next few years? And if you can touch on it, how big of an opportunity may it be? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Yes. That's a fair assessment. And we saw some improvement in the finance inventory this quarter. But I would say there was just a few small favorable impacts there. We are focused on it. We will be focused on it. We've got a number of things to address in that category. But that is an area over the next couple of years, I think, we can make some movement. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Steven, the other thing I would mention \u2013 this is Steve, just to kind of cap that as well. I mean, there's a variety of tools that we work with our vendors, and there's gives and takes. This is certainly one of the negotiables along with many others. I would tell you that where we've been able to make headway with our vendors may not necessarily be on this one line. If you look at the last year or so, our sales \u2013 top line sales hasn't been that strong. We had carried some inventory over a year ago. It is something that's on the docket to look at. But again, it goes back to a give and take and what do we want to really work with our vendors on to drive for the future. So I appreciate you bringing it up. It is in the consideration set, and we will look at it. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And we go next to Matthew McClintock with Barclays. Go ahead, please. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. And, Tony, best wishes to you. Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was wondering if we could talk about ticket for a second. Greg, you talked a little bit about the deflationary aspect on your business. But as I think broader, bigger picture, what's it going to take to get return ticket back to positive maybe accelerating \u2013 an accelerating trend? And is that more just having a recovery in the energy markets, the ag markets or is that more maybe having some inflation in some of your core inputs? Thanks. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Matthew this is Steve. There's a difference between big ticket and average ticket. And if you talk about the bigger ticket products that we've got in our stores, we've had some headwinds over the last several years. And one of those headwinds that we've publicly stated is safes. That business has been declining for us, and so we're kind of fighting an uphill battle in that category as well as a few others. What I can tell you is I don't believe it's the fact that the customer is still willing to spend if given the right opportunity and the right product. And then if you look at our business, the last three of the last four quarters we've seen a decline in big ticket. Now, that said, we are not giving up on big ticket and in talking with the team, we are resetting this coming year our commercial zero-turn mowers, which is under the Bad Boy brand. And we believe there's going to be some life in that business for us as we move forward. In addition to that, they've got a $6,000 unit and today it's been successful in a couple hundred of our stores and we're going to expand it into more stores. We're looking at testing Kawasaki engines in OPE in a couple markets to see, again, if customer is willing to spend if given a reason to do so. We're making traction in UTVs and you're going to see us rollout an $8,000 UTV to more stores, not the chain because we recognize there is some local needs here. And then the last one I'd leave you with, is because I do think it goes back to who and what we're about, and that is the trailer business for us is a good business. And customers have relied on us as a destination for that category. In this coming year, we are going to be testing a dual axle trailer, again with a retail of $2,000 in about 100 of our stores. So my point there is that, while we've seen some softness in big ticket, some of it could be oil, some of it could safes. We're not giving up on it. And we do believe there's a market there. We just got to give the customers a reason to buy from us. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : And we go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey, Brian. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I wanted to focus back on the fourth quarter. We talked, had a lot of questions already on this, but can you give us maybe a better example on how much stronger December was than the first two months period as the weather turned? And then the second question I have on that is, and this is more qualitative I assume that, as the weather turned, and we maybe got this first wave of what maybe a more normal weather in a while, did the consumer react as you would expect or was there still \u2013 did you still see indications of maybe some hesitation as the consumer \u2013 as the weather turned? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Brian, this is Greg. I'll talk to consumer reaction here. Yes, December was the stronger of the three months in the quarter. No question. As the weather became more normalized, the consumer came back into the store spending in the categories that we would traditionally find them spending in \u2013 cold weather products, heating products, heating fuels and so on and so forth. We felt there was pent-up demand. And we found that clearly there was, and December proved that to be the case. So more normalized, I'm not sure what normal might be anymore because there's been so much fluctuation. But it was a good indication that our consumers were willing to spend with us and traffic our stores when that need or that demand was created. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: And, Brian, this is Kurt. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: (58:09) follow-up... Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Brian, I was just going to reiterate that as we said December was the strongest and October-November weakest. And the comp sales were weakest in the beginning of the quarter, strongest in December. And that's about the detail we can give you on that. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then maybe a follow-up, Greg. During the (58:30) prepared comments, you talk a lot about \u2013 what I heard \u2013 I think I heard you say is that Tractor Supply did a much better job of being nimble around this weather and almost like localizing stores. How much different was that effort this year than it had been in prior years? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, I think, we've been working this for a number of years. And I think Steve would tell you that there's never \u2013 and we haven't had two years the same in some time. I was making this comment earlier that it used to be we could pretty much pinpoint when fall would start, winter would start, spring would start, summer would start. Now the seasons continue to lap over and move around and such. And so we had to have a supply chain that was more nimble. So is it unusual the last year? I'd say, warm weather goods sold in the South and cold weather goods sold in the North. I mean, we've been able to work our assortments around that over time. And I think we've learned that the consumer is going to be driven by demand. So if it's warm outside, there's going to be certain demand for certain products. If it's cooler and colder, demand for other products. We're able to do that and address that today far better than we could in the past. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot, guys, for tons of detail. A lot of it's been answered and helpful. But I guess I just wanted to confirm. It sounds like you're reiterating that you feel comfortable with the mid-teens EPS guide long-term or a target. Is that the intention? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, here's what I'm going to tell you. I think on a longer-term approach \u2013 we know that in the shorter term, due to some factors, we're going to be a little bit challenged to get back to that 3% to 5% comp and mid-teens EPS. But I do believe, with all the things that we're doing as a company and the things that we're seeing from our customer, we're still finding positive transaction counts. We're opening 100-plus stores on the TSC side, 30-some-odd stores on the Petsense side. We're expanding our digital footprint and then adding more and more capabilities there and that particular online business is growing exponentially to what we're seeing in the four wall. Mix of products. Steve talked about all the things that he's doing to renew the product mix and that's what drives our business. Neighbor's Club, bringing in the new CRM program. And also I could go on and on about all of the things that we're doing to enhance, improve and drive the business. So it is our belief that for the longer-term we should be able to get back to those 3% to 5% comps. And if it's not mid-teen EPS it's going to be at least double-digit EPS. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Understood. And just thinking about Petsense, I know you guys have framed it as relatively immaterial. Like, what is in the guide in terms of like EPS from Petsense? Is that something we should be modeling in or thinking about? And then if I could just sneak one in, I mean, the loyalty program sounds pretty exciting. If you could tell us how different traffic trends may be were in some of those markets versus the ones that have yet to get the program, that would be helpful too. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Stephen, it's Kurt. Petsense, net of the margin and the SG&A impact that we mentioned in our assumptions, I would say bottom line, they are not material to net income. They will not impact either favorably or unfavorably operating income. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: And Stephen, I would tell you, on the loyalty program or Neighbor's Club as we call it, again, it's still fairly confined. We just rolled out another couple hundred stores. So we're up to 600 stores now total. A couple of tidbits that I will share with you and that is, membership rate is growing. As Greg said, it's exceeding our expectation. Here, very shortly, we will exceed 1 million members to the program. I thought I would share that with you all. That'll be our first milestone on route to many more millions. The exciting thing about the program is that 80% of the folks that are signed up for the program, they are new to our email database. So you can only imagine the amount of communication now that we're able to do, that we didn't have prior to before. Greg talked about the click-throughs and the redemption rates and everything else being higher, and it really giving us an opportunity to personalize our communication. What I will say is, is until we scale and we cycle a full year, traffic count and some of the other metrics we're a little hesitant to go too much detail there, because I don't know if some of that's weather, because we're doing this geographically, or not. And so, rather than trying to confuse matters, I would just ask that that you understand that we wouldn't be rolling it out if we didn't think there was a lot of opportunity in front of us. So I'll leave you with that. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure. All right. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just wanted to make sure, I know, we spent a lot on the kind of the long term outlook algorithms, so just really a housekeeping item. Are you guys going to update your thoughts on the long term ranges at the Analyst Day? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Scott, this is Kurt. We'll certainly address our long-term outlook at Analyst Day. At this point I expect to provide more details and reaffirm what our expectations are for 2017, and then give some short-term plans as well as what we expect it takes to get to those long-term target range. So at this point, we are not changing, but reaffirming our long-term guidance. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. But it will be a topic of discussion at the Analyst Day? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. Then my second question is, in regards to overlap with your merchandising online, what do you think the percentage of what you guys sell is available online, and then where do you think your price vis-\u00e0-vis online with whatever's available? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Scott this is Steve. We spend a lot of time looking at what's happening out there in the digital space, and we're not so na\u00efve as if you read any of the headlines to realize that there's intrusion of online in a lot of brick-and-mortar. That said, we have done a few things here to do our best to insulate ourselves and we think that the model itself is somewhat unique. One, it's the customers that we cater to. Two, it's the stuff we have inside the box such as big bag feed, things that are very difficult to ship that last mile where there's not a lot of margin in it. And Tractor Supply plays in a lot of that space. A third of our business is also in exclusive brands, and it's one of the things we've worked really hard at just to develop those brands, so our customers know they can only come to us to get it. Now, there are alike products, I think with any brick-and-mortar that you're going to find online. So a shirt's a shirt and you can buy a shirt, depends on what you want and what brand you want and what you're willing to pay for it. In terms of pricing, I would say that we're relatively competitive. And we're not seeing any erosion in the categories that I would be the most concerned with in terms of driving C.U.E. products. And we've talked about that at the opening here. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. That's it for me, and then obviously congratulations to both Tony and Kurt. See you guys... Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Scott. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : ...on the 21st. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Incorporated. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah thanks, good afternoon. Steve, you had alluded to some of the additions you guys are making in your private label in the feed category on DuMOR and 4Health. I'm curious as you look at the broader livestock and pet category as a percentage of sales, where do you think we are in that timeline of penetration on the overall business? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: It's an interesting question. I've been fortunate enough to be with the company for \u2013 this is my 19th year, and I think we've probably been asked that question for 17 of the 19 and it's the last 17, we've been asked. Every year I go back to this. I do believe there's still long-term potential for us. For a couple of reasons : one, we are a consolidator in the markets that we go into and the markets that we serve. And talking to a lot of our key suppliers that are in the livestock feed business, they would tell you that there's a lot of generational transfer happening right now, and that we continue to pick up market share in the markets we serve. And I think that's one thing that makes us very unique. I would also tell you that we don't own 100% of the market in things like pet food or pet supplies. As a matter of fact, we own a very small portion of the overall total that's being sold out there right now. So I still believe there's upside and opportunity there. And as we continue to expand and grow our 4Health business and it becomes a bigger and bigger portion of our overall total, it continues to insulate us and adds value to those folks, quite frankly, that live the azure (01:07:50) lifestyle. So I still see upside and I still see momentum. Those are just two of the categories and there's plenty of other C.U.E. categories that do make us very unique that we are continuing to drive share in. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: That's great. And then, Greg, I think in your opening comments you made some commentary on the drop ship program, extending additional products to that program, Buy Online Pickup in Store, could you just provide a little bit of even if it's anecdotal, some of the progress that you're seeing in those initiatives? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, I'll take that one. This is Steve again. I would tell you that we're looking at the digital space as a real opportunity for Tractor. I know there's a lot of folks out there that are trying to find defense to what's happening. And I would tell you, there's good reason for many of them, including Tractor to be constantly looking over our shoulder and building our own business. We've made great strides, I think, in the digital space over the last couple of years, but we still have more opportunity and more momentum. In terms of things like Buy Online and Pickup in Store, we rolled that out last fall. And we are now in 900 stores, and I would tell you that we had no national marketing. The only marketing we've done is on our website and in the inside of our stores. And our customers have responded very favorably. And they're using this now, this tool, and I think that it sets us apart from a lot of other farm and ranch chains. And we continue to see that as a growth opportunity. And by mid next year or mid this year, I should say, we will have that fully functional, chain-wide. And we'll be able to really do a blast nationally. The other thing I would tell you is that our customers use our site for a variety of reasons, and our web visits this last year were up 20%, which is exciting. And the other exciting thing is our store locator activity was up over 20%. So not only are customers finding us through the site, but there are actually many new customers using that store locator to come into our brick-and-mortar space. Our sales online continue to grow. While they're still less than 1% of our sales, we're very encouraged with the growth rate that we're seeing. We doubled the amount of drop ship vendors we had from year over year. We've got 75,000 plus SKUs now that you have access to online compared to about 15,000 to 20,000 inside the store. And what's also exciting is about half of our sales online are from products that you can't find in one of our stores. So we see that as a growth opportunity for incremental comp store sales as we continue to expand that out. So that's kind of an overview and an update, and I would tell you that our customers are responding very favorably to what we have to offer them. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks so much and best of luck. Operator : We'll go next to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, everyone. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey, Chuck. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi, Chuck. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : In looking at the item you mentioned about acquisition costs in the fourth quarter, is that worth breaking out? Can you give us what that was? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Chuck, I think, Tony mentioned that in his script at for the fourth quarter it's about $2.5 million pre-tax in there. There was other costs that were absorbed prior to the fourth quarter, but that was your Q4 impact. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Great. Now, switching to store openings, Greg, you mentioned that sometimes it's just difficult to get the number of people to man the stores when they open. Do you have that same problem or anticipate it, as the Petsense stores open? And is this going to be an ongoing sharing of the ability to get a full complement of Tractor Supply stores opened alongside of the Petsense units? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Chuck, I think, you misunderstood me. We do not have a problem finding capable people and training them to get the stores open. So my apologies, if you misheard that. What I said was that we could open up to 120 Tractor Supplys because we have a pipeline of people to do that. I'd also tell you that in the Petsense side of the business, now that I've spent some time with Steve Neibergall and the team, they also have a fairly robust, I'll call it, supply chain of people in the works. Petsense is a much smaller staffed store than Tractor Supply. So it's not as demanding on finding the number of heads of people, but no different than Tractor Supply. They are being very careful and making sure that they put qualified, well-trained store managers into those stores, as they ramp their growth. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you on that. Steve, what are some of the outdoor sports SKUs you might be expanding into this year? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Great comment. We expanded our ammo program in Q4 to up to 200 stores now, and we're still trying to get a good read on it. I say that because we had some in stock issues during the third quarter on that program. So it's hard to get a good measurement on it. I can tell you, even though we had some challenges there, we still think that there is a potential there for further expansion. Anything that has to do with kayaks, fishing kayaks, unique differentiated kayaks. Things around deer feeding and watching, all those categories seem to be performing very well for us. Now that said, there are some categories in the program today haven't performed and we'll be continuing to cull those out. I think we've got three or four different outdoor sports tests going on right now across the country to try to find which tests seem to make the most sense for us as we move forward. And we're going to watch it very closely and continue to evolve and refine that program as we move forward. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you. So with respect at your expansion of 100 stores in 2017, I was wondering if relative as you look to the expansion in the West, is there a disproportionate number of the 100 new stores in 2017 coming in the West compared to where we were in 2016. And if that is the case, is that having any effect as to why your EBIT margins will delever by 25 basis points to 40 basis points? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Alan, the answer is no. It's a very well-balanced portfolio of stores across. The only reason we had a little bit of disproportionate openings in the West a few years ago was to get that distribution center up, and we needed about 125 stores minimum. And now that that was completed, no, it's a good, balanced mix across. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. And my follow-up, if I may Greg, so it appears if you look at your trends over the last couple of years that your store is in the oil patch community came back quicker. There was less of a lag period from when oil has rebounded versus when oil was sinking and you kind of held in there with your comps better. What would be your best guess as to why that anomaly is apparently so? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well there's a number of things that happened in the oil patch. It's not just the fact that people are working or not working, there's also other things that affect this consumer that lives this lifestyle. For example, most of them have a large animal. Some of them have cattle. Things like that that get affected when their loss of income or lowered income comes into play, and so, they seem to either sell off the cattle and they'll have less need for certain products that we sell them, or the fact that they had certain projects they were going to do like a large fencing project, and that didn't materialize because guess what, didn't have the extra cash. So my comment on that is, I can't say that they bounced back any faster. I would say that it's been very slow so far from what we're seeing in the energy markets. And we just have to kind of wait and see. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay, thank you very much. Tony, best of luck to you in the future. Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : Next to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot, and good evening. My question is around ticket versus traffic in 2017. I apologize if I had missed any comments here, but when you look at the comp guidance of 2% to 3%, how much of that is traffic versus ticket? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Steve. I'll start. I would tell you that if you looked over the last several years, what's driven our comps is more traffic than it has been ticket. And while we're making an effort to try to gain the other side of the ledger of the ticket side, as I mentioned earlier, more sales around some of the bigger than average ticket, I would still tell you that traffic has been one of those things that Tractor Supply's been very fortunate with. And that's if you look at the C.U.E. categories, the strategy around a lot of that that's what's driven it. So if you're asking me and I was laying out what next year would look like, I would say, I'd lean on traffic more than I would on ticket. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it, but overall, thinking about it, you had a little bit less deflation forecasted, and I assume you're thinking big ticket won't be as big a drag. So does that suggest that you could see a positive contribution to comp ticket in 2017? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: That would be fantastic. If you could make that happen for us, I would support that. I would be uncomfortable telling you, I think, that that's what would happen just based on what the history has done. It's not that we've given up on ticket or average ticket, there is still some headwind there. But I will tell you that I feel traffic is one of the things that we continue to see. And I think a lot of what we're doing with Neighbor's Club and Buy Online Pickup in Store is continuing to drive that. So, again, I wouldn't give up on ticket or average ticket, and if it happens, fantastic, we are going to put a strategy around driving it. But I still would lean more toward the traffic side of the ledger. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks and my follow up is just around marketing. Can you talk about your marketing mix, how that shifted and any significant changes that you're planning for 2017? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: In Q4, one of the things that we've really been transitioning to is taking what has been traditional marketing and moving it into the digital space. We still recognize that our customers use newspapers, and they still view things the old way so to speak. So we've been slow to transition, but we are transitioning. In Q4 specifically, we did increase distribution in a couple of our circulars, and I think Greg had mentioned slightly more promotional but what we were able to do was get more of exposure out there for the circulars that we did do. As you look into 2017, I think, you'll continue to see an evolution of where we're putting our marketing dollars. We'll be spending more of those dollars on things that are more digital. We will be taking advantage of our Neighbor's Club program, as we continue to scale that out and talking to our consumers. And we'll continue to evolve based on what they're wanting from us, and we can measure that through the response rates in a lot of what we do. So we've always said the customer drives where we go. And in this case, we are going to get in the backseat and let them take us for a ride. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Very good. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck. Operator : Our final question comes from Adam Sindler from Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Very good. Thank you so much. Tony, my congratulations as well, enjoy the time off. Greg, I'm really glad you brought up the deflation point because I do think that is important. And I wanted to go back maybe to some discussion around deflation coming out of 2015 as long ago as that was. I think back then we were seeing some waning deflation mostly in seed and lubricants. Steel was becoming less of an impact. And then we started to see better trends into this year, and then things turned pretty sharply in the third quarter. What was it specifically that turned negatively and sort of against maybe expectations? And then what should we maybe be looking for going forward to see if we could ever get back to an inflationary environment? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, one of the biggest things was two things \u2013 the oil category going one direction and seed or bird going in another direction. Both categories where we sell tremendous amount of tonnage of product. What can change that, as we go forward, we always like to have a little bit of inflation pushing our sales. And a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the business. Unfortunately, it's been a mixed bag. And again we have to deal with that. We have to manage through that. Adam, it's not been easy. But I'd like to see a little inflation this next year maybe as we get toward the end of the year into 2018, but I can't predict that. Right now, it looks a little bit like we're still going to see some deflation for a while. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, in that regard, does the mix of private label impact that at all or is this just deflation sort of on a pure product cost? I mean, my example, I guess, would be private label is \u2013 not always in your case specifically but often more lower priced. As you mix more to private label, is that impacting deflation or is that just more on the comp ticket? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: I think Steve can answer that. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. I would say that when we talk private label, we talk private label across all the brands that we have in our stores. So some of them are related to more commodity-based products and some of them aren't. So I want to make that point clear first. I would tell you that if you look at the drivers of deflation or inflation, like you said, it's steel, it's corn, and it's lubricating or petroleum-based products. But we keep a close eye on all of those. As we grow some of our exclusive brands and take share, it's a balance and it's a mix. So I don't necessarily think that it's a deflation necessarily driven solely from that, and that's what I would leave you with. I don't know if I confused you more or not. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that's perfect. One follow-up on the average ticket question. As you look to the back half of this year, the average ticket was down on down from the year before and close to down 3 points on the fourth quarter on a two-year stack. I mean, I understand for the year you're probably not going to get positive ticket. But would you expect that by that fourth quarter ticket starts to turn positive especially with sort of the expectation of waning deflation by the fourth quarter? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, again, there's the difference between big ticket and the big ticket impact on average ticket. And so, the two of them play together. The only thing I can tell you about big ticket is that things like log splitters and stoves and some heating products, we didn't see much benefit from in October and November. There was a pretty significant headwind there. As it got colder, we started to sell more of that type of product. As you look to next year, again, I don't want to say that it's all weather-driven, we are doing a lot of things within the assortments that we have ourselves, but there is a factor there. So if you look year-to-year, you're right, we've had two Q4s that showed big ticket off than average ticket. We're doing everything in our end to try to keep that number up. But, again, customers are going to buy what they need. And we've always said we're a needs-based retailer. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to your speakers. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Thank you everyone for your continued support and interest in Tractor Supply. And we look forward to speaking with you again in April regarding our first quarter of 2017 performance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Steve Barbarick, our President, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Chief Financial Officer. As was previously disclosed in our business update on April 11, a challenging weather played a significant role in our first quarter results, with a very mild January and February and cooler spring temperatures throughout most of March accompanied by March winter storms. The demand for both winter and spring seasonal products was clearly diminished for the quarter. In the markets where weather and sales were more favorable, we pulled forward several spring seasonal receipts, and where weather was less favorable, we acted aggressively addressing excessive winter product, which by quarter end resulted in a clean transition to spring. In April, the weather has turned more spring-like and our consumers are responding positively to our assortments and sales have improved. We know from our many years of experience, the spring sales can shift between the first quarter and second quarters and that is why we have consistently stated that our financial performance can be best accurately assessed, by the halves and not by the individual quarter's business. Looking ahead, we understand that the retail landscape is changing rapidly, and our customers' expectations are evolving as well. Having the right products in stock at the right time and having those products competitively priced and readily available, whether in-store or online is what our customers expect. The shopping experience across all Tractor Supply shopping channels must be seamless, effortless and consistent. And by adding a level of exceptional customer service, we can meet their needs better than any of our competition. With this, evolving landscape in mind, we are making strategic investments throughout the organization to meet the ever-evolving expectations of our customer and further enhance our personal relationship with them. Here are a few of the strategic initiatives that we will believe will enable us to address the current challenges we face within our business and will be instrumental in driving comparable store sales in the future. The first is our customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club. This was rolled out to all stores as of early April and has 1.5 million members to-date. This program is growing rapidly and has exceeded our original expectations. We are very excited about this program and believe it will become a valuable tool to strengthen that relationship with our customers. Now, we've got a complete picture of the customer shopping history, and that will allow Tractor Supply to gain deeper insights into our customers buying habits and provide us with the ability for more targeted messaging to them. As we leverage our digital communications, we will better inform our customers regarding new products or upcoming events that are of interest to them. While we are still gathering data for the entire chain of stores, initial results from the pilot stores have shown that our Neighbor's Club members shop our stores twice as often as Neighbor's Club non-members, and their average spend is notably higher than non-Neighbor's Club members. The second initiative; we're very excited about and have seen great initial customer response for, is our Buy Online Pickup in Store Program. This program is currently rolling out to the entire chain and will be complete by mid-May. We know our customers value, a number of things, high-quality products, product availability, a quick and easy shopping experience and most of all, great customer service. The Buy Online Pickup in Store Program allows our customers great flexibility and added convenience as they shop with Tractor Supply. They can place an order online, be assured the product is there at the store and pick up that order the same day. And while they are there on our store receive seasoned advice on other products and services that we offer. They no longer have to wait for package to arrive at their home and they don't have the hassle of shipping something back should they need to return it. Our stores are very close to where they live and we'll gladly take the return. Since the rollout, a significant amount of our e-commerce business growth can be attributed to Buy Online Pickup in Store, and we are founding that these transactions carry a higher average order value and many customers are adding purchases to their cart when picking up their online orders in our stores. And finally, with our supply chain, our largest initiative this year is the construction of our new distribution center in the State of New York, which is expected to be completed by the middle of 2018 and shipping products by the end of 2018. This new distribution center will add the necessary capacity for further store expansion in the Northeast Corridor and will also support our expanding digital fulfillment strategy and move us closer to our goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population within 2 shipping days. So, in summary, we know our business performance has been a bit choppy over the past year and we know that the retail environment is rapidly evolving. We have a plan and we are executing to that plan to realize our long-term target of high single-digit annual sales growth. Some of the tailwinds to the business over the past several years, such as the C.U.E. expansion, some of the big ticket sales, some of the benefit of the oil and gas markets and the impacts of inflation have either slowed or become headwinds today. We know it's our responsibility to address those shifts and find ways to move the business forward. We have a strong and proven business model that serves a unique customer with specific needs. With our size, scale, store count and growing digital capabilities, we believe there is no other farm store retailer that can serve this customer the way we can. We are confident, we are investing in the areas that will drive sustainable long-term growth, but we cannot guarantee that this growth will always be on a smooth and linear path. We will, however, continue to be as transparent as possible about our business and will keep you updated on our initiatives and their progress. As always I want to thank all of our dedicated Tractor Supply team members who give great customer service every day to all our customers and the other frontline of our business. A big thank you to everyone for all you do in our stores, Merchandise Innovation Center, distribution facilities, and our Store Support Center. I still believe you are the best team in retail. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt Barton, who will take you through the first quarter results in more detail. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended April 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $1.56 billion, resulting in net income of $60.3 million and earnings per share of $0.46 per diluted share. Comparable store sales decreased 2.2% versus a reported increase of 4.9% last year. As a reminder, our Q1 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's comparable store sales increase would have been 2.6%. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we anticipated Q1 to be a challenging sales quarter. If you recall the first quarter last year benefited from very cold weather in January, which drove the sale of winter related items. Q1 of last year also benefited from both warm March temperatures and an early Easter, which drove sales of early spring merchandise. Unfortunately, we experienced a complete opposite situation in first quarter 2017. In this year's first quarter, January and February weather was very warm, and we then had cooler temperatures and snow in March. January and February's warmer than normal conditions of this year impacted demand for winter seasonal products. Additionally, the March winter storms, which primarily hit the Midwest and Northeast, but also reached down into parts of the Southern regions quickly silenced any early demand for spring seasonal products. The impact on comp sales from softness in seasonal products was relatively equal between winter and spring seasonal goods. Sales were weakest in the Northern regions of the country where the impact of weather was most pronounced, both in winter and spring seasonal products. The Southern regions were less impacted by the weather conditions, but we're cycling a tough compare from last year's strong performance. The difference in comp sales performance between the Northern and Southern regions, excluding the Western region was approximately 600 basis points. The Western region which experienced less weather volatility had a solid mid single-digit comp sales growth. We continue to see strength in the Western region as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share. We continue to experience increased demand for many of our basic everyday items, such as our livestock and pet category, which generated low single-digit comparable chain-wide sales. Excluding the impact of certain weather influenced categories, such as bird feeding, animal health and fencing, we continue to be pleased with the overall performance of this category. While there is a seasonal component to the livestock and pet category, we were pleased with the continued increase in comp units and sales dollars in the pet food and animal feed categories. And we see no evidence that we are losing market share in this core area of the business. Comp transaction count decreased 1.4% compared to a reported 4.2% increase last year or 2.6% in the prior year adjusted for the week shift. The growth in many of our C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food was more than offset by the lack of demand in winter seasonal products such as heating units and insulated outerwear and spring seasonal products such as lawn and garden, animal health and ag chemicals. The average ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points. Big ticket sales declined and deflation were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items were down high single-digits year-over-year. The comparable sales decline of big ticket items was primarily driven by a slower start to spring seasonal products such as riding lawn mowers, 3-point equipment and trailers, as well as continued softness in the safe business. Deflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 50 basis points, driven principally by heating fuel, bird feed, livestock feed and lubricant categories. As Greg stated, the weather shifted to more typical spring conditions in early April. And as a result, we have seen consumer demand increase. Also as a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those will fall into the store base, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 60 basis points to 33.1%, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the prior year. In certain cold weather seasonal products where there was limited demand, we increased markdowns to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position. Additionally, we were slightly more promotional in our efforts to drive sales by creating value for our customer. Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight intensive categories, growth in our e-commerce business and to a lesser extent, higher average fuel costs. The mix of merchandise had a slightly negative impact on gross margin. This was driven by the strength of sales in C.U.E. product, specifically animal and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. Petsense provided a benefit to gross margin as they produced a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores. Also, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter margin benefited approximately 15 basis points from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC. For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% of sales in the prior year's quarter. The primary driver of the deleverage was the decline in comparable store sales. A few other factors impacting SG&A ratio were Petsense, which operates at a higher SG&A rate and a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience. And then as a partial offset to the deleverage, we estimate that incentive compensation provided approximately 35 basis points of year-over-year leverage. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 36.8% last year. The reduction in rate is principally due to the favorable impact of the adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises. The impact is typically strongest in the first quarter due to the timing of equity vesting and a smaller income base in Q1. And thus, we do not expect similar benefit in future quarters. We continue to estimate our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $75 million and $250 million outstanding debt last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.6 million shares for $115 million. The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 3.4% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense average inventory levels per store increased 4.2%, principally due to the timing of our spring seasonal build and to some extent, the timing of seasonal sales. With respect to our outlook, we are not updating our guidance at this time, as we have said for many years, we know that weather can impact the timing of sales this time of the year and we believe it's best to evaluate our performance based on the halves rather than the quarters. While our Q1 performance was disappointing, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring summer season, therefore we believe, it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you Our first question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll use my one on some of the online stuff. Thanks for some of the color on BOPIS. Any more metrics around kind of just how online sales \u2013 I know it's a small number for your guys, but how it's been growing, what percentage of the business it is? And then what else are you working on beyond Buy Online Pickup in Store, those types of things in order to better position the company for omnichannel selling in the years ahead? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Peter, this is Steve Barbarick. And I would tell you, we've made a lot of advancements over the last couple of years and we continue to make traction as we go forward. To give you some bullets into the quarter and what we saw, our web visits were up about 26%. And what's also very exciting is that, if you look at the number of hits we've got the store locator, we had nearly 5 million hits to store locator for the quarter, which is up about 40%. So we know our customers are going online, they're not just looking at content or looking to buy, but also to look where our stores are located. Couple of other tit bits here that I would share with you. Our mobile traffic was over 60% and up to last year, and we continue to see Drop Ship as a real viable source for us. If you combine what we've done now direct-to-customer, as well as what we're seeing with Buy Online Pickup in Store, the early results, I will tell you, as we move into the back half of this year, I suspect for the full year we will be between probably 1% and 2% of sales, so we're seeing nice growth there. Then if you look at some of what we're doing in terms of capabilities, as Greg said, evolve to what customers needs, we talk a lot internally, and I think, we introduced this to you all at the Investor Meeting this concept of ONETractor. And it's really making sure we're taking the care of the customer anytime, anywhere and anyway. And we're working on things like enhanced search, enhanced checkout. We've got a comprehensive pricing tool that's going on out there for us, we can look at what the competitors are doing, even going as far as taking a look at what we're doing inside the stores to better take care of our customers, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. So there is a lot of things and a lot of capabilities that we have that we're working on and that also includes what we call the stockyard, which is a special order system in a number of our stores right now. So I guess, what I would tell you is that we're not sitting back, we're moving forward and we've got a plan to do just that. I know that was a long answer, but I wanted to make sure that I was comprehensive as I could be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, I'll focus a little bit on the weather and ask the question \u2013 two part question. The first one is the West Coast mid-single digit comp pretty outstanding. I know that that region has been out-comping the rest of the store base for a while now. Can you just kind of remind us the spread between how the West has been performing versus the rest of the chain? And then, as the weather did improve, did all product categories improve in line with how you would expect, meaning do you see any area, Steve, specifically a weakness from a merchandising perspective that maybe you could do better in? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: This is Greg. I'll start off and I think Kurt and Steve may join. First of all, the Western region, as you know, we had a little bit of a slow start there in one state, but once the consumer recognized and understood who we were, we started seeing business accelerate. We don't typically comment on the basis points difference between West, East, North and South, so I'll kind of pun on that one. What I can tell you is that the West is doing quite well. I think there has been a real challenge in the retail environment in general, but our Western stores are performing very, very well. Now, there is more new stores in the West so \u2013 and I needed to make sure that you understand that caveat. I think they're less weather dependent as well, so that gives us a little bit of a benefit, and there's some things we're learning about the West, not only through the digital capabilities that we're also rolling out there, but how this consumer \u2013 their consumption, it's a large recline community. And I think for us, it's a little bit like the Deep South in Texas. We've got a consumer base out there that needs us, wants us to be there and they're engaging with us at a very high level. So, you'll see us continue to expand in the West eventually maybe talking about more distribution capability toward maybe the Seattle area at some point. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. And I would just add Matt that talking about the seasonal shift here, Greg talked earlier and so did Kurt about the softness we saw in January and February, and that really impacted a lot of our cold weather businesses. It was exciting and we thought we get into early spring and so we were quite nimble, we brought some receipts in early, and thought that we could capitalize on an early spring season similar to last year, but then the weather turned on us. Once we got into April, you would get, basically what you would expect. We saw the OPE lines start to ramp-up, a lot of our spring seasonal businesses take off, as well including grass seed. Now, we do have one less day in the second quarter, and that already took place in April. But if you look across the board, it's pretty much shaping up like you would expect for a spring season. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And Steve also kind of follow-up on that question with two parts. When you talk about April looking like a typical spring season, does that also imply it's back in that range plus 2% to plus 3%, that you're guiding for fiscal year 2017 or is it just an improvement from the minus 2% that we had in the first quarter? And then the other question, I want to see if you could answer, is on the original gross margin guidance of 25 basis points to 40 basis points for this year. I knew that the pricing optimization was part of the other margin driver that you're expecting. Do you think it's still a good environment to be pushing higher pricing in submarkets given the tepid demand? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Dan, this will be a two part answer, because I'll take a piece and Steve will take a piece. On the April trend moving forward, the only thing I can tell you is you said it, not me, yes we are in the range of where we forecasted for the year. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: And we're pleased with the initial response, but it's early. We are only 2.5 weeks in, but as we said before when you see what is shift, it can have a dramatic impact on some of these categories in our business. Steve, you want to talk about gross margin? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. I would just say that, Dan, we always talk about rate and share and there is a balance between the two. We are certainly not going to do anything that would put us in a position to be uncompetitive. So when you use a pricing tool and you've got upwards of 15,000 SKUs in the store, not all of them have the same level of elasticity. So we're going through \u2013 we're going to be very careful, very surgical in the way we use the tool. I would say at this point the tool is not cost us any share, if anything it's benefited us both ways, because we have come down on some prices and up on others and we will be very methodical on the use of that. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Petsense in terms of, is it meeting expectations, could you carve out what its sales might be approximately for the quarter? And then where in New York will that new distribution center be and when might it open? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Well, that was about five questions and one there, Chuck. So I'll start off with Petsense. Very pleased with how the Petsense business is performing. As I said 2017 is a year of kind of the shakedown to understand the business more fully and to look at the expansion opportunities. So, we still think this is a company that has tremendous store count, as well as online and Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities, which we'll talk more about as we get further into the year. But Petsense is a winner, we're very excited about it and it's teaching us a few things about pet special that we can use also in Tractor. What else? Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : DC. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: DCs. DC is going to be, I think we've already made that announcement... Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Official, it's in Herkimer, New York. Frankfurt \u2013 Herkimer it's in that area, it's in that area, it's kind of a small town in Northern part of New York \u2013 but Northwestern New York. But the location was chosen because of its importance to helping us broaden our expansion capabilities as we add more stores into North. As you may know, and we talked about this a few calls back that we needed more capacity in the Northeast. The Hagerstown facilities and there are two of them are somewhat running at maximum. That facility will be fully functional at the end of 2018. So, don't expect us to \u2013 we'll start adding some stores in 2018 there, but 2018 into 2019 will be the final build outs as we move forward on for store base there. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Any numbers you could give us on what Petsense contributed to sales in the first quarter? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: We don't really break it out separately, and honestly Chuck, we don't do that for competitive reasons. So, as it grows to be a larger percentage, we'll talk more about that maybe later in the year first to next. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray : Greg, I was wondering if you could comment, in the press release and in your prepared remarks, you referenced multiple times that retail landscape is changing rapidly. Could you provide maybe a little bit more perspective on that with the specifics and I assume it may be related to e-comm, but maybe you can enhance the detail? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. A couple of things that I would say to that, Peter, one is that we noticed in our own business about four years ago \u2013 four-and-a-half years ago, the amount of consumers that were coming to us through mobile devices, and we kept scratching our heads, on why is mobile so important. Well, as we talked about as a group and we went out with visiting stores, it's very simple. The landscape change, because that's the way our customer in the real community can communicate with us and that's how they really find product online. We see there's not a lot of broadband in a lot of these markets where we have stores. So, cell towers are easy and for them to use mobile was important, so we quickly started to mobilize everything that we do. The second thing we were learning is Buy Online Pickup in Store made a lot of sense to us as step one, versus that fulfillment, which we're already doing to Drop Ship and such through our Franklin facility and with a lot of vendor base that we have out there. But we said, our customers buy projects generally and they come in, they want to know that the product is there before they make the trip. Remember, they're traveling on average of 10 miles to 15 miles to get to our stores usually. So when we turned it on, we thought let's just watch and see and exactly what we thought was going to happen has happened and that was last fall, well I'm proud to say we've got to roll the entire chain in less than an eight-month period and it is driving our online business. It's also bringing customers in to four wall. And as I said in my comments, these customers are adding other things to the ticket. So, the ticket is starting to grow when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. And then, eventually we'll start to look at how we fulfill directly to consumers, as Steve and the team build out the network with the distribution centers, and we can start shipping direct, and not having to trying to fulfill out of one center. Now, the other thing that's changing in retail is you have to be available to the customer 24/7. It doesn't matter what time you open and close the physical store. The store is opened 24/7, and we realized that about four years ago, maybe even longer, and we've been working, and that's why we did to the replatforming, and I'm very excited about now our capabilities. And Rob's team has really brought us in very, very quickly and up to speed, and we're moving much, much faster than those in our segment. And having the capabilities of Buy Online Pickup in Store, direct fulfillment from a distribution centers and Drop Ship, being able to have mobile POS in our stores, we're testing right now, rolling out to more stores. What we like about that is, it gives us the ability to ring a sale to correct inventory, to answer a phone call, to do whatever, with one device throughout the entire store, it can even be a line buster, if we get a line of people, that can go in and use that device to basically ring the customers up. So, that's a wonderful tool, and the stores that are using it today are loving it. And I think we just about got a tool to the point, we're going to take it role to chain. And then the last thing is, the comment that Steve made about stockyard. And that's really the special order concept. It's really a kiosk that sits back at the customer service desk. It's a large screen, it's there for the customer. And what we're finding, customers are going there to place special orders, maybe large quantities of product that we already carry but, don't have enough in the store or a unique product that they can't find, but they can go on the screen with the help from one of our team members and we don't lose the sale. I'll give you an example. If we run an ad on Wednesday and Wednesday it breaks and Thursday, we sell out of an item, in the past, we'd have to tell a customer, we can give you a rain check, we don't have to do that any longer. Now we can say, listen just go to the kiosk, we'll go ahead and lock it in and that'll be coming to you in the next truck or will drop shipment to your premises. So all of these things are working in conjunction, and as Steve said before, it's ONETractor. So we've realized that, we have been moving very quickly over the last several years. We've probably just been more public with it over maybe the last six months to eight months. But we are clearly moving ahead of those in our segment and excited about what we see in front of us. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thanks. That's a great detail. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking the question. My question is around the promotional activity you discussed. Can you just elaborate on that, and whether you think, it was effective? And then the second part of the question, sort of ties in just around deflation, which has been a drag. Is that purely just flowing through the impact from lower input cost or is there any evidence that maybe it's getting a little bit more competitive in some of the consumable categories? Thanks. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. And one of the things, we talk a lot about is, I mentioned it earlier about our ability to be nimble, and whether it'd be using our inventory or using things like promotion to take care of our business and making sure that we continue to keep share up. In the first quarter, we did a few things. We did a coupon online to see what kind of impact that might have and we tested that across the network, and the response was very favorable with our customers. We also did a few other little events that we thought might have an impact. I would tell you that, it wasn't material in terms of overall sales to the business. It did have a little bit of a margin erosion, but we've always talked a little bit about the fact that, we've got to make sure that we're using all of the arrows in our quiver. This would be one of the arrows that we used in Q1. I don't anticipate further promotion needing to be used throughout the remainder of the year based on last year's promotion, but we want to make sure that we've reserved the right to use it, if we need to. So that's what I will would tell you about promotion. In terms of deflation and Kurt and I may tag team this one. Typically the way we view that is input cost first, and then what our retail selling price is second. So, what you hear when we talk about deflation isn't us just selling at lower retails, it has to do first and foremost with the impact of commodities. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. No, I will just say I agree, because Steve hit that important point, Seth in that, it's the input costs that are a key part to that. So, our deflation calculation is not quoting situations where there maybe retail declines without a cost change. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey, Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. So, I too have one question, but I'll make it part A and a part B. The part A, Greg I'd love to hear your thoughts on the private transaction in the Pets space last week, if \u2013 how you think about it, if you're expecting to see a more rational competitor, I'm not talking about the physical one, the digital one? And then my second question, and Greg, you mentioned there's been a lot of choppiness in the last year on comps, and the first quarter being no exception. We're kind of hearing from other retailers, we're hearing weather was a problem and then we're starting to see guidance that looks more normal for the second quarter. So given that the choppiness that you've seen, I guess, how do you get confidence in let's say, what a normalized run-rate looks like a 2%, 3% or 4%, and correct me if I'm wrong doesn't your comparison in this quarter you're in, doesn't it get tougher as the quarter goes on? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: All right. Let me first comment about \u2013 and let me not comment about the PetSmart Chewy scenario. All I can tell you there is that we keep our eyes and ears open to what's going on both online and in bricks-and-mortar. We think we have a powerful combination with Petsense and Tractor right now, and there is a lot of growth for us in Petsense to take that business digital and explode it. And in the local markets, where I can push from store delivery, it's going to be a huge advantage for us as we go forward. So, as far as the private transaction there, that's probably the only way that it could have happened, to be honest, because as a public company, I don't think that many people could have absorbed the hit in earnings. Moving on from that to the choppiness, and why do I feel, we've got a more normal looking setup for second quarter and maybe beyond, and yes, there's some challenges. Simeon, when you see the business respond as we had hoped in the early part of April that we didn't see happen in the first quarter, it gives us great confidence. We've been in this business, all of us, Steve's been here 19 years, I've been here 10 years, Kurt's been here 15-plus years, and the rest of the team, we're not rookies to this, we've seen this before. I can remember a year, when the weather didn't break until Memorial Day weekend, and we blew the numbers away for the entire year. It was just, we were off to the races and never looked back. So, I think we're a little less concerned now that we've seen the business open up, and it's more in line with what we had expected. But as I said before, this is not a linear path. We could see some coolness, some softness, but we really feel good about what we're seeing right now, and our inventory levels have really come down quickly because of the amount of sales that we generated in the first two-and-a-half weeks. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Simeon, Kurt. A couple things on that. So we continue to evaluate our long-term targets, and as just a reminder, our long-term targets that we've set is high single-digit total sales growth, which include some solid comp store sales in that picture. To Greg's point, one quarter of tough weather conditions or a couple of quarters there are not going to change our long-term targets. We still see the strength in the business, and our sales growth driving initiative ability to drive the high single-digit sales growth. One reminder is, when it comes to Q2, I think as was mentioned, in Q2, we do have one less comp sales day, that we know is part of the headwind that we're facing as part of Q2. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Recognizing that you don't want to update your full year guidance until the second quarter, to get to the low-end of the your previous 2% to 3% comp guidance for the year, you will need to do at least 3% comp for the next few quarters. And over the last four years, you've averaged an annual comp of 3.4% and you've acknowledged that this number benefited from the expansion of few big ticket sales, growth in energy markets and the impact of deflation. So aside from deflation getting less bad, what is going to get better in order for you to consistently put you in the comp range that's necessary in order to hit your standing guidance? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Michael. First as we said, given the seasonality of the business and the weather conditions in first quarter, we're not updating guidance at this time. Reminding that first quarter is the lowest volume sales and earnings quarter for that, that's the primary reason, it's about 15% of sales and earnings for the year. So at this point with being so early in the year and we recognize those factors that you brought up, at this point, it's just too early to give any guidance on the year. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Let me comment on, what needs to get better, Michael, okay. First of all, it's top-line sales, it's the categories that we didn't see response from in March this year that we saw in March last year, and we're seeing that. We also believe that the acceleration of our business in the digital space is feeding and fueling some of the things happening in the four wall store. We are talking with our consumer 24/7, they are interacting with us 24/7. As we learn, we reapply, Neighbor's Club has been a tremendous benefit from the standpoint of understanding this consumer better and being able to talk to them directly. And we're just getting really to start using some of that information. And then, I will tell you, we said it earlier, BOPIS has really been a wonderful addition to the business. What I like about is, it gives us both sides, it gives us the online component, it gives us the four wall component, and all we see for that is just continued acceleration. So there's a number of things, even within some product categories that Steve didn't mention, but he could, the things that we're starting to see work far better in some categories that maybe were a little more difficult the past two years, they're starting to open up again. And the energy markets down in Texas seemed to have settled down now and we're starting to see the movement back in those markets in sales. So, there is a lot of positive things that we see going forward, and that's why I would guess to say at this point, it's best to looking us at the halves not the quarters. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And Greg, if I could just add one quick one? Because of the addition of Petsense, we can't calculate your new store productivity, what was your new store productivity in the first quarter and how does that compare to what it was last year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Michael. I'll take that one. Yeah, there is a couple of unique factors in the new store productivity calculation I understand that, so I'll give you a little bit of data points on there. So the unique items are the week shift and the impact it has on this year, so the week shift into a higher spring sales week also long without Petsense impact the new store productivity when you're looking at it from the external data that you have. Internally, as we adjust it for those two items, the first quarter new store productivity was slightly below the prior quarter, but nothing significant in that decline and I'll just tell you that the new store performance continues to be in line with our pro forma calculations and those new stores continue to contribute at an elevated comp consistent as what we've seen in the prior year. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good afternoon. I guess maybe I wanted to focus on the GURA right, the service initiative you have going on, maybe if you just comment Greg on how that process is going, what metrics you're looking at to measure the impact on service levels and sales? And then how has the one quarter shortfall impacted your plans to invest in labor and service this year, if at all? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Couple of things, Steve, I'm going to talk about is GURA, and its greet, uncover, recommend and ask. Our scores are climbing in that category. I would take that if John Ordus was speaking he would tell you that there is still more work to be done, but we are seeing a comparison year-over-year in a very positive direction. The second thing I would tell you is that we're protecting payroll in our stores. We all believe, as a management team that you can't call out great service when you have no one in the store to wait on the customer and take care of their needs. And so, we are going to take the route of making sure the payroll is protected, and making sure our stores can service our customers and that could be painful at times, but we know that, that is the longer-term goal, is to keep that customer service level at an all time high. And our S&G scores, which is the company we used to measure that are very accurate today and are telling us that that is paying off. So we believe it'll payoff in sales, particularly as we get into the peak season here in second quarter. And you know what, we'll be able to update you more in July when we get through the second quarter. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I also wanted to ask a multipart question on the comp. I guess, part one would be sort of around the in store initiatives and whether there is any initial uplift when Neighbor's Club comes and whether the incremental self space and Pet is helping? And then part two would be sort of about, how to think about the deferred sales that you have to have from 1Q, do you think that comes in ratably throughout the quarter or is that more sort of an out of the gates types of a dynamic? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: So, let me start Stephen, this is Steve, with the in-store initiatives and some of the things that we're doing. We did reset about a 1,000 stores in first quarter, in those stores they got the reset, we went up to 84-inch height. And really, the strategic area of our business in that is Pet. And you heard Kurt, and I believe, Greg both talk about the growth of our Pet business in Q1. I think we're going to get the benefit of that later in the year, because that reset happened about midway toward the back half of Q1. So, that's still in play, but we anticipate continued growth there. We tested it before we did it, so we had an ROI before we laid it out. The other thing I would tell you in store is that we had our most successful Chick Days event ever when you crossover the March/April timeframe. It was fantastic. We saw great growth in a lot of the accessories within Chick Days, whether it'd be the coops organic feed and treats. The Garden event is doing exceptionally well right now. And so, a lot of the efforts that we put into the initiatives in store have really from where I sit have paid off. The seasonal business was a drag, and it's unfortunate because it doesn't necessarily reflect the hard work nor the results that I would have expected. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Stephen, Kurt, I'll address the second part of it. And it might be helpful as a data point to refer back to our pull forward discussion from last year. At the end our Q1, we estimated that number at about $18 million. And then, as we reported Q2 and saw the results in April more information settled we estimated at about $25 million. To have it more of a comparable number for this year, with the week shift in moving that week into Q1, but April shifting to Q2, our estimate is for this quarter, it was about a $15 million deferral into the second quarter. How that plays out in the second quarter, weather as well as Easter timing plays into it, so some of that there in the first part of April, but the rest of it really can play into just as the weather hits in various spots, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. So I wouldn't say it's something that was immediate all in the first few weeks of April, it really plays more into the weather conditions in areas such as the North. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then just Neighbor's Club, is there an early lift on that or is that really more about the long-term in the data that you're collecting? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Again, this is Steve. I would tell you that and I've said this previously that if we didn't think that there was a lift, we wouldn't have rolled it out completely. We haven't gone into specifics around what that lift looks like, but we do believe there is a benefit, less in the short-run, although there is a benefit and certainly more in the long haul. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I had a short-term oriented question and then a longer one. First in, and I think you said that April is off to a good start. If you took a step back and looked at April and March combined, are you in positive territory or are you still negative, if you're going to kind of look at it that way, trying to even out some of the Easter shift in the weather? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes, Scott. Good question. I can't speak too specific to \u2013 specifically to those particular months. We would just say again that, we saw the March potential dissipate with the cold weather. And then I would just tell you, we've seen strong response from the consumer as the weather has turned more typical in April. At this point, that's the best I can give you. Too early in the quarter to try to give more specifics. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Because Easter should have really helped you guys out quite a bit, isn't that correct? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, keep in mind that Easter, we're closed on that day. So, we lose a day of sales, but certainly last year, we had the benefit of the Friday and Saturday before the Easter and we had that in April, so you do get those two days in April. And we have a strong add at that time that coincides as well. So, there is a planned expected strong sales performance in that particular time around Easter. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : And were you on plan? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: It's a good question. Scott, can't be any more specific. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So, then I appreciate that. And then, so looking at a longer term question, I think it's something I've asked you guys before, but I want to kind of poke at it again. I mean, if I take a step back and just look at your same-store sales, yearly same-store sales, they really have been kind of down into the right since I think 2011. Each year, they're kind of peeling off just a little bit, and some years a little more, and I guess last year. What do you guys think is causing the kind of the slow decline? And obviously this year is not off to such a good start. I mean have you kind of pinpointed on what is a major drop from like I say mid-5% to now like last year 16%, what are the causes there and why do you think it will stop? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. This is Greg, I'll give a comment. I think, Steve and Kurt also say. First of all, there were tailwinds. No question, there were few tailwinds helping us. Inflation is a good thing. A few categories that had some tailwinds behind it saves and a few other things of that nature, which goes slowly kind of work their way off, okay, out of the comparable sales numbers. I don't believe \u2013 because we track this very closely with competitive intrusion, and we don't believe that it is anything that we had done to not refresh the business or bring newness to the business. I do believe, however, that the entire four wall retail businesses around the country and many segments have seen some decline. And maybe, we were part of some of that, but because I think the consumer has fallen in love with digital, which our consumer has as well. So, we have seen some shifting, as Steve mentioned earlier, we could see as much as 2% of our business this year bring down on the digital side. So there's been some shifting moving between four wall and digital, but in general I would tell you that some of those tailwinds became headwinds. And we didn't anticipate honestly the difficult business in the Texas, Oklahoma, and I'll call it the coldest regions as it's often due to the pullback in the oil markets, that was very, very difficult to overcome. Okay. That's been it (54:24) Operator : And we do have our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening. I'm curious, I think you had talked in the past about a labor optimization that you were going to put in place in late 2017. Is it your expectation that you will roll that out in late 2017? And if so, do you expect to roll it out via test or all at once and what kind of impact might that have from the tail of the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Ben, I think what we talked about is that we were going to look at labor management and payroll management as kind of a combined or task management as a combined system, and we talked about starting it \u2013 hoping to start it in the fall of this year and running it into 2018 as a completion. So, we're still on task to do that, we have not chosen the final testing yet, but we plan to do that by midyear. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then if I could just one quick follow-up on the deflation, 50 basis points in the quarter I think for the year you had previously said you expected a range of 10 basis points to 30 basis points deflation. Is that still your expectation or keeping that higher-level deflation in 1Q, has that changed at all? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. I would say that we are seeing a little bit more of deflation than our original expectations. And we still believe that we're seeing signs that it would moderate in the back half of the year. So, as we saw 50 basis points in Q1, I would say our expectation on deflation is more like a 20 basis points to 30 basis point impact for the year, with that being closer to the high end of that range in Q2 and moderating in the back half. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good evening. I had two quick follow-ups, so the 2% to 3% comp in April, does that include what sounds like a small headwind from the overall Easter shift? And then can you talk about the performance of the mature store cohort relative to chain and perhaps if you've isolated it along weather impacted and non-weather impacted markets like facing North versus South? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay, Chris. I'll address the first question there. Yeah, Easter is a headwind in that 2% to 3%. For the quarter, that is about a 60 basis point headwind on Q2, and the lost comp sales day for the year is about a 20 basis point impact for the year. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And that 2% to 3%, that 60 basis points is like an annualized \u2013 the 2% to 3% is sort of netted at 60 basis points basically. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: That's right. It assumes and includes for the quarter a 60 basis point headwind on the quarter. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: And the second question, could you repeat the second question? Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So the question is, can you talk about the performance of your mature stores versus I know the West is seeing some lift out of a younger store base out there. So how are the mature stores performing, and obviously you had some in weather impacted markets and some in not. So maybe the stores in the South where there was a lot less weather impacting the overall trend, those mature stores? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Yeah. Directionally, what we're seeing is that as we've said, the less mature stores have a faster high comp sales growth than the mature stores. And then \u2013 so there is somewhat of a gap between the 5 years or less stores in the mature ones. And consistent, at least looking at Q1, the mature stores were less than the less mature stores, but they behaved similar geographically. So when it comes to mature stores in the West to mature stores in the South, they outperformed the mature stores in the North. So there's somewhat of a gap between those, but they behaved very similar. And for the quarter, the mature stores had the same typical headwinds as the less mature store due to weather. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wesbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot and good evening. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: How are you doing, Seth? Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good. My question is around the gross margins. Just if you could provide a little more detail, maybe disaggregate the gross margin performance a bit more for this quarter between markdowns, promo and freight, and then provide some \u2013 a little bit more of color and expectations for which of these buckets will improve the most for you to achieve your guidance for over 25 basis points of improvement in gross margins down the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. For first quarter, the product rate being the clearance, markdown as well as any promos along with freight were the most impactful factors to margin. And then I would say, after that the headwind that we saw and knew we were cycling, but the next most impactful would've been cycling the benefit we got from the discounts for inventory related to new distribution center. The other headwinds that we described were of lesser impact. Specific to go forward, Q1 did have some unique items in there. So I'd first say that, the things that were unique to the first quarter such as cycling the vendor funding related to the inventory in the DC, the clearance on the winter seasonal goods and even to some extent the additional promotions that Steve talked to were unique to first quarter. However, we do see some greater headwinds than originally expected in freight. We had said that we saw \u2013 or expected freight to be about a 10 basis point headwind in 2017. Based on what we're seeing today, that's more closer to a 20 basis point headwind and then we do have a few other areas that mix particular that if we continue to grow strong in the C.U.E. items, mix will likely be a bit of a headwind for Q2 and potential for us go forward. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. So, just to understand that 25 basis points to 30 basis point gross margin improvement for the year that guidance, is that still good or do you think there might be a little bit of downside risk to that based on freight and mix? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. And I would just say, again, we're not updating guidance, but I will say as I look to Q2 that it'll be more challenges, more headwind to try to achieving that range for Q2 than our original expectations. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thank you and good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Greg, I want to go back to some of the comments you made in your prepared comments, just with regard to the headwinds and tailwinds and specifically with respect to the C.U.E. business. So, overall, is C.U.E. still \u2013 as you think about that analysis, is C.U.E. still a tailwind to the business and maybe explain why there? Then with regard to Q1, it seemed \u2013 the color you gave us, it seemed that the C.U.E. sales held up well, so I wanted to confirm that, indeed did the C.U.E. sales help volume, and I guess, the question I'd ask there is, did the promotions and all help to drive better C.U.E. sales in Q1? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Brian, let me answer it this way. C.U.E. business is \u2013 the things that you'll find in our store at any given time of the year that makes sense for the customer that they buy in high volume and high quantity, hydraulic fluid, wood pellets, certain products in feed and food, so on and so forth. C.U.E. units continue to increase. So we feel good about our unit increase overall in the C.U.E. categories which tells us we're still taking share. However, deflation continues to play a major role in some of those C.U.E. categories. So, I've said this before, a bag of bird seed that was at one time we considered as a C.U.E. item in the first quarter that was selling for $19 to $22, is now selling for $16, let's say it as an example, due to deflation. Those are tough comparisons to offset. I've got to see another 30%-some-odd increase in units just to be able to offset last year's comparable volume. So there is where some of that quirkiness comes into play. But, we're very, very comfortable with C.U.E., we track it very closely. Steve and the team have a pulse on it, literally daily and we continue to see share \u2013 take share. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good evening, guys. I apologize, if this was asked before, because I was disconnected earlier. But I guess my question is, how should we think about the balance sheet going forward? Look I know this was a tough quarter, but we had AP'd inventory ratios fall pretty sharply. You guys are paying a dividend, you bought back a bunch of stocks, your debt levels have risen quite a bit. So I guess the question is, should we expect more debt to come on the balance sheet during the balance of the year, does that cause you potentially to pull back on your buyback program, because you don't want to add more debt? Or will the seasonal cash flow cadence that you're anticipating help reduce those cash needs? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Scot, I'll first start with \u2013 this quarter had some unique items. Steve mentioned the earlier spring seasonal buys. And so, with our effort in January, February, addressing what looked to be potentially be an early start to spring, we pulled some receipts forward. So in regards to the balance sheet on the AP and the inventory side, it's somewhat unique to the quarter in that, the growth in the inventory is fresh spring-related items. We pulled it forward that played into the timing of our payments, and so you see that on the balance sheet. To a lesser extent, one other thing that we faced in Q1, this one, we face whenever we have a 53rd week shift, the end of the quarter ended a week later, that does impact the timing of a key payables point to our merchant and rent vendors, and so you see a little bit of that drag compared to the prior quarter as well. In regards to debt, I would just say that we look at Q1 and Q3 as those peak particular times, and you're seeing with the uniqueness a heightened level of debt, we expect in Q2 for that to go back to normal levels. We've said we're targeting and comfortable with the 2 times debt leverage ratio and other than a few particular peak times, we see ourselves at about $400 million in debt \u2013 $450 million in debt at the end of the year. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Very helpful. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: And we don't expect at this point that to change any of our plan or cadence on capital allocation or dividend or share repurchase. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Understood. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you very much. With respect to the gross margin, Greg, you cited that e-commerce was a headwind on the gross margin. So assuming that e-comm continues to grow at a rate greater than your stores, what kind of level can we assume will be kind of a continuous gross margin headwind from the fact that you're growing e-comm at a greater rate? And then my second question is, I appreciate the color you provided with respect to the 600 basis point delta on a market basis as a result of the weather. I was curious if you can maybe segment that a different way and tell us how much in total that the oil patch states underperformed the rest of the corporate average? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Alan I'll take those. First in regards to the e-commerce and the gross margin, we called out the growth in e-commerce and its impact on freight. So, with our e-commerce business growing, it does have a higher freight rate and we've always had some level of burden, but e-commerce as small as it is, it's not had much of an impact, we are excited about the growth we have in the e-commerce business and we have seen a few basis points increase in the burden on the freight line within gross margin. So, we called it out. I believe that we'll see that continue in the future quarters. And as our e-commerce business grows, it could have a 1 basis points or 2 basis points impact throughout the year on the gross margin rate. And then \u2013 yeah, go ahead. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : No please. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : The delta on the oil patch? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, sure. In regards to the oil patch, I'd first say that the Texas region like much of the South had less of an impact on weather. So, we did not see as much volatility in sales in the Texas area, but specific to the oil patch, as Greg mentioned, we see it moderating and in the quarter we had a close to 30 basis point headwind against the \u2013 30 basis points headwind on the comps due to the oil patch stores. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Next we have Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I thought if I could ask about BOPIS a little bit and then specifically to give us some examples, what types of categories or products you're seeing strong there, how this is incremental to current traffic? And then, similar to that, at the Analyst Day, I remember you speaking a little bit about potentially thinking about a subscription based program for some of the renewable C.U.E. based items, and what your sort of thought process is around that at the moment? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Adam, this is Steve. I would tell you that, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store, what we're finding is, is that our customers have an interest across the four walls. It's nothing in specific. In many cases, it's in multiples that they're buying. So it maybe fencing outside. It could be product that is on promotion for example, where they're maybe trying to reserve something, so they can get in and get the deal. But it's really across the entire spectrum of the four walls. So it's nothing that I can point to and say that 80% of what we're seeing there is one category or even a one side of the store. The second question was regarding the subscription. We talked about ONETractor and we talked about anytime, anywhere and anywhere customers want to shop a Tractor, and one of the capabilities that we're working on right now is subscription. It's one of many. And we fully anticipate making good traction on that throughout this year. And you will see us as we continue to talk with you all in these conference calls, we'll give you the traction that we're making, but it's definitely high on the list for us. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Just on the BOPIS answer just real quick if I could? So I'm unsure that in future, things that are already in the store and I imagine you generally having already high capture rate, the customers in your area, how it's actually incremental? I mean, would these people not becoming into the store to begin with to buy these things? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Well, I would tell you, it's two-prong. Yes, in some cases and I think if you would talk to most retailers, they would tell you that because I have certain retailers that I go to, that I would have gone to anyways and I use Buy Online Pickup in Store. But I would also tell you there has been several examples where we've modified our marketing budget in our spend there. And we have gone from what has been traditional over to digital, and buying SEM search words, we have found that customers are going in. I'll use the example of, the first Buy Online Pickup order that we had was actually a customer who was searching for trailers, and they never shopped at Tractor Supply before, searched the word, went on to our site, reviewed it, looked at the content, used Buy Online Pickup in Store and came in and bought two of them from us. So it's hard to pinpoint exactly who is using it, but I can tell you that we do believe it's a mix of both. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust. Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Mitch on for David. Just ex-ing out the weather impact in the first quarter, how do you feel about big ticket demand in general? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: What I would say in regards to big ticket is, what we saw was the biggest headwind on the big ticket sales was the spring seasonal product. And so, I would say that big ticket demand was flat to potentially slightly positive, if you ex out the headwind that we're up against last year in the March spring seasonal. So big-ticket clearly became a stronger component of the average ticket in the month of March, as we cycled the strong spring seasonal and did not achieve those spring seasonal sales in Q1. Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hey, guys. Yeah. Most of my questions were answered. I just want to follow-up on one other thing. Are there any new products that you guys have in the store or testing, I recall like a year ago, maybe like you tried some things with kayaks or something like outdoorsy or are there things that are maybe tangential to the business that, that maybe a way to drive additional traffic? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Joe, this is Steve. And I would tell you, we've been talking a lot about different digital things that we're doing and ways that we're attracting new customers in our stores, but there's also an opportunity with our existing customers base to sell them new and different things like you're mentioning. And so, for example this year, we've expanded beekeeping, because we know our customers are self-reliant, and that is an unique item that really is all about sustainability, that we've expanded our organic selection both in lawn and garden, as well as in our livestock feed section, and we're seeing incredibly nice comps there. A lot of the resets we've done in adding new brands, we're expanding 4health to customers, our outdoor sporting goods for example continues to grow. We've added it to more stores at this point. We're up to between 200 stores and 300 stores. We've expanded ammo, which is another key item for us, so we think our customers are looking for it. And I'll even go as far as to tell you that we're testing live crickets and worms in a lot of these sporting goods stores as well, to see if there's an interest or a demand from our customers. So there is a lot of things going on within the four walls themselves that should continue to drive that momentum that we've talked about in the past. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : That's great. Thank you for that and good luck with the quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. You mentioned before that you've got tools to look at competitor pricing now, so what are some of the key learnings so far and what opportunities do you see in pricing? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Denise, this is Steve again. I would tell you that's one of the capabilities right now that we're working on. When we talk about all the new things we're putting into and our capabilities for ONETractor. So while we have a tool out there today that is going out and web scraping for us and it's been effective for us for the most part, we've had that for now two years, I would tell you a more comprehensive tool that would give us more insight into more competitors and more SKUs will be much more beneficial as we move forward and I'll be able to give you more on that probably in the upcoming quarters. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then just back to big ticket for a moment. It sounds like you're \u2013 it's like, excuse me, some kind of weather and timing impacts and things. If you could put it aside it sounds like you're actually a little bit more positive towards big ticket, so in the past when there has been big ticket cycle, how long did it last? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: The last part of the question is tough Denise, as it relates to weather. So, I'll let Steve maybe think about that, I want to see if he can go back in history. But I would tell you that generally big ticket is more significant in Q2 than it is in Q1 with the spring seasonal. And the only thing I did mention in the last time was the headwind of safes. And so, big ticket spring seasonal was the biggest headwind, outside of the weather, there would have been a little bit of a headwind still with the sluggishness of the safe sales. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : This conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Thank you everyone for your continued support and interest in Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking with you again in July regarding our second quarter results. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

Greg, please go ahead. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, and Kurt Barton, our Chief Financial Officer. We experienced broad-based positive sales trends across our business in the second quarter. Store transaction counts were healthy at a positive 2.2% to last year and our average ticket trend improved by quarter end. Online traffic was also strong with unique visits up 28% and much more traffic coming from mobile devices. While our performance continued to be led by our animal and pet categories, we were pleased to see improved performance across many of our other major departments. With favorable weather conditions, the strong demand has continued for spring seasonal products and we believe the momentum has extended the selling season into the early weeks of the third quarter. For some time now, we have been sharing with you our initiatives to link the physical and digital components of our business to provide our customers one seamless shopping experience. Broadly speaking, we call this our One Tractor initiative and we are starting to see signs that the physical and digital sides of our business are working well together and support one another. As the connection between our stores and the online presence strengthens, we see evidence that these initiatives are improving our top-line results. We know that we have a dedicated, loyal customer who shops our stores for our unique merchandise offerings and our great customer service. We also know that the Internet is a powerful tool in retailing today. We strongly believe our unique merchandise assortment, conveniently located stores and experienced team members, along with our integrated digital store fronts are points of differentiation for us from other farm and ranch stores and online competitors. We continue to invest in initiatives to drive convenience, personalization, customer service, and operating efficiencies across our business. During the second quarter, we completed the rollout of our Buy Online Pick Up in Store program. We know this was a very important feature for our customers as it gives them greater flexibility and added convenience when shopping with us. They can place an order online, be assured the product is there at the store and pick up that order soon thereafter. They don't have to wait for the package to arrive or deal with the hassle of shipping back product, if a return is necessary and they can receive seasoned advice from our team members while shopping for other products in our stores. We continue to see positive response from our customers with over 55% of our online orders in the second quarter being picked up at our stores. Additionally, the average order value for a Buy Online Pick Up in Store transaction is larger than the total company average and we believe there is an opportunity for this program to increase our average basket size over time. Also in the second quarter, we continued to grow and develop our Neighbor's Club customer rewards program. This program was expanded to all stores in April and enrollment continues to grow very rapidly exceeding our initial expectations and we are now approaching 4 million members. Our Neighbor's Club members are some of our best and most engaged customers and we expect to strengthen our relationship with them by capturing and utilizing information regarding their buying habits and tailoring our communications to their particular product and information needs. As we develop our Neighbor's Club customer attribution data, we will be capable of improving our targeting to these customers and regularly inform them about new products and upcoming events that matter most to them. While very early in the program, we have noted that our higher Neighbor's Club membership stores are outperforming our lower penetration stores in sales. We believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage this program across our entire store base to drive our sales, customer insights and customer loyalty. Our Buy Online Pick Up in Store and Neighbor's Club programs are two sizeable initiatives that we have been developing for some time and are beginning to generate momentum. We believe both of these initiatives will be powerful sales drivers for years to come. Two other initiatives that we're testing and we believe could be meaningful longer term, are mobile POS and stockyard. Mobile POS is an in-store initiative that allows our associates to locate products, find information, check inventory in surrounding stores and process the sale through a mobile POS device. In our initial store test, mobile POS has already proven to be a great time saver for team members and our customers. And stockyard is another store level initiative that merges our online capabilities with our store operations. This initiative allows us to dramatically increase the selection of product offerings at store level using our vendors' inventories for fulfillment. Our team members can increase customer loyalty by offering our customer access to purchase items not normally carried in our stores and have them drop shipped to the location of their choice by extending our digital footprint utilizing tractorsupply.com. Today, we are a 24/7 retailer. We're using technology to make the shopping journey easier. While digital integration is important, we know that we are a successful brick-and-mortar retailer, opening new stores each year. Our customer appreciates our differentiated product offerings, our convenient locations and expects knowledgeable team members to assist them. We are constantly updating our product and event offerings to meet the needs of our customers that will in the end drive traffic into our stores and to tractorsupply.com. And we continue to execute new product resets year-round that deliver innovation, newness and provide greater value to our customers. To generate excitement and theater in our stores, we're adding a new fall Chick Days event this year and hosting a one day fall Farmers Market based upon the success we experienced in a test earlier this spring. We continue to see very high interest in locally sponsored store level events and strongly believe these events to support the communities that we serve. These events are another key differentiator for our business and they drive continued interaction with the brand. Now, with respect to Petsense, we are continuing to improve our understanding of that business model and have identified numerous merchandise and operational opportunities to grow that chain. I'm pleased with the performance of those stores that we've opened this year and will continue to see the benefits, as we bring this concept to rural communities with both quality brands and the added convenience of services such as grooming and the mobile vet offerings that we have. So in summary, I am encouraged with our execution this quarter and I believe that the long-term investments we are making, along with some moderation in the headwinds we have seen over the past 18 months, are beginning to positively impact our top-line results. As I said last quarter, we are confident we are investing in the areas that will drive sustainable, long-term growth, but we cannot guarantee that this growth will always be a smooth and linear path. We will, however, continue to be as transparent as possible about our business and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to extend a big thank you to all our team at Tractor Supply and Petsense, who continue to serve our customers and execute our business plan every day. You are the driving force behind our success. I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to take you through our second quarter financial results. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended July 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $2.02 billion, resulting in net income of $160.6 million and EPS of $1.25 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 2.2% versus a reported decrease of 0.5% last year. As a reminder, our Q2 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last quarter's second quarter comparable store sales increase would have been a positive 1.0%. Also, this year's second quarter had one less sales day compared to the second quarter of 2016. We estimate the one less sales day impacted comparable store sales by approximately 60 basis points, and the comp store sales increase would have been approximately 2.8% on an equivalent quarter basis. Comp store sales performance rebounded nicely from the 2.2% decline in the first quarter. Comp stores were positive across all geographic regions and the sales by month was generally consistent throughout the quarter. From a merchandise standpoint, the sales growth was broad-based, with most of our major product categories experiencing positive comp store sales. Once again, the livestock and pet category led our comp performance and we continued to experience solid demand for many of our basic everyday items. Comparable store transaction count increased 2.2% or approximately 2.8%, adjusting for the one less sales day. This compares to prior year's reported 1.5% increase, or 2.7% adjusted for the week shift. Comparable store transaction count increased across all regions of the country and was driven by strength in our C.U.E. items. Both average comp ticket and big ticket sales were flat to prior year. Product resets and new assortment offerings helped sales of certain big ticket products such as chicken coops, generators and grills, but these sales were offset by softness in other seasonal categories. Outdoor power equipment sales were soft in the back half of the quarter, but cooler temperatures and greater moisture has extended the spring selling season, and we've seen an improvement in the outdoor power equipment category in the early part of third quarter. Deflation impacted average ticket by approximately 30 basis points. As a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those stores will be included in the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now, turning to gross margin, which decreased 10 basis points to 34.9% compared to a 30-basis-point decrease in the prior year. Product margin was essentially flat to prior year with no significant impact from mix or rate. We were pleased with the merchandising team's ability to maintain gross margin rate with a balanced pricing approach that incorporates both market share and margin-driving strategies. Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories, higher average fuel costs, and to a lesser extent, growth in our online business. Petsense provided a slight benefit to gross margin, as these stores operate at a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores. For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 50 basis points to 22.1% of sales, compared to 21.6% of sales in the prior quarter. The SG&A growth principally reflects our investment in a few key strategic areas, a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience, also, our investments in technology to grow our digital capabilities, and then, Petsense which operates at a higher SG&A rate. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% compared to 36.8% last year. The increase in the rate principally reflects lower state tax incentive credits compared to the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $68 million and $454 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $151 million and $196 million in outstanding debt last year. During the second quarter, we acquired 2.2 million shares for $134 million through our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have acquired a total of 3.8 million shares for $248 million. The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 6.5% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense, average inventory levels per store increased 1.1% compared to a 1.2% decrease in last year's second quarter. We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter, as well as the management of our working capital. Given the seasonal nature of some of our product categories, we evaluate our business based on the performance of the halves and not just the quarters. With this in mind, let me make a few brief comments on our first half performance. Consolidated net sales grew 7.9%, and we had positive comp sales of 0.2% for the first half versus an adjusted increase of 1.7% last year. Comparable store transaction count increased 0.5% for the first half compared to an adjusted 2.7% in the prior year. While sales and gross margin trends improved in the second quarter, our first half results were below our expectations, with the majority of the shortfall from the first quarter. Now, with respect to our outlook. Based on the trends and results of the first half of the year, we've revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2017. We expect full year sales to range from $7.13 billion to $7.19 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1.1% and 1.7% and net income to range from $413 million to $419 million and earnings per diluted share to be $3.22 to $3.27. Assumed in this guidance is an operating margin decline of 80 to 100 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% to 36.9%, average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 128.2 million to 128.8 million and capital expenditures of $250 million to $270 million. We estimate deflation will impact full year same-store sales by approximately 30 basis points, which includes the second half forecast of approximately 20 basis points impact. Our revised comparable store sales outlook assumes a comp estimate of 2.0% to 3.0% in the second half of the year. Based on our Q2 trends and early third quarter momentum, we are keeping our comp store sales assumptions for the back half generally consistent with our original plan. As a reminder, the third quarter is cycling an adjusted negative 1.1% comparable store sales from the third quarter of last year and the fourth quarter is cycling a prior year positive 3.8% comparable store sales result. While our timing of new store openings is slightly behind our original forecast, we expect to hit our 100-store target and continue to be pleased with the new store productivity. For the year, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly down due to the decline it experienced in the first half. Thus, we are estimating a slight improvement in gross margin during the back half. With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points this year. Factors to consider are : first, higher payroll expense to drive strong customer service levels in our stores along with cycling favorable medical and workers' compensation related costs in the prior year are key contributors to the deleveraging of expenses in the back half of the year. Additionally, depreciation expense is expected to grow 16% to 17% over the prior year, resulting from our key strategic investments in technology, our LED lighting retrofit program and supply chain enhancements. Additionally, Petsense will have an unfavorable impact on SG&A leverage for the full year. Also, let remind you that the prior year's second half SG&A benefited from strong expense control, a reduction in incentive compensation, and favorable medical and workers' compensation expenses. Additionally, the 53rd week benefited last year's second half and full year expense leverage, and also added approximately $0.055 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 36.7% to 36.9%, as we do not expect to see tax benefit in the current year from the new accounting rules related to the recognition of the tax benefit on stock options exercised. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks a lot and good afternoon. And nice progress in the quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: My question, Greg, is do you think we're at an inflection for the business? So you did a 2.2% this quarter, did 2.8% adjusted for Easter. You kept the guidance for the second half for 2% to 3%. The first half overall was basically flat though, and I know over time, you've taught us to look at the business in halves. So I'm just wondering can you give us a better sense of what you think is driving that improvement in the second half of the year. What gives you confidence in that? I know you talked about the moderation in some of the headwinds. If you can elaborate on that, I think it would be really helpful. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth, a couple of things. I think number one, we always talk about the halves, not the quarters and I look at the first quarter as an anomaly. I really did. I also would tell you that we're seeing some very positive signs that our consumers are back in our stores, our customer service levels have never been better and I think that our consumers, not only in stores, but even online are finding that we're in stock, we can take care of their needs, and now that they're out doing these projects and that we are the place that they're choosing to shop with. But I think what I should do is maybe throw this over to Steve and let him talk to you about a few things that he believes also he's seeing in the merchant marketing side. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth, this is Steve. I would tell you there's probably a handful of things, because we sit down and really analyze the business when we took a look at the forward-look here. And I would tell you that our Q2 sales trend give us a bit more confidence as we work our way into the year that things were starting to play out like we had intended originally. Greg mentioned that we're seeing a bit of an extended selling season on the spring product into July, which gives us a little bit of confidence. We've experienced a number of headwinds and we brought those up over the last 18 months and Greg addressed this in his initial comments, and we're certain to see a little bit of a moderation in some of those headwinds such as some of the oil impacted stores as well as deflation. And finally, I would go as far as to say that some of the initiatives that both Greg and Kurt spoke of, relative to the Neighbor's Club, Buy Online Pick Up in Store, and even some of the merchandising events that we've got plan for the back half, give us some degree of confidence that the things that we're doing are working. So that's why we kind of laid out what we did, that 2% to 3%. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. So I wanted to actually talk a little bit about digital and because you talked a little bit about that in your prepared remarks. And the one thing that I wanted to focus on was the evidence that the initiatives are contributing to the top-line results. Can you maybe help walk us through a little bit that in more detail, what evidence there is that you're seeing and why you have that level of confidence? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Matt, this is Steve. So we scaled Buy Online Pick Up in Store, I'll start there, across the entire chain. I think it was back in May. And those Buy Online Pick Up in Store sales represented just over 50% of our online business. And if you look at our direct-to-customer business, we continue to see very strong double-digit comps there as well. So when you tie the two together, we're feeling very good that our customer \u2013 we've always known that they've gone online for the content, and part of this One Tractor initiative is to make sure that we support them anytime, anywhere and anyway they want to work with us. Now, the store is really the epicenter of our transactional business. But this outside opportunity for customers to do the research and come online continues to grow. The unique customers coming to our site were up almost 29% from a year ago. And in addition to that, the store locator button that we have on the site was up almost 60% from a year ago. So we see the digital part of our business really enhancing the store experience. And so that's why I think we have some degree of confidence that our initiatives are paying off. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, if I may, one follow-up, just on Farmers Market, you talked about that at the Analyst Day and I was wondering now that we progress throughout the year a little bit, if you could talk a little bit about how is that performed as you roll that out to other stores in the chain? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, we've got some great feedback when we did it this spring, and while the business was very strong during that window of time, it really wasn't about a one-day type of initiative. It's really about working in communities that our stores are located and making sure those folks in and around those communities feel like Tractor is a hub for them. And the feedback we've got from our store operators, guys, it was fantastic, but let's take a look at this in the back half of the year as well so that they have more opportunities to sell more unique and different things. For example, a lot of the harvest products that they may bring in from their gardens. So we see this partly as an opportunity to bring new people to Tractor Supply, but at the same time, we see this as an opportunity to really be part of the community that we serve. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. My first question is, I guess, a follow-up on the guidance. So the back half, I think Kurt mentioned 2% to 3% comps implied for the rest of the year. Yet, it looks like the margin profile of the business is a bit worse. The incrementals look weak. And Kurt mentioned a couple of items on the SG&A side. Is it just that that you have some of those tough compares? Or is the cost of the business going up a little from investments that you're making in the back half? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Seth (sic) [Simeon], this is Kurt. Couple of things in there as I mentioned on the gross margin side, there's a slightly less benefit in the back half than our original forecast was on the gross margin side. And then, on the expense side of it, there's the additional spend, as Greg mentioned, on the store payroll. We see a lot of strong feedback and benefit from great customer service in stores. So there's additional store investment on the back half as well. And then, you mentioned the third thing. The back half of the year has some strong compares in the 53rd week, as well as some of the cost savings and favorable benefit we got from certain insurance reserves, such as medical and workers' comp in the back half last year. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, my follow-up you mentioned that in the back half, gross margin is expected to be, I think, you said flat or up a bit. Can you talk about what the risks, meaning if you don't get there, what are some of the culprits if gross margin isn't up in the back half of the year? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. A couple of things on there, Seth (sic) [Simeon]. I'd say that the biggest factor on the gross margin side is that we do see freight headwinds persisting in the second half as we do in the first half. And then, the difference that we see on the gross margin side is that we do see some momentum from the gross margin improvement that we saw in second quarter and we anticipate that those trends will continue in the second half. And we see that those will be some of the tailwinds that we've got on it. The expense side are the things I just mentioned in the first part of your question. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Peter Benedict of Robert Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Just a follow-up on that question, so the momentum, Kurt, you just mentioned the momentum on gross margin in the second half. And the second quarter, I mean, it was down for the quarter a bit. Can you speak a little bit more to what is breaking right for you on the gross margin side that you think is going to hold that number up? Because if freight is still a bit of headwind, what's going to kind of carry the day on gross margin in the back half? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Peter. A couple of things. What we saw in the second quarter that was different is we did see a momentum change in the first part of the second quarter all the way to the backend strength in some of our pricing initiatives as well as the exclusive brands. Our assumptions for the back half, we see opportunity and growth on the gross margin with additional exclusive brand products and growth there, as well as continuing on the pricing side the momentum that we saw in the second quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: And Peter, the only thing I would add to that \u2013 this is Steve \u2013 is that if you look at where we're at right now, Greg had mentioned a little bit of an extended selling season of spring product, we feel like we'll be in a really good position where we won't experience maybe deep markdowns. And we think that will benefit us here at least in the third quarter, as we go into Q4. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful, guys. And just on the CapEx, I know you kind of pulled that in a little bit, what's kind of coming out? And just can you give us a sense for when you think about the cash coming in and the leverage ratio of the business, how comfortable are you with where you're at in terms of leverage where you're comfortable taking that in the future? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Peter, first on the CapEx, the most significant difference is the Northeast distribution center capital spend that was in the original plan. There was a decrease and that's the most significant factor on the CapEx and it's a timing issue. The timing of the spend has shifted out of 2017 into 2018. Most of the other parts of the spend are relatively consistent, maybe a slight reduction on new stores and slight reduction on IT. As far as the capital spend side, we look at the back half as operating cash flow fairly consistent with last year and I would anticipate our debt to be in the $500 million to $550 million range by the end of the year, and that's pretty consistent in line with our targets of a 2.0 leverage ratio. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. This is Rob Iannarone on for Scott. Thanks for taking the call. As we think about the SG&A investments, as we're going to see in the second half here, should we view that as more of a one-time bump, because sales have been a bit on the slower side or should we assume you guys are going to invest more in labor to improve the customer service levels on more of a longer-term basis? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Robert, I'll take that. This is Greg. I would tell you that the results that we've seen from our efforts to bring what I would call our store themes, level of customer service back to levels that we're excited about and we've seen this through our SMG reporting, it's not a short-term thing. Although as we believe the sales will come with that investment, I think we'll be able to leverage some of that over time. So it's a little bit of a step-out, but it's also a step-up, I believe, in driving the sales. Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you for that. And just one other, a little bit separate here. When you think about big ticket and average ticket, are you concerned at all there that those remained flat despite stronger seasonal trends? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Steve. I think Kurt mentioned that where we fell short really was in some of the seasonal spring businesses, because we saw some pretty good movement in categories, like Kurt mentioned, chicken coops and grills, generators and a few other categories. They were just offset. What we did also say is that we saw a bit of an extended selling season and Greg had mentioned in his opening remarks, I think it was outdoor power equipment, so some of that maybe just delayed. Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you very much. You talked about there being significant opportunities to grow the Petsense format. I'm wondering if maybe you could provide a little bit of color since it's almost a year under your belt as to how those unit economics compare with the legacy Tractor format. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Alan, this is Greg. I'll start off by telling you that it's not been a year, it's been about only six months. And what we're learning is that in these real markets, we have a niche of consumers there that is a little different than the Tractor consumer who needs high service, who needs maybe a little higher mix of what I'd call premium brand products that they can't find really anywhere else and they may find it in an individual mom and pop. So when we did our research on Petsense and the history that we had developed with our experience with HomeTown Pet, it clearly showed that there was at least 1,000 stores markets out there that we could place this concept. So it is very different than Tractor from a standpoint of its offering of services and even mix. It will be more bifurcated as we go forward. That particular organization, from a economic standpoint, a little higher SG&A but also higher margins because of the mix of the services piece. So we like the model. We like the way it's going to add, I think, incremental value to TSC over time. But it won't be the same ramp that you'll see in Tractor storage right now. We still have some more learning to do and, as I said, when we made the purchase, it's about a year's worth of learning before we can start to push the pedal down. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. And one follow-up, if I may, Greg. On the Pets, you've talked about the relative low vulnerability of the Tractor Supply stores to e-comm. Now, you're talking about the greater connectivity that you're seeing between the stores and online as that strengthens. Net-net, do you think that there's a little bit more vulnerability to e-comm than online today than what you saw even one or two years ago? And if so, what incremental changes are you going to make going forward for the anticipated accelerated growth online? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: What I would tell you is this and I think Steve will probably join here as well is I don't use the word vulnerability. I would use that the consumers' purchasing patterns and interest and how they engage with us is changing. And there are some products in our stores that are virtually impossible to sell online and be able to move to a consumer in a way that makes any sense or any money. But secondly, you can't underestimate the importance of having that store and that availability of the online component where the customer can research, engage with us as a brand and make the decision, because they're in control. They make the decision if they want to shop the store, if they want to buy directly online, have it shipped to them, that's an element that I don't think we understood until we turned on Buy Online Pick Up in Store how powerful that was. And what's amazing to us is the amount of our customers that like to still come to our store. They buy online but they choose to make the pickup in our store. It's a very high percentage in comparison to most, I'll call it, other retailers that have both sides of the business. So Steve, anything you want to say? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, the only thing I would say is it's still a relatively small percent of our total revenue. I mean, this year, I believe between Buy Online Pick Up in Store and what we're going to do in direct sales, it's good to be between 1% and 2% of our total overall revenue. So it's still relatively small. It is a convenience for our customer and I think we've always had good traffic to our site and I think the investments that both Greg and Kurt talked about with IT are going to help us in the future. So your next question, I believe you ask is what are you going to do as your customer continues to evolve, and I will tell you there's a number of capabilities that, right now, we're working on or have actually put into play that's enhancing that experience. For example, we've got e-gift card, which we just rolled out, expanded offerings. We're working on enhanced search. By the end of the year, we should have subscription up and running, which I think will be a great offering to our customers. And whether they take advantage of that or not, we'll have to find out, but we believe that's a real benefit to them. And of course, stockyard and special orders, so there's a lot of things that I think we're doing to evolve with our customers' needs and that's of no surprise. So we've been working on this for years and I think right now, we're really getting a much better understanding of how to best accommodate those customers. Operator : And we will take our next question from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good evening. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So I wanted to follow up just as you're thinking about the back half. I know you do some work in the planning process around the weather, and that really hasn't cooperated with you at least in the fall the past couple of years. So what are you expecting in terms of the fall heating season, and then, as you get into December and lap that cold snowy month from December last year, how are you paced or positioned against the weather? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Christopher, this is Kurt, I'll start and I'll just say that our assumptions baked into our revised guidance for the back half assumes more normalized weather there. I'll just start with that, in that, last year, we had a slow start to the fall winter season and sluggish September as well as October, November, we're soft, and then, as you referred to the December. We see a more normalized year between Q3 and Q4 as the main factor that we baked into our guidance. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. And I would just say to add on to that a little bit, Christopher, that it was a slow ramp this last year. We did have a nice December. The team's working around other initiatives that we can put into place to offset some of that vulnerability, if you want to call it that, but a lot of the resets that we're working on and things within the store are really C.U.E. based and C.U.E. focused. So while that will always be a factor, we're trying to lessen the impact. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I got it. And I know it's a little early, but a lot has happened over the past two years. And so, as you look out beyond the back half, how do you think about the pace of store opens? Is 100 the right number for the year? And then, thinking about the investment pressures, I know some of it is one-off items cycling in the back half, but does the investment cycle extend into 2018 and does that sort of push the leverage point to the upper end or even further on the 2%, 3% comp algo? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Christopher, it's Kurt. First, on the new stores, as I mentioned, we're excited about new store productivity. Our new stores are continuing to be part of our growth strategy, in that, they're driving the comp sales as well as the bottom line profit. Our new stores typically are profitable in year one. So yes, we see in 2018 and beyond where our targets of approximately 100 stores, it's a good fit for our internal resource structure. We can grow those 100 stores with a lot of the existing support and good opportunity for Tractor Supply out there. Other investments, we anticipate our capital spend would be somewhat consistent in the near future years to what you're seeing in 2017. And I would say yes, the investments on the technology side, logistic supply chain to drive and support our key initiatives, we're expecting those in the near term as well. But we'll be cycling that type of level as that investment is baked into the operating margin today. But yes, we've got years where we're going to continue to drive support on the digital and the logistics side. Operator : And our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens, Inc. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to \u2013 you made a comment about your customers, you're seeing evidence of your customers coming back into your stores. I'm curious, are you seeing customers shopping parts of the stores that maybe they weren't over the last year or are they just broadly coming in and shopping the store when they may not have even been in the store over the course of the last year-and-a-half or so? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey, Ben, this is Greg. One of the things that we've seen through the additional layers of, I'll call it, customer service we've been able to give our customers is a more satisfied customer who seems to be shopping across more categories. Now, that being said, we have a little bit more favorable weather here as we kind of ended the quarter. And I would tell you that we've seen no slowdown in our C.U.E. business and the consumable side of our business that keeps driving it. As we add more and more product categories there and as Steve and the merchant team continue to break things out there, we're finding that we saw our transaction counts move back up, average size of our transactions holding even without, okay, having some of that big ticket tailwind that we'd like to see. So all these things are good, positive signs that our customers are still with us, still shopping with us, still choosing us over others, and we're encouraged as we go into the third quarter and the second half that will continue. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on the e-commerce side, you noted some of the traction that you've achieved there with the enhancements you've made. I'm curious, what particular categories are you seeing selling at a faster rate online? And as you're seeing customers transition to online purchases, where's that velocity highest and which product categories? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: I think that's a question Steve and I will both answer. First of all, we don't talk in specific categories, but they buy across a broad base. There's no one specific category. We've done some things with some pre-shipping offers and minimum purchase offers that have played out very, very well for us in both the pet categories and some other categories. But I would tell you, it's not so much a transition as it is giving the option to our consumers. As I've said before, the Buy Online Pick Up in Store component is incredibly strong and it gives us great confidence that our customers still like shopping our stores. Yes, on some things, they will choose maybe to ship it direct, but I would tell you, it's a combination of both and it's giving them choice. That's what matters. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: The only thing I would add is that the business that we are doing online, a lot of that business are through products that we don't even carry within the four walls of the building. So they may be special order products that are larger sizes. It could be vendors that we've set up that ship direct to customer, dropship. So a lot of that business isn't necessarily business that you would find within the four walls, but it really has \u2013 it indexes pretty high in terms of categories we don't have within the four walls. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : You gave some color on Neighbor's Club. But can you expand on what you're seeing that would indicate that you're gaining share of wallet with your 4 million members or maybe a target group of those members? Just really trying to understand how the customer evolves as a member, whether it be their shopping patterns, how they build a relationship with your store associates. I mean, how do they evolve with the brand as they mature as a member? And then, just quickly on that, as a follow-up, are they generally satisfied with the reward they're getting, right, the seasonal reward, or is that still evolving? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Steve, this is Steve. Great questions. I was just travelling this last week up to Pennsylvania and had a chance to visit a lot of our stores and talk to some of our customers that are part of the program. And generally speaking, it's gone over very well. Now, if you look at our growth in this, we're still relatively immature. I mean, we haven't fully cycled year-over-year all stores scaled. So what I can tell you is, let me give you a few tidbits. Greg mentioned that those stores who have a higher index of transactions of members are performing at a higher rate on a comparable store basis. Another slice of data that I would give you is that I asked the team to go back and look at those customers that started with us and enrolled in October through December of 2015. So it was right when we started the program. And I asked what their purchase history looked like in the first half of 2016 versus the first half of 2017. And you can see an increase in transactions of those same existing customers within the box itself. So that leads us down a path that we can definitely tell that by working toward a reward and getting reminders, it is bringing people in more often. The last thing I would say is how do we feel about the offers that we're giving. The feedback so far has been \u2013 we've tried a variety of different things. We're still testing and learning here. But I can tell you that the opt out rate of people that are part of the program is incredibly tiny. So people still want to be engaged. They still want to be involved. And we still think that this is a big opportunity as we mature into this. We're collecting a lot of data. The next step for us is getting tools to mine it better and then to even personalize those messages more so than we're doing today. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on that point. Can you just remind us what data you are gathering from those members, whether it's e-mails, phone numbers, demographic data, I mean, what information are you gathering? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. So what we do is we ask for phone and we ask for e-mail and then we give them a profile page if they'd like to fill it out and opt in there. So we've got some key data, and that data also, we also collect data if you're not a Neighbor's Club member through reverse of pen (49:07) and getting phone and ZIP capture there. So our attribution rate has continued to grow. And it allows us to really dig deep into what that customer's experience is. And we're also able to tie that back into their experience online and we'll have more information for you guys in the future on that. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi, Michael. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Greg. Your traffic improved from down 1.4% in the first quarter to up 2.2% in the second quarter. You continued to say that C.U.E. was a leading factor in driving the traffic. So did C.U.E. get better from 1Q to 2Q to drive the traffic improvement or was it some other factor that contributed to the improvement? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Michael, this is Steve. First off, don't forget that extra day that we lost. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Right. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: So I want to keep reminding everyone of that... Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, we lost a day. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: ...because one day in a quarter does represent a pretty big portion of the total. So while we did have a reported 2.2%, I believe there was about 60 basis points there and that would have driven up the transaction count higher than what you originally stated. Our C.U.E. business does continue to grow. And as \u2013 I think it was Greg mentioned in his remarks or Kurt, the animal and pet area continues to be a portion of that C.U.E. business that we saw that growth and so we recognized we're a dependable needs supplier and that continues to work well for us. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : But I guess what drove the improvement in the traffic from the first quarter to the second quarter? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, in first quarter, and again, if you go back and look at the months, January was a really tough month for us and a lot of that was weather related. And so, just year-over-year comparable was a very difficult this last year and it wasn't on the animal side of the business that we struggled, it was more on the seasonal side of the business. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And my follow-up question is on the e-comm growth. It sounds like you're seeing some bigger ticket trends online than you are in the stores. Does it just validate that maybe the consumer wants to buy some of the bigger ticket products online and get free shipping, because when they pick it up in store it is free? And does that suggest anything about what you might have to do over the long run and maybe where you're losing some of the traffic to, by virtue of what you're seeing in your particular e-commerce business? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Michael, this is Steve. I don't know if I fully follow that train of thought, because most of the traffic that is driven in our stores is in smaller ticket products, as you can imagine, it's not in big ticket merchandise. While there is a benefit of going online and doing a lot of research, the majority of what we sell in big ticket is done within the four walls and not done online and I think most retailers would tell you that as well. So I don't know if it's necessarily a gap or anything. I think we continue to see growth, as Greg said, across the board on e-comm, including a lot of products we don't even sell in our stores but we get dropship. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Hi, good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi, Brian. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: So a question I have on the comps, so it's very nice to see the bounce back from Q1 to Q2, and then, essentially, no changes to the back half guidance for 2% to 3%. You mentioned earlier, because some of these headwinds we've been talking about for a while may be going away, but the question I have is how should we think about \u2013 I mean what should the underlying \u2013 what should the company be comping normalized? I know this is a difficult question, but if we \u2013 I assume it's higher than 2% to 3%? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: I have to get out my black in my eight ball and kind of turn it around and ask you that question, Brian. But I would tell you that we've always said a 3% to 5% in that range was where we would target, okay, as a comp, and probably high single, if you add new stores in total company. So our feeling about Q2, it was moving more toward the normal of where I would consider we need to be. If you take the extra day and put it back in, it's 2.8%, pretty close to 3%, so we're saying we're getting more back to that normal, what I would call between 3% to 5%. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: Okay. Then, so I guess a follow-up to that, what headwinds are still out there then that are keeping you out of that 3% to 5% even though you've gotten closer to the lower end of it? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Michael (sic) [Brian], this is Kurt. I mean a couple of things and we've talked about these, but we've not seen the return of the tailwinds on the inflation. So at this point, as I mentioned, the back half of 2017 we anticipate continued deflation. Those years where you saw the benefit of the inflation, we don't have those yet and we don't have signs that those return in 2018 at this point. The oil markets have stabilized, moderated a bit, and so that's a positive in regards to how Texas, Oklahoma, are performing. But we're not at a point where those type of conditions are tailwinds for us. So those would be some things that we certainly would be looking for to get to a higher comp rate. Operator : And our next question will come from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi, Peter. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I've got a couple of \u2013 two questions just on e-commerce. So Greg, you've mentioned you guys have extended some free shipping offers, minimum shipping offers with pet food and we saw a pickup with the footwear in the quarter. Are you seeing any uptick in those specific categories that make you rethink your current shipping offers are maybe getting a bit more aggressive on the e-commerce offer? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, we tried several price tiers. We tried free, we tried $29 minimum and we tried $49 minimum. And let me assure you that our customer had really very little difference between $29 and $49, so we gravitated back to the $49 level, that seems to be working just fine and we're seeing growth. We're very selective on what we do on the free side, particularly if we can gear it more toward our own brands where there is a much richer margin and that's something that Steve and his team have been working through. But I think as you'll note, the mix of our business is still coming so heavily through Buy Online Pick Up in Store is a tremendous advantage for us. That continues to show you that because of our stores' proximity to where our customers live and the fact that they're probably on their way by our store, toward our store to do other shopping, they still choose to make that trip, and I don't believe that's going to change. So I think it's a combination of both that works. We don't always have to give free ship. We can do it with a respectable minimum and our customers seem to respond. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, great. That's actually a nice segue to my next question is that Buy Online Pick Up in Store. So it ramped very quickly here. I guess, do you feel like you might be leaving some sales on the table as a result of out of stocks? I know I think in the past, you mentioned that some of the orders from Buy Online Pickup in Store can be rather large. And furthermore, as Buy Online Pick Up service presumably gets bigger, should that have any impact on overall margin? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Peter, this is Steve. No, I'll start with the second question first. If anything, the margin impact is a plus, because people are coming in to pick it up rather than having it shipped to their place. So from that perspective, we don't see any negative impact overall on the margin side of things. On Buy Online Pick Up in Store, in general, I mean, our in stocks year-over-year are better than they were a year ago. We made some key investments in some of the categories that were under $20 that we felt would benefit us overall and we were able to do that with very little total inventory investment. As you heard Kurt say, I think we were over about 1% for the quarter. In terms of our concern about losing business, I actually think that this is probably benefiting us in the long haul. And so that's not an overall concern at this point. Operator : And our next question will come from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot and good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Afternoon (58:04), Seth. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My question is around the promotion and pricing environment. Can you give us a little bit more color year-over-year on where the promotional intensity was and where you saw opportunities to take price or invest in price? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. So this is Steve. I think relatively speaking, our promotional cadence was pretty similar. I think we did have an ad roll into the second quarter that we didn't have in Q1. But outside of that, there was nothing really material or substantial during the quarter that would have had any real impact. And as we look forward, we don't see any significant changes in what we intend to do either when it comes to promotion. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. And as it relates to pricing specifically, I think you talked about... Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, yeah. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: ...the opportunities that helped your margin a little bit. Can you give us a little bit more color category wise where those were... Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: ...and yeah, that would be great. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Good question. So one of the benefits of having invested in a pricing tool years ago was it allows us to look at elasticity across all categories. And we really took advantage of that system during the quarter and looked at the four walls and looked at the different regions of the country. I mean, this wasn't a one stroke brush across the entire chain. So it was very scientific in what we did. The impact on elasticity, we didn't show a whole lot of negative impact as far as losing share and gaining rate. So based on some of the learning and the testing that we did, we rolled it out to more stores. And I think that's some of the lift that we experienced toward the back end of the quarter. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. And we anticipate that continuing through the back half of the year, right? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, I think that's what gives us a little bit more confidence in talking about the stabilization, as Kurt mentioned, toward the back half and not maybe what we experienced in Q1. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to dive into a little bit the longer term margin profile of the company on how we should frame it. I know you guys talked a little bit about kind of a step-up in SG&A spend, we're also shifting the business a little bit more to e-commerce. Buy Online Pick Up in Store is good, 55%, but you have the other side. And then, also, with the stuff that's available widely online and a lot of your stuff isn't, there does seem to still be some price discrepancy where you're priced a little bit higher. So I was wondering, as you guys frame it, how should we think of margins kind of as we go forward and shift your business on a longer term basis? Is it just going to be a natural pressure on the business on the margin side? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Scott, this is Kurt. I would start with saying that we don't get too far into beyond the current year, maybe a little bit the near term. I would tell you that for the near term that we would expect the investments that we referred to as on the expense side, to have some of those continue to exist. On the gross margin side of the product, we continue to balance the different levers that we've got on rate, mix and driving market share. So I'd say the short-term, there's pretty much consistency between 2017 and, say, 2018. Beyond that, I think it's too far out reaching to try to give additional guidance at this point. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: And the only thing I would add to that, Scott, is that we have a list of opportunities in terms of margin improvement that we can take advantage of and I think about a third of our business was in exclusive brands or private brands and sales that we did in the second quarter. We still see more upside, more opportunity there. We've just recently added to our team in strategic sourcing and we believe that there's more opportunity to lower cost there. And then, finally, as we grow as an organization, my challenge back to the merchandising team is that we should be able to leverage our position, in a lot of cases with the branded folks out there today, to really be able to lower our overall costs. So there are a number of things I think we can do that could offset any of the potential headwinds that you mentioned. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : And as a follow-up to what you guys said \u2013 I appreciate the detail \u2013 is when you look at like some of the C.U.E. products, some of the clothing that's \u2013 the branded items that are available in multiple channels, a lot online, where do you think you're priced and do you think you need to make some investments there? And that's my follow-up. I appreciate it. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Scott, this is Steve. What I would tell you is that we look at pricing all the time, whether it be in brick-and-mortar competitors or what we're seeing online. And we've got categories of merchandise that we stand for that, quite frankly, we've got to make sure in those categories and in those items that we're very competitive. And so, we use our pricing tools and dynamic pricing to make sure that we're managing that accordingly. So what I would tell you is this, are we going to be the best price on 15,000 SKUs inside our box every single day against every single competitor online? Probably not. Where we're going to stand for something, we will be priced right. Operator : And our next question will come from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. I try to as a follow-up on a few of the questions, thinking about the operating margin outlook, back in February at the investors meeting, we were looking for 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point annual improvement. But is it fair to say that given the investments that are going to continue that 2018 that we probably should not expect any kind of meaningful improvement until 2019? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Dan, this is Kurt. I would tell you that some of the investments that we talked about in 2017 that will exist in 2018. Near term, operating margin may be more flat and you're close on, if we're reaching out and looking ahead, it would be at least 2019 perhaps to start to see some operating margin growth. But even that far out, it's hard to \u2013 and don't want to try to give any sort of guidance beyond that. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Do you think that the thesis for Tractor Supply is more of a top-line story, going forward, in that future cost of goods sold savings would probably have to be shared with the customer in an effort to grow market share? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Great question, Dan. I think there's couple angles to that. One is that we continue to share today with our customer the benefits of our size and scale. And our pricing, generally on most of the products we have in our store are priced right every day, as you know, we're not a high-low retailer. The second thing is on the share basis, in certain categories of businesses where Steve and the team have really built a strong substantial base of our own brands, we continue to see more and more growth there. Those should over time continue to add to some margin improvement, but you talked about the sharing, we'll probably give some of that back, when we look at some of the things we'll be doing with probably the direct-to-customer side of the business. I seriously do not believe that that direct-to-customer business will ever outweigh the Buy Online Pick Up side of the business. I said this earlier in my remarks that ours is the store that our team members and our customers have this bond and this relationship where they like to come in our stores and shop. They like to talk to our team members for that seasoned advice. And so, we see that through when we turned on Buy Online Pick Up in Store. So we're going to share back with the consumer to make sure that they're getting a good value for their money. But I don't think that we have to go out and \u2013 we always use this terminology, do you own your customer or do you rent your customer. We like to own our customers through giving them great values, great service, being in stock and being available to them, whether we're close to them with a physical store or being available to them 24/7 online. That's how we believe we'll win. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, just one real quick question. On the same-store sales performance, we're measuring that two different ways in the quarter, right? One is on the calendar you have this year and one is adjusted so that the weeks match up the same and the prior years. Inside your company, do you believe that your same-store sales are up 1% or 2.2%? When you're evaluating results, which metric did you use? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Dan, this is Kurt. So I think I understand the question. Just maybe clarify the reference to 1% versus 2.2%. Is the 1% you're referring to last year? Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Maybe \u2013 so there was a week difference in the calendar, right, year-over-year? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Right, right, right. Yes, so... Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So which calendar do you use internally in evaluating your performance? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Got you. We use the 1.1% last year as the base up against that 2.2% reported number. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : In looking at the spring seasonal strength you're seeing so far extending into the third quarter, can you talk about how broad that is? Is it just outdoor power equipment? Is it some of the consumables stuff? And with that strength, why aren't you a little more positive on the comps in the third quarter and second half? Is there an offset going on? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Chuck, first of all, this is Steve. I would tell you that the season has extended in a lot of the spring seasonal product. We feel that there is some momentum here that's building. But we also want to be reasonable in terms of what our comp guidance and future forecasts looks like. And so, over the course of the time I've been with Tractor, we've laid out plans and we've always worked hard to achieve those. And I think the work that Kurt and his team have done, as we look forward, is a reasonable comparable store sales target. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Are there any tougher categories that are sort of offsetting the stronger ones that are extending? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, what I would say is that the spring seasonal business becomes less of a total part of our business as the quarter continues. September is a five-week fiscal quarter for us, and we certainly don't get a whole lot of spring seasonal business then. So while we've got a little bit of traction now, it's hard for us to gauge what August and September are going to look like. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Got it. And how about \u2013 I'll finish with this question, how about competitive promotional activity? How would you gauge that in the current economic environment? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Again, this is Steve. I would tell you, I don't see a whole lot of change in brick-and-mortar. Our existing competitors, we try to keep an eye on that, and I haven't seen a whole lot there. I think online is always a different story and there's so many different categories that so many different people are in. We try to keep an eye on that, but that's ever-changing and it's incredibly dynamic. So I wouldn't want to make a standard blanket comment on that other than that it continues to change and we continue to keep an eye on it and make sure that we're doing what we need to do not to lose share. Operator : And our next question will come from David Magee of SunTrust. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Hi, everybody. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi, Dave. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Hi, Dave. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just a quick one from me. I'm thinking about the store format over the next 12, 18 months, and you mentioned earlier resets continuing in the store and I'm curious what departments might get the most attention, big ticket, apparel, whatever it might be. Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Kurt, you want to take that? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: He's talking about store sets. He wants to know what store sets. David, clarify the question. You're asking what are some of the department store sets that are going to be some things driving the business as we go forward? David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, as you look around the store, what areas, when you mention resets, get the most attention? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Got it. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: I apologize for that, David. Well, first of all, I would tell you that the box has really evolved over the course of the time that I've certainly been with it. And it's evolved over the last five to 10 years as well. And we've talked a lot about the C.U.E. business continuing to drive the overall transactions and traffic. We're going to continue to put the pedal down there. We believe there's more upside in what we're doing in a lot of the C.U.E. businesses. So in the back half, for example, we're going to go back and revisit our pet business. There's some sub-brands out there that we believe will continue to add growth. In feed, we know that there's more of a regional play that we can get into there. We're going to be looking at our oil and lubricant categories as they continue to grow. And over time, we're going to have to look at the totality of the box. Now, it will probably be the same size as it is today, but we're going to revisit the space allocation that we give to certain categories and as time change and as business change, there may be some categories that would be better off at special order and we can improve the level of productivity of the inventory and drive our overall turnover up. So right now, the team is working diligently on this and we'll probably have more to share on the next conference call. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Steve. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Operator : And our next question will come from Adam Sindler of Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, good afternoon, everyone. How you doing? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Good. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. So I just want to talk a little bit about expenses as well. It looks like D&A was up quite a bit in the quarter, maybe about 21% in dollars. Is that simply due to some of the online initiatives that you're working on, investing in software and things of that nature? And if so, should we expect that to continue throughout the year? And then, looking out a little bit, should we continue to expect SG&A total operating expense dollars to grow in the sort of 9% range? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Adam, this is Kurt. First, let me \u2013 I'll address the depreciation question. Depreciation grew in the first half about 19%. And as we look ahead, I think the key thing is there's a distinct difference in regards to cycling or not cycling yet Petsense. So you've got growth in that number in Petsense included this year and not. And when you factor that out, the gap is a little bit different. We're estimating about a 16%, 17% growth rate in depreciation for the year, and we'll start to cycle Petsense in the fourth quarter. And so, the second half of the year will have a little bit more investment that half last year than the first half. So the compares are a little bit closer. So you'll probably be at about a 15% to 16% depreciation growth rate in the second half of the year. Biggest difference in the comparables is really the Petsense with, yes, some additional investment in our strategic initiatives. But the size of that, the gap, is not an indicator of the impact of the initiatives that we're talking about. They're driving 200 or 300 basis points maybe in growth rate of depreciation in the year. And we'll see the growth rate next year probably in the high single-digit range, a little bit ahead of the sales growth rate, but we'll continue to manage the levers that we've got to address the spend in there and keep the growth rate as close in line to the sales growth as possible. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's total operating expense dollars you're referring to there, correct? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just real quickly to follow up, average order value on the Buy Online Pick Up in Store you said was favorable. Is that due to just a different mix of product, more items per basket? What's driving the delta there? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, a lot of it is mix. We added a lot of different categories this past year and we saw the benefit of doing so. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So a lot (01:15:52) about the calendar shifts. And I think last quarter you had said you expected about $15 million of seasonal sales to shift into 2Q. I'm wondering how that played out. And I realize you're also cycling what I think you had sized as about a $25 million weather related shift to the second quarter of last year. But was the $15 million pretty much in line? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Stephen, this is Kurt. I just want to reiterate, we did not emphasize a seasonal shift from first quarter to second quarter. We indicated at the end of first quarter that we certainly saw softness in demand in the seasonal product, and there was about $15 million of variance perhaps in March year-over-year. We did not see enough indication in regards to timing that we were indicating in anything that there was a seasonal shift. I would say the only shift might be the timing of Easter, and what we expected from pre-Easter in prior year first quarter to second quarter shifted pretty consistently, but that was in our plan. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of thinking through potentially the extension of the spring selling season into 3Q, are you able to put some numbers around that how meaningful you think that could be? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: No. At this moment, it wouldn't be accurate for me to get into that. I mean, until we get through the entire season, we won't really have a good read on it. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's fine. Just lastly, just higher level, I was wondering if you could comment on kind of the health of your consumer and how that's maybe being factored into your outlook, what you're seeing in their spending habits, et cetera. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: This is Greg. What I can tell you, and I was also in stores quite a bit this quarter, particularly I was down in the Texas markets, and that consumer base, I think, feels and believes that the economy there is stabilizing, so their spend levels are starting to come back. I think in general our consumer is feeling as if business may be as normal for right now. I do believe that some of the first quarter issue could have been that the fact that we came out of an election and people were waiting just to see what was going to happen, if anything. And I think once we got through that cycle, second quarter needs surfaced and people came back out and shopped. So we don't see any big change in how our tender is coming through. I like the footsteps. I like the fact that we were able to maintain our business in big ticket. So I feel good that the consumer is feeling comfortable right now. Hopefully, nothing else in Washington can sway them the other direction. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot, Greg. Good luck in the back half. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: A housekeeping question and then a bigger picture question. From a housekeeping standpoint, I'm trying to just make sense of what sounds like a strong second quarter and a good second half, with the magnitude of the earnings reduction relative to 90 days ago. Can you just square those two points, please? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Sure. When we baked in assumptions and looked at the first half and created the guidance for the year adjustments on our guidance, as we mentioned, top-line comp sales fairly consistent. There is some reduced new store sales due to the timing of the opening of new stores. But when you see on the expense side, a couple key things in regards to the back half. We certainly benefit from expense reduction and some favorable items last year. Do factor in the 53rd week as I mentioned. And we have more cautiousness in the revised guidance on gross margin rate versus the 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point improvement in the original guidance. There are \u2013 additionally on the tax rate, I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that the tax rate has increased 50 basis points. I do want to point that out that we do not expect to get the 50-basis-point benefit that we had in the original plan, due to the lack of stock option activity. So when you factor those results in as well as the trends on SG&A in the first half, I think you can get more to the 80-basis-point to 100-basis-point deleverage on SG&A in the back half for the year. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: The sales guidance in 2Q, were sales where you thought it's going to be or have you expected a better sales result? I mean, the numbers sounds good, but (01:20:51). Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Eric, if I could ask you to repeat that. It was fading out and I did not get much of the question. This is Kurt. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Sure. Yeah, just the reduction in the sales guidance today versus 90 days ago, it seems like 2Q and the second half were where you thought they were going to be. So just trying to square those two. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Sure, this is Kurt. I would just tell you without a lot of specifics, while the first half missed on both the top-line and bottom line, most of that was in the first quarter, but I would also say that second quarter, the top-line sales results while good, there was also both top and bottom line slight miss on the second quarter as well. And then, I do want to remind you with the \u2013 there are non-comp new store selling weeks that were baked into our original guidance that we had to adjust based on timing of new stores. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: And then, from a big picture standpoint, I'm interested in (01:21:50) the opportunity in C.U.E. and execution in C.U.E. has been great for the company historically. But looking out with an evolving consumer, is it your expectation more of that will move online and will be bought online and picked up at Tractor Supply or how do you view the C.U.E. evolution with your customer and how the stores where online would fit into that? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Great question, Eric. And we are looking at a number of things. Not only polling our customers as to their expectations, but doing some testing here in the next 6 to 12 months with some delivery formats from store, from third party, from our own distribution hubs to understand if we make certain things available online, first of all, can we drive higher levels of volume and gain more share and, secondly, what would the cost be. So you're going to see us doing some testing over time. It's not complete yet, but we'll have a better picture in the next 6 to 7 to 12 months. Operator : And our next question will come from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups from some of the other commentary. So I guess I understand on the expense side of things, like, some of what you've outlined. But what would you say is, again, I guess incrementally different? Is it the fact that you're spending a little more on labor for the second half than you anticipated in the first half of the year to service people or is it you're accelerating some e-commerce investment that's driving that SG&A level a little bit higher? I'm just trying to get a better sense of it. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Joe, this is Kurt. First, we can walk you through the adjustments from our original plan. I would tell you that the key factors, again, are the gross margin rate is softer than the original plan while a slight benefit. On the expense side, yes, we are going to invest on the second half additional payroll. The incentive comp is a strong headwind to go up against. We called it out last year that incentive comp was a benefit, and then, after that, it's just some of the other expense management that we had. Those are the items that differ between the original 60 basis points to 80 basis points deleverage on SG&A to more of an 80 basis points to 100 basis points. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much. And then, the other on, wanted to ask again on the big ticket items. I understand you're shifting a little bit more online. But the big ticket has been relatively soft for the past year or so and I'm wondering it seems like we've had several quarters of unfavorable weather that's kind of gone against you, maybe snow blowers not selling because there was too mild in winter and things like that. But how much, if you could bucket it, would be weather versus demand versus maybe even just competition, like, do you see share loss in any of those categories? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. This is Steve. I think it's a good question. I mean we look at the business in a lot of different ways and we had some pretty significant benefits or tailwinds over the course of time and I'll use for example safes. I'll use log splitters which is a great business for Tractor because of the customer base that we serve, maybe less of an extent of snow blowers, just because it's a smaller part of our total business. But there are some seasonal impacts to a lot of the big ticket things that we talked about. We've done a lot of things to offset some of that. We brought in new lineup of trailers. We have modified what we've done in reset categories such as pressure washers and generators, and we've seen the benefit of those things and that's helped offset what have been actually a bit more pain for us. So at the end of the day, I don't know if it's a matter of losing share necessarily and it's just more of a matter of, quite frankly, some of the weather impacts that we've had and some of the tailwinds that we experienced for quite a window of time. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Greg for any additional or closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Thank you, operator. Great questions today. We thank all of you for your continued support of Tractor Supply and Petsense. And we look forward to speaking with you again regarding our third quarter financial results. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today with me are Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Chief Financial Officer. We are very pleased with the overall performance of our business in the third quarter. Sales were strong throughout the quarter, and broad-based across all of our major product categories and geographic regions. Moderate temperatures and higher moisture levels throughout the summer months led to an extended spring and summer selling season, and our team did an exceptional job of positioning our inventories to capture those sales. We experienced strong demand for C.U.E., seasonal products and big-ticket products, and with our supply chain capabilities, we were able to flow inventory back into our stores to address the increased customer demand for product. While deflation did moderate somewhat in the quarter, it has continued to be a headwind in several key categories. And in many of the energy markets we serve, we have seen our business improve, but by no means have all of these markets fully returned to prior sales levels. For the third quarter, comparable store sales increased 6.6%, with store transaction counts up 5%, and average ticket up 1.5%. Our online traffic was strong with unique visits up 20% and 66% of all visits to our tractorsupply.com site continue to come through a mobile device. We did experience a marginal sales lift from the hurricanes late in the quarter, and we estimate this added about 120 basis points to comparable store sales. But more importantly, we are extremely proud of the way our team members and our vendor community worked together to provide needed emergency response products to the hurricane impacted communities. Team members in our stores, distribution centers, and store support center worked tirelessly to help our local communities in their greatest time of need. We believe it is this type of neighborly helping hand that makes Tractor Supply a special company, and strengthens our customer's affinity to the Tractor Supply brand. Our customers have trust that Tractor Supply will provide their everyday basic products for living the rural lifestyle, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to better meet their evolving needs. Our stores, our people and our systems are all critical components that enable us to serve our customers, and we continue to be committed to our goal of digitizing our business by closely linking the physical and digital storefronts into one seamless shopping environment for them. We call this our ONETractor initiative. Our Buy Online Pick Up in Store and Drop Ship programs continue to build momentum and resonate with customers with roughly 75% of online orders being picked up in our stores in the third quarter. Additionally, the average order size for a Buy Online Pick Up in Store order remains significantly higher than the company average. And our customer data indicates that Buy Online Pick Up in Store is particularly popular for larger projects and difficult to transport items, such as fencing products that require a larger number of components to complete the job. Buy Online Pick Up in Store allows our customers the option to research and select the products they need, that know that their order will be ready for pick up at a store close by, and thus saving them time. Also, our Neighbor's Club customer regards program continues to be very popular. Enrollment in the program has exceeded our expectations, and we finished the quarter with over 5 million members. Our Neighbor's Club members are some of our best and most engaged customers, and while we are still in the early stages of rolling out the benefits of this program, we will leverage this customer data over time to strengthen our relationships and refine our personalized communications with this customer. Now, there's two other technology initiatives that we continue to test, and we believe could be meaningful longer term. They are mobile POS and stockyard. Mobile POS is an in-store initiative that allows our associates to find information, locate product, and check inventory in surrounding stores, and then process the sale through a mobile device. Our team members have embraced the technology and by using mobile POS are making the shopping trip easier for our customers. Stockyard, another store-level initiative that merges our online and in-store capabilities, allows our store team members and customers to tap into a much wider assortment of products, utilizing our vendor's inventories. This extends our digital footprint and gives our team members and customers access to merchandise not normally carried in our stores. This is particularly helpful when a customer is looking for a unique or a hard-to-find item that may be make or model specific. The team member and the customer can research the sought-after item on the kiosk, quickly address an immediate need, saving them both time. Now, a little over a year ago, we acquired Petsense, and we remain pleased with the opportunities for this business. While immaterial to our overall results, Petsense stores generated positive comps and double-digit total revenue growth for the quarter. We have spent the past year gaining a better understanding of the business, and are working to improve the model while integrating back-of-house functions where possible. Utilizing the Tractor Supply test-to-learn methodology, one area of focus has been on the development of exclusive brands. Through this effort, we are launching an exclusive brand of premium dog and cat food in Petsense stores this month, and it's labeled True Source. Petsense will also launch an e-commerce site late in the fourth quarter for purchasing online, and Buy Online and Pick Up in Store will be available sometime in spring of 2018. We continue to believe that the rural pet market is an under-served market with fragmented competition and significant growth opportunities, and we are prudently investing in people, processes and technology to develop and grow this business for the longer term. So, let me summarize. We are delighted with our overall third quarter results, and our teams did a terrific job capitalizing on the extended summer selling season. We know our customers look to us for their everyday basic needs and we are making timely investments in our business to better serve them. With a loyal and growing customer base and continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts, we believe we are well-positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. I want to thank all of our Tractor Supply and Petsense team members around the country for all that you do. You are the driving force \u2013 those who serve our customers and execute our business plan every day. Now I'll turn the call over to Kurt to review our third quarter financial results. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales increased 11.6% to $1.72 billion, resulting in net income of $91.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 6.6% versus a reported decrease of 0.6% last year. As a reminder, our Q3 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's third quarter comparable store sales decrease would have been 1.1%. As Greg mentioned, comps were positive across all geographic regions and major product categories, and benefited from an extended summer selling season. Sales also benefited later in the quarter from the sale of emergency response products related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. And we estimate this benefited same-store sales by approximately 120 basis points. As a result, sales were strong in all three months of the quarter, with July being the highest comp increase. Comparable store transaction count increased 5%. This compares to prior-year's reported 0.5% increase. Comparable store transaction count increased across all regions of the country, and was driven principally by strength in our C.U.E. items, along with strength in seasonal categories and emergency response-related products, as well. Average comp ticket increased 1.5% compared to prior-year's reported 1.1% decrease. This quarter's increase was driven principally by the mix of goods, as well as the strength of big-ticket sales, partially offset by deflation. Big ticket overall comp was above chain average, principally driven by strong sales of generators, as well as strength in utility vehicles and fuel-handling items. We estimate deflation impacted average ticket by approximately 30 basis points. As a reminder, Petsense store sales are not yet reflected in our reported comparable store sales results, as those stores will be included in the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which increased 20 basis points to 34.9%. We were pleased with how the team managed margin during the quarter. Direct product margin was positive to prior year, with rate being the primary driver. The rate improvement was driven principally through strong inventory management and strategic sourcing initiatives. Additionally, we were less promotional during the quarter, as the extended summer selling season resulted in strong seasonal sell through. The mix of merchandise did not have a significant impact on direct product margin, as the strong comp sales performance was broad based across all product categories. The unfavorable impact of strong generator sales was offset by the favorable impact of strong sales of truck accessories, tools and hardware, which are above-margin categories. Freight, however, negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories, higher average fuel costs, and, to a lesser extent, growth in our online business. Petsense provided a slight benefit to gross margin, as these stores operate at a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores. For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 80 basis points to 26.3% of sales compared to 25.5% of sales in the prior-year's quarter. The deleverage was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and additional investments in key strategic areas. Incentive compensation expense represented approximately 40 basis points of the deleverage in the quarter. The strong performance in this year's third quarter versus last year's third quarter drove the higher incentive compensation expense. By comparison, incentive expense declined approximately 60 basis points as a percentage of sales in last year's third quarter from softer sales and earnings. The remaining increase in the SG&A rate was driven primarily by investments in payroll and other strategic initiatives to drive customer service and long-term growth, as well as the addition of the Petsense SG&A, which tends to operate at a higher expense ratio than Tractor Supply. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 36.4% compared to 36.5% last year. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had a cash balance of $70 million and $510 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $56 million and $295 million in outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter, we acquired 1.4 million shares for $78.5 million through our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have acquired a total of 5.2 million shares for $326.6 million. The reported consolidated average inventory per-store decline of 9.2% includes the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense, average inventory levels per store decreased 1.9% against last year's third quarter. We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter as well as the management of our working capital. Now, with respect to our outlook, based on the trends and results in the third quarter, we're updating our outlook for the full-year fiscal 2017. We expect full-year sales to range from $7.17 billion to $7.22 billion, comparable store sales increase between 1.7% and 2.2%, and net income to range from $416 million to $421 million, and earnings per diluted share to be $3.25 to $3.29. Assumed in this guidance is an operating margin decline of 70 basis points to 90 basis points, a tax rate of 36.5%, average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 128 million to 128.4 million and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We expect to hit our new store targets of 100 Tractor Supply stores and 25 Petsense stores, and continue to be pleased with new store productivity. With respect to the fourth quarter, we experienced warmer than normal weather conditions during the first two weeks of the quarter. However, where the weather has turned cooler, we have begun to see increased demand for cold weather seasonal products. We believe we are well-positioned heading into the fall and winter season with a solid plan to drive winter seasonal merchandise when the colder weather arrives. As a reminder, adjusting for the week shift, the fourth quarter is cycling prior-year positive 3.8% comparable store sales results. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter, and the full year to be approximately 30 basis points. With respect to gross margin, we will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share. We expect headwinds from both product mix and transportation costs in the fourth quarter, and therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter in comparison to prior year. With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we will continue to drive operating efficiencies to offset incremental investments in key strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points. Factors to consider are : first, we expect to continue to invest payroll in our stores, distribution centers, and customer solution center to drive strong customer-service levels. This investment reflects incremental hours and, to a lesser extent, higher average wage rates compared to prior year. We're also cycling favorable medical and worker's compensation-related costs in the prior year. Depreciation expense is expected to grow 11% to 12% over the prior year, resulting from our key strategic investments in technology and supply chain enhancements. Additionally, we are cycling the prior year 53rd week, which benefited last year's fourth quarter expense leverage. We will of course provide our initial outlook for 2018 on our year-end conference call, but in keeping with our past practices, let me provide you with some considerations for your modeling into next year. We expect to finish the construction of our New York distribution center in Q3 2018 and begin servicing stores in late fourth quarter. We are forecasting that related pre-opening expenses and incremental operating expenses for this distribution center to increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis, impacting earnings per share by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, with most of the impact in the second half of the year. Also, should we achieve our targeted results in 2018, higher incentive compensation could raise SG&A and impact earnings by $0.06 to $0.08. We expect some moderate impact from higher-wage inflation at both the stores and distribution centers due to pressures from both state regulations, as well as competition. Additionally, we anticipate continued headwind from freight expense due to growth in C.U.E. and other more freight-intensive products, higher average transportation costs and growth in our online business. Over the past two years, we have invested in several key initiatives to position the company for long-term growth. We have managed the business and related investment spending to absorb these costs in our financial model while delivering solid bottom-line growth. Therefore, as we continue to invest in long term growth of the company, our goal is to execute these incremental investments while managing the financial impact to enable us to deliver earnings growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Our first question comes from David Magee with SunTrust. Your line is open. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes, hi. Thank you, and a nice quarter, guys. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, David. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit more about just the transportation issue, and maybe a bit more color about what type of items cost you more? I know you're investing a lot in improving the sort of the flow through of that, but is that something that is likely to peak next year, do you think, and starts to decline thereafter? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, David, this is Kurt, and good question. On the transportation side what we're seeing are a number of factors. The growth in C.U.E. continues to have pressure on the transportation freight expense as those items, bulkier, heavier commodity items have a higher freight rate to them. Additionally, we certainly were able to capitalize on opportunities to sell certain items that are bulkier and big product that have a larger freight charge to them. That was part of the third quarter. That is a little bit more specific to third and perhaps fourth quarter. I will tell you that what we're seeing in addition to that is on the oil pricing and the cost of fuel, we saw an increase in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter we expect to have higher average fuel costs. And then lastly, both domestically and internationally we are seeing increases in transportation costs, and those items we expect to carry into next year. David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that, and I guess \u2013 and secondly, if you could give a little color about what you're seeing with regard to your competition online and any price movement online that might be surprising either way to you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Steve. We're keeping a close eye on it. What I can tell you is that no different than we do in our stores, we've got different categories of merchandise, whether it be items we're very competitive on, items that are more convenience and some that are balanced. And I've seen a lot of reports out there kind of trying to project where Tractor is relative to their pricing competitiveness online. What I can tell you is is that the vast majority of our business is done in stores. And the store brands that we carry, we feel really good about where we're at online. We do have about an additional 70,000 items that are online that we don't have in the stores, and we're constantly going through and checking those items, but those items don't have a significant impact on our revenue. So, again, I would tell you we feel pretty good about where we're at. We feel good on the consumable side of our business and a lot of the big ticket, especially the products that we carry in our stores. Operator : We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon, Simeon. How are you? Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good. How are you doing? Just a follow up for Kurt. I don't think you mentioned it explicitly in, I guess, the preview guidance for 2018. I think you mentioned that SG&A will be up and you mentioned a couple of the headwinds to gross margins. And I didn't know if there's offsets to it or if what you're implying is that overall margin could be under pressure? And then at what sort of comp rate is it normalized? I think the 3%, 3.5% or so camp rate, is that how you're thinking about comp growth relative to the other plans you laid out? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Simeon. And I mentioned this briefly on the last call, too. When we look ahead to 2018, first I'd say with fourth quarter still ahead of us, and right now we're heavily into building the budget and the forecast for 2018, I can't necessarily get into too much detail. But I'd tell you that when we look at 2018 on the gross margin side, we do see the expectation that freight headwinds to continue into 2018. As we said before, 2018 will continue to be a year we invest in our long-term growth initiatives. So for the items that I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, I believe there's SG&A headwinds, as I mentioned. And I would say at this point, we would expect to see operating margin for next year have somewhat of a slight decline. A little bit early to say. We'll have more information as we end Q4. At this point, looking out, I can probably just tell you that we're somewhat realistic and cautious on operating margin and would expect to see some slight decline. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for the color. And good luck in Q4. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Atul Maheswari - UBS Securities LLC : Good evening. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. See, your guidance implies that the fourth quarter comp would be in the 1% range at the midpoint. I know you're lapping significantly comparisons in the fourth quarter, so what gives you confidence that this guidance will be achievable? Do you need favorable weather to comp at that level, or do you believe your initiatives will help you meet this guidance, even if the weather is not very cooperative? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, it's a good question. On the fourth quarter, I'd say the couple of assumptions are that we do see strength in the core of the business. And that's a key part of our assumption. The fourth quarter is a quarter where weather can heavily impact the performance of it. So, the assumed guidance range assumes somewhat of a normal fourth quarter, and expecting continued strength in our C.U.E. product. Any favorable weather or change in weather that's unfavorable could heavily impact the performance of the top-line sales. Atul Maheswari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And as my follow-up, can you quantify as to how much the milder summer helped your comp in the third quarter? And also if there were any geographies of noticeable strength? Can you quantify how much those regions comped above the company average? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Kurt, and the best I can tell you is that, as we mentioned, the strongest month of the quarter was July, and that's where we saw the extended summer-selling season. And I don't have specifics on exactly the impact to the overall top line. I would tell you that it was beneficial to July and it was not a strong significant impact to the overall comps. It was probably somewhere around 100 basis points to something less than that. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Ah, yes, hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on the quarter, as well. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Adam. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Of course. So, the first question I wanted to ask was on mobile and the strength you're seeing there. And then, potentially, sort of tying that into Neighbor's Club. One sort of segment that's always eluded you has been the aware non-shopper and the non-aware non-shopper. And I remember, maybe, several quarters ago, you gave an example of someone looking to buy a trailer. They'd never shopped there. They came in and bought one. As you're looking at the mobile orders, and as you're looking at your Neighbor's Club enrollment, what type of overlap is there between those two? And, I guess, sort of the question is are you seeing that some of these mobile customers are new customers, and then they're signing up for Neighbor's Club, I guess is one. And then secondly, sort of similar to the last question, could you sort of maybe discuss how much confidence you've gotten from running longer hours, now that you are doing that? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay, yes, sure. Let me start. This is Steve. The first question you ask about mobile, Neighbor's Club and tying the two together, here's what I can tell you. Our customers have always used mobile and we are getting more traction from mobile. As Greg said, we've got about 20% of the growth of our web is from unique customers. So, what we're seeing is more customers come into the fold that are relatively new to our site, and probably new to our brand. A lot of that has to do with a lot of the SEM marketing that we're doing out there, what we're going in social media space. And I do believe that's actually bringing more folks into the fold, or at least introducing them into the brand. Now, in terms of whether or not they're new to Neighbor's Club, that's a little harder for us to understand, because the Neighbor's Club program is new. And now that we're able to have as many as 5 million members, we're able to now go back through and check with those members to see if they're using mobile, desktop, or how they're coming to us, whether that be in-store or not. So, we'll probably know more once we start cycling more of this. At this point, Adam, that's the best I can give you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Adam, this is Greg to talk to you about the longer hours of operation. When we made a slight change back in the latter part of first, second quarter to stay open until 9 :00, that was due to customer request. They were coming to us in droves saying, hey, listen, I need to be able to get to your store after 8 :00 and pick things up. It's still light outside. I've still got work to do. Why are you guys closing at 8 :00? And we had, I can't tell you, how many customers coming to us through email and through social media saying, why are you closing so early? Many of our competition stay open until 9 :00, some stay open even until 10 :00. So, we made the adjustment based upon that. My belief is is that we may have seen a slight uptick, but generally speaking, it was business that probably would have come to us the following day or morning. I think we just made it more convenient for our customers to stay open an extra hour. And it cost us a little bit in labor, but it was the right thing to do from a customer-service standpoint. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks a lot and congrats on the great quarter. First question, just on the C.U.E. categories. It sounds like C.U.E. continues to outperform. Is there a way to break that down further and to see if there are particular categories within that, that are leading the growth? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth, this is Steve. What I can tell you is we talk a lot about C.U.E. being across the four walls. But if I were to give you any indication on the product categories that did perform, we continue to see growth in those categories that continue to fuel our business. We did a reset in the livestock feed category in Q3, and we believe that that added some value. We localized a number of assortments, brought in some new SKUs and we continue to see growth in organic livestock feed. In addition to that, we did a reset in our pet food segment. And I know there's a lot of concern, a lot of buzz out there around pet food and the internet, but we're still continuing to see growth, not just in top line, but in units as well. And so that continues to do well for us. And so \u2013 and even in the lubricant category. So, without getting too specific, generally speaking, we continue to see growth, and we believe that's continuing to bring footsteps through the front doors. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And, I guess, a related question on the pet category. Is there a way to give us a sense of how Petsense is comping on its own versus pet comps within the Tractor stores? And then, just bigger picture on Petsense, now, a year in, any more color on what you're learning there, and how you're thinking about growth for the Petsense concept? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, we won't get too specific on comps, but I can tell you that it's running very much similar to how we're doing in Tractor Supply. So they're both running very positive. Second, as far as the overall growth and where this is headed, we've still got some integration things that we're doing, later this year, and the first part of next, and we're going to still say that there's many more hundreds of stores that we can open in Petsense, for Petsense in the rural environment. But we've got to get some other things in the works. We've got to get the website up. We've got to have some other structural things going on at Petsense to bring it kind of into the fold of how we operate at Tractor, and then I think you'll see us start to accelerate. So this year was a year of learning. What do we have? What does it look like? 2018 is the year of moving it forward, and I think beyond 2018 is the acceleration point. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good evening. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: How are you? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good evening, Steven. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So I wanted to focus on I guess in-store merchandising and maybe opportunities right as we think out here. So question for both Greg and Steve, if you can. So can you discuss the cadence of the 4Q seasonal resets by region, and the flexibility around the timing of the roll-out? And then as we think about as we head into 2018 and continuing kind of comp growth, where do you see the greatest opportunity within the box, right, as it relates to future category resets and new product introduction, right? What gets you excited about what you're putting forth to the consumer? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Steven, this is Steve. Let me go ahead and start. What I can tell you is is that we talked about the extended selling season for the spring/summer goods, and part of that, I think, we actually drove. And I say that because we've left more stores on year-round for a lot of the spring/summer goods in the Southern part of the U.S. Not only has it helped us operationally, but it's also gives us an opportunity to take advantage of a longer season. So that's some of the work we've done, and I think we're going to benefit from some of that not just in Q3, but maybe even a little bit in early Q4. In terms of the north, the set dates were very similar to what we did a year ago. I do think that every year our planning team, as they mature, continues to do a better job in assorting those stores from a timely standpoint, and also with the assortments that make the most sense for us. So I believe that we're really well positioned as we go into the back half of this year. Now in terms of what gets me excited about the inside of the box. I would tell you that there's a number of things. First off, in Q3, we had a strong performance within the four walls of the business. And while I know we talk a lot about the C.U.E. business and how that's performing, and we should, because it's doing well, there are other things outside of just C.U.E. that we're working on as well. In terms of things like big ticket, we've done some resets relative to log splitters and generators. We're even looking at our safe assortment, making modifications to that. On decor and spring goods \u2013 or, I'm sorry \u2013 fall and holiday goods, we're building off the momentum of what we had in spring, which was very strong for us. And I think we're going to have a really solid season in the back half of this year. As a matter of fact, the early signs right now are strong. And we're also launching a Trisha Yearwood decor collection, which we're kind of excited about, and we think it's going to really respond well with our customer base. We tested it in the spring. And then I would also lastly suggest to you that C.U.E. is still a focus for us. And we launched our version of 4health called UNTAMED, which is a high-protein diet, and it's already exceeded our original forecast. And I think our customers are responding favorably there. There's more opportunities within pet, we believe, as we continue to learn from Petsense and apply some of those learnings to our box as well and vice versa. And then in feed, I still believe that there's long-term growth for us as we continue to work our way into markets and consolidate what's taking place out there in that business. So across the board, and across the spectrum, I think there's opportunities, and I'm still pretty bullish on where they are. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you, Steve. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good evening. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You have a lot of visibility on some signals in your business. You have the pellet sales, you have layaway of pellets, and I think log splitters and so forth sales in the north. So last year, I remember you talked about the warm prior-year winter and the hot summer really didn't have \u2013 wasn't pulling the customer into the store for layaway of pellets and the early heating season was weak, as well. So, curious, what are you seeing in terms of those categories where you get an early read on how the heating business is setting up for the fourth quarter? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Chris, this is Steve. What I can tell you is \u2013 as Kurt mentioned earlier, that the early part of October started off a little warm and customers a lot of times buy on need. And when you come off of different seasons, there's usually early demand or not, based on what they remember from the prior year. We did have a cold December, but that was about it last year. And even when you worked in there, for the first part of this year, it was fairly mild compared to the year before. So our pellet \u2013 just to give you a sense for it \u2013 it picked up as it got colder, but, again, it's geographic. And a lot of our pellet business is done in the very Northeast. So, if you look at where it got cold, we saw demand for the cold-weather products. But as you moved further East to the Northeast, where it wasn't quite as cold yet, I still think that there's some pent-up demand that will come out once the colder weather hits. Log splitters, that's a little similar. We did do a reset, updated our log splitters, so we're seeing a little better performance than we saw a year ago. But that's what I can give you. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. And you called out specifically, I think, $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings headwinds from the margins and from the SG&A side next year. You came in \u2013 this quarter you came in and beat the Street by $0.04. So, is the right way to think about it that maybe the Street consensus is sort of $0.10 to $0.12 too high next year? Or do we sort of offset that with a $0.04 and be more of a $0.06 to $0.08 kind of reduction in the consensus is the right ZIP code as you think about it for 2018? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Chris, this is Kurt. I'd tell you, as I was preparing items to mention for 2018, I specifically brought up things that I believe may not be in the models or may not be factored in. Items that have changed in 2017 that we believe will carry into 2018, such as transportation costs, such as some of the labor headwinds, and gave you some color on the distribution center. So, I would tell you that bringing those up, it's because I anticipate those may not be factored into 2018's guidance. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But do we have to mitigate any of that by the fact that you just beat the Street nicely on a $0.04 beat. Do we offset it with that? Or do we just think about it from a gross $0.10 to $0.12 perspective? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, Chris, I think the one thing I'd tell you is that we don't give guidance on the quarter. And so the beat to the Street versus our internal expectations may be different. And I would tell you that the one thing in the quarter that was the primary item not expected was the $0.02 beat related to the hurricane. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot, and good afternoon. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good afternoon. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Can you quantify big ticket comps with and without the benefit from emergency relief products like generators? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Seth. I'd tell you that, as I mentioned, the big ticket sales were boosted by generator sales and other big ticket items from the hurricanes and were above chain average. When you exclude the impact of the hurricanes, big ticket had positive comps, but was slightly below the chain average. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research . Your line is open. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to poke a little bit about the company priorities. You talked a little bit about your investments in omni channel. And as we think forward, obviously you're going to build about 100 stores this year, as we think forward and you guys think about how you want to invest your capital, how do you think of stores versus e-commerce? And then I just had a quick follow-up on some of the conversations about 2018. Thanks. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Scott, this is Kurt. It's a good question and we look at both of those capital allocation investment items. New stores certainly are a key to Tractor Supply's overall growth strategy. They provide a good return on the investment. But today, what you're hearing and where we're focused on is not only growing the stores for continued top-line growth, but we're also focused on the things that we need to do and are part of our strategy for long-term growth. And so at this point, the 100 stores as part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue to evaluate that annually. And we do look at the e-commerce side of it. When I say e-commerce, I believe Steve and I would agree on this in that we refer to it more as the digital. Because it's an omni-channel investment. And so many of the sales can begin online. As Greg mentioned, the number of new or unique visitors to the website, how many are starting through a mobile device. So when we speak about e-commerce online investment, it's about the overall growth for Tractor Supply, both online and in the stores. So to get to the answer to your question, I would say that we're focused on challenging both store growth and the other digital investments, and we continue to analyze that. That could lead us to a number of store growth that is below 100 if we believe we need to manage both the capital and the SG&A burden of our investments. And we balance both of those out for the long term. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : So it is conceivable that as we get to 2018 and 2019 that we tack a little bit more towards omni-channel and digital in your thinking. And then with that thinking, this is my follow-up, could we start to maybe characterize 2018 as an investment year? Is that how you guys would maybe think about it as we go this direction? And then I'll yield. Thanks very much. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, it's a good question. I would say we've been on an increasing capital growth rate for omni-channel digital investment. We'll be near $65 million to $70 million investment this year. That number will grow next year. It may begin to stabilize on the investment specific to IT and digital at about $70 million or $80 million. But as a percentage, yeah, that's a bigger percentage. And it is a good analysis to say we'll evaluate both store capital investment along with the IT investment, and the IT investment may continue to bring a bigger percentage. And we have looked at 2017 and 2018 as investment years. So I would say it is a good way to describe 2018 continuing to have investment for the long term, and we're excited about the momentum we're seeing and some of those initiatives taking hold as part of the top-line sales growth. Operator : We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Your line is open. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. I have a short-term and a long-term question. First, the short-term question. Greg, on the benefit to sales from the hurricanes, will there be a continuing benefit as insurance checks and FEMA checks are distributed in the Houston and Florida area? And then the long-term question goes back to the idea about the investments in 2017 and 2018. And this is very different than the outlook presented at the Analyst Meeting back in February. I was just curious, at what point did the strategy change? Did you see these investment opportunities appear that would lead to operating margin rate dropping so much compared to the original plan of a 15 basis point to 25 basis point increase? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: I'll take the first part of the question, and maybe Kurt and I will double up on the second. We're going to see very little push in the business due to what happened around the Houston area. It's very isolated. It was flooding. You won't see a tremendous amount of benefit from our side, at least the Tractor \u2013 like maybe the home centers will see for rebuilding and reconstruction. Maybe some fencing replacement, but I don't think it's going to be major. There's actually more impact, Dan, when you look at what happened with Irma as she came through Florida. The power outages and things of that nature actually drove more of the business than did Harvey. To say that we have changed our thinking or changed the model of where we're going on long term, it would not be absolutely what's going on here. What we've been talking about is investment in bringing the digital and the physical places together. We've been doing this now for the last four years. We are seeing some pressures through some things in transportation. We're seeing that we're going to have to step up and move a little faster maybe in some of our omni-channel efforts. But this is nothing different than what we were talking about in the investor meetings. There is a little bit of movement. And one analyst mentioned earlier about do you think possibly that you may look at investing more on the digital side and a little less on the physical side as you balance this out over the next year or two. And I think that's probable, to be very honest. But we want to stay out in front of this, not be behind it. We believe now we've got the platforms in place. We've got some things to do in CRM and Neighbor's Club yet to really develop that and mature it. We've got some more things to do in mobile within our stores, putting some more technology in the stores. We've got a few things to do yet, just inside itself and how that both these component works. We've got a very, very strong and very healthy mix of business coming through the web, but translates at the store level. Very unusual when you think about it, versus much of the other retailers that you may throw us in the same basket with. So it's a little bit of some shifting around, Dan, but really no difference in strategy. We're still funding and pushing the same priorities that we talked about. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, and Dan, this is Kurt. The only thing I'll add to that is our long-term strategy or targets have not changed, and we're not saying that they have changed. At the Investment Community Day, we emphasized the long-term growth plan, particularly, as you mentioned, operating margin growth, 15, 20 basis point improvement. We said and knew that 2017 would not be in line with those long-term growth strategies, and we said the long-term growth is three to five years. And as 2017 has played out, additional pressures and costs on transportation, payroll investments, has perhaps changed a little bit of the level of performance that we foresee for 2018, but we still see realistic long-term targets for Tractor Supply to be able to drive the top line, as well as the operating margin growth rate in the long term. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Dan, the combination of everything is we're still looking to 3% to 5% is the comp rate from a long-term standpoint. And temporarily we may not be there, but we believe that is absolutely achievable. And operating margin of around 10% is the goal. I know we haven't been there in the last couple of years. We've had some investment that we've had to make, and some other changes within some structures, but we see in front of us over the next couple of years the opportunity to get back to those levels. Operator : We will take our next question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bradley B. Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes, thank you. And let me add my congratulations on the strong sales here as well. To follow up on a couple of the earlier questions, I guess just a clarification on CapEx. Any color about bringing that guidance down by about $20 million? And any additional color you could provide on new-store productivity, both in some of your denser markets as well as some of the newer markets out West? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Brad. This is Kurt. First, on CapEx, the guidance coming down is really two things. Most significant is going to be timing shift of the New York distribution center, and just the timing of key initial costs that go into it are shifting out of 2017 and into 2018. The only other real key change is more of a mix of the type of stores. So we either have a low-capital intensive prototype lease store or a retrofit with more capital, and the mix of stores in the back half Q3, Q4, has impacted the expectation on capital spending that has caused us to drop that $20 million. New store productivity, we're \u2013 as I mentioned on the call, we are pleased with new store productivity. The trends continue to show improvement over the 2016 year. And the results that we're seeing in the last couple of quarters, I think you'd see is pretty consistent to years like 2014 and 2015. The selection of stores and our ability to enter the markets quickly we've been pretty excited about. One thing on new-store productivity as you're calculating it, just as a reminder, with the integration of Petsense, with the smaller size, different model, the new store productivity, Petsense brings \u2013 has about a 600 basis point impact, bringing the number down. So if you exclude that out of your calculation, I think you'll be more in line with what we look at as the comparable Tractor Supply new store productivity. Operator : We will take our next question come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good evening, everyone. Great quarter. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : When you're looking at the third quarter, what kind of merchandising programs apart from the normal seasonal stuff worked? I noticed you had Chick Days reemerge in a number of stores, and how are you looking at that for the fourth quarter, especially if you want to get past what might be a warm start or maybe another warm winter? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Steve. We did, I would say, maximize the opportunity in our center court space. We did have a fall Chick Days, as you mentioned, and we thought that that went very successfully. We heard a lot from our stores and our customers how much they enjoyed that. And we saw some sales from it. At the same time, there were a couple of other events that we did, no different than what we've done in the past, but I think we had a lot more newness, and we really hit, I think, a better sweet spot with our customer with the product selection. So the center courts certainly helped us. In addition to that, some of the resets that I mentioned earlier, I think, paid off for us both in pet food and in feed, and a couple other categories as well. And we had a little bit of a carry through in some of our live goods as well, Chuck. As you look to desensitize your business in Q4, which is always a challenge, because we want to grow that seasonal business, because our customers need it when the weather does hit, some of the offsets to that are in our core basics. And I think that's one of the reasons we put so much effort into some of the resets into some of the non-seasonal businesses, such as the consumables. And so with the launch of several product lines in pet as well as in feed, we think that that will continue to drive traffic should the weather not necessarily come. In the center court, I mentioned earlier that we are really going to feed off the momentum of the decor selection and a lot of the holiday sets. And the early read on that is very positive, along with the new collection that we'll be launching from Trisha Yearwood. So I think that there's a lot of things outside of weather that we've done. Now, will they offset that completely if it stays warm the entire back half? I can't necessarily say that, but I can tell you I think we've put our best foot forward. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Operator : We will take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good evening. I wanted to ask \u2013 the 1.5% increase in the comp transaction value is notable. It's a nice uplift and certainly an uptick relative to what you've seen in the last five quarters or so. Kurt, of the 120 basis point benefit to comps that you called out from the hurricane, how much of that benefited ticket versus transaction count? And then if you could also eliminate the margin impact, the gross margin impact from the hurricane, that'd be helpful. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Ben, this is Kurt. On the ticket side, I'd say we said about 1.5% comp ticket increase for the third quarter, and roughly about a third of that was related to the big ticket and the hurricanes. The rest of it was principally more broad, just overall product mix. So from the ticket side, I'd say that's really about 50 basis points, and you can basically deduct that as part of the 120 basis point overall. And then on the gross margin side, when it comes to rate, we basically saw that the hurricanes drove top line, did not really have a significant impact on the rate. We had generators at a lower average rate price, but you had other higher-ticket items on the truck tool or hardware side. And then you did have some higher transportation costs to get the product to the consumer, and get it there quickly. There certainly were some higher transportation costs. You probably also read and heard that generally, starting in about late August, September, the demand for transportation through those hurricanes put a significant demand on the transportation system, and costs went up. So we look at it on the gross margin side as about a net neutral on rate. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: That's great clarity, thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thanks, guys. Good quarter. You had been talking a bit, in the prepared remarks, about labor investment. Sounds like there's two dynamics with your adding hours, but there's also some wage pressure. Could you give a little more detail on those? I guess the \u2013 maybe first off is the labor investment beginning to drive any sales benefit that you can see? And then the wage pressure sounds like a new comment. I don't recall hearing that. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint, how long that pressure might last? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, sure, Peter. Good questions. First, I'd tell you that, as Greg mentioned, with additional hours, where it's meeting the customer's needs, and as our customer comes into the store, and is looking for that expert advice and service, as well as the customer solution center, we've invested additional payroll hours. We believe that's all part of the top-line growth. Our stores speak and talk often, as you've heard us talk about G.U.R.A. And we want to make sure that our G.U.R.A. and our customer service is at the top level currently today in the retail environment. So, that is having an impact. We believe it's all part of our initiative and what's driving the top line. When it comes to the wage pressure, I would just say that what we've seen in pockets, certain states, as you're aware, have instituted some regulations that have had an impact to us. And then in pockets both in the stores and distribution center side, where there's some competitive wage pressures, it is important for us to maintain \u2013 hire and maintain the best team members, and we've certainly made sure that that is top priority. And that is putting some level \u2013 moderate level of impact in the third and fourth quarter, and we believe we'll see some of that in 2018. Not saying that this is a level of significant it could have a 10 or 20 basis point impact in 2018 on the wage side. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks that's helpful. Good luck on the fourth quarter, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, good evening, guys. This is actually Justin Kleber on for Pete. Thanks for taking the question. If I look at the comp acceleration rolled into 2Q and adjust out for the hurricanes life, I'm still trying to understand if the improvement that you've seen was primarily driven by seasonal and big ticket or did you actually see sales within that core livestock and pet category also accelerate relative to what you experienced in the first half? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes, this is Steve, and what I would tell you is, is that it was fairly broad-based, as Greg mentioned in his comments. While the pet and animal side probably was consistent with what we've traditionally seen. The other three walls of the box performed at pretty good levels. So, the traffic that was brought through, it seemed to translate within all four corners, and within most of the product mix. That's how I'd respond to that. Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then - Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Go ahead. Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: No, I'm sorry, Greg, go ahead. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, I was going to just follow up to say that our business was very strong well before the hurricanes ever came in. So, we were enjoying a very strong third quarter of sales. The hurricanes added a little at the end, but you lose at the beginning, you kind of lose in the middle, and you maybe pick up a little along the way with \u2013 the hurricane effects are not something that you plan on year to year, but that did not drive the third quarter results. We had a very strong business well before the hurricanes ever came. Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Yeah, it sounds like maybe the pet and livestock business also improved as well. And just my second question for either you, Greg, or Steve, just was hoping you could maybe discuss any broader thoughts or observations as it relates to pet food category. As to these channel exclusive brands we're seeing move into the FDN (01:03:55) channel. Do you see any cannibalization to your business, as those brands become more broadly distributed? And maybe how does that influence just your thinking on private label with the core health brand? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Great question. I mean, that seems to be a big topic, certainly in the pet circles right now, with everything that is taking place out there. I will tell you that for the last, I don't know, five, six, seven years, we've worked really hard to develop our own exclusive brands, and also get behind those brands that have a little bit more channel exclusivity to them. And while there may be a few folks go into mass and doing some things online, the strength of our business continues to be very strong in those brands that we identify with, that our customers identify with, that are much more channel specific. Our private brands, if I were to give you a sense for the quarter, and even for the year, are outstripping on a comp basis what the national brands are doing within our box. Our team members have gotten behind those. We've added several subcategories of those in 4health as well. We'll continue to do an extension of our assortment within the retriever line. And then, as I mentioned earlier, the UNTAMED launch, which is more of an LID-type (01:05:22) product, I think, is going to do incredibly well. And the early read on that is very strong. So, when we look long term at that business, we still see upside. We're staying very close to what's happening in the marketplace, but we have accelerated our own efforts to continue to move faster into the exclusive brand side. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group : Hi, guys. Good afternoon, or good evening, I should say. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick things. One was when you guys look at the e-commerce sales that you're having, are you seeing it \u2013 like more penetration from existing customers? Are you actually seeing new customers come into the fold, or like is it \u2013 newer ZIP codes that you hadn't seen before? Anything you can share on that? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Joe, this is Steve. I would tell you that it's a broad base of our customers that are coming to us. Whether it be Buy Online Pick Up in Store, I can give you examples of new customers who have found us through the web. At the same time, as Greg mentioned earlier, the majority of our customers are coming into our stores to pick up the product. Store locator is one of the key metrics for us, and we're finding that the store locator is up significantly in terms of percentage year-over-year, where customers are going online and then trying to find out where their nearest Tractor Supply Company store is. And then relative to customers that would like to have products shipped to them, again, that's only about 25% of our total sales. And what we're finding is is that it's a broad range of categories and most of those products are within the ZIP Codes that we have stores. And I think it's more of a convenience for them. Operator : Our next question comes Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good evening, guys. And thanks for squeezing us in. This Rob Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. So I wanted to follow up on some of the expense issues that you talked about earlier. So, you outlined expense pressures for the DC next year and higher incentive compensation costs potentially, but you also did talk about higher wages and freight and transportation costs. Can you help us get a better sense for the magnitude of those incremental cost pressures? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Rob. This is Kurt. The best I can tell you at this point is we're going through our budgeting timeframe right now. The items that I mentioned, such as the new distribution center investment and the additional depreciation related to the investments, those are the more significant items. And so I would tell you they're listed in order of magnitude being depreciation and a new distribution center, to a lesser extent payroll and wage pressures is probably the best I can tell you at this point. Still a lot to be calculated and forecasted for 2018. Incentive comp, as I mentioned, I gave you the magnitude of that. It all depends on performance in 2018 and could have a magnitude of $0.06 to $0.08 next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi, good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in as well. Nice quarter. So, I apologize because I was on and off the call. But I just want to understand better, you did a 6.6% comp in Q3. That's a very nice number. If I'm hearing you correctly the hurricanes were not a big driver of that. So it was more reflective of the actual underlying business. And then if you look at the guidance, what's implied in the fourth quarter does assume a deceleration in comps. Is that a function of what we've seen so far, is the weather and extrapolating that, more difficult comparisons basically? So how should we think about the comps going from Q3 to Q4? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Brian, this is Greg. That's us being our typical \u2013 let's say we're being conservative and knowing that what we've put out there we believe we can achieve. Given a little bit of weather favorability, those numbers could change. But we were being more conservative. We did with the guidance change indicate between 1% and 2%, so it's not a low or high range. It's just somewhat of a conservative average is what we're targeting for the fourth quarter. We've got an immense December we're up against. And we took that into consideration with that forecast. Operator : We will take our next question from John Lawrence with Coker & Palmer. Your line is open. John R. Lawrence - Coker & Palmer, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Afternoon, John. John R. Lawrence - Coker & Palmer, Inc.: Yeah, would you just comment a little bit, Steve, we've always talked about this new product development cycle. Is there anything different that you're getting some of this product to market sooner, the process is faster, you've got better data on a regional basis, and I assume the success of that product just continues to sell through at a better rate than it was two years or three years ago? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: John, I love it when you ask the question because those are the kind of questions I'm prepared for. So thank you for the predictability. What I can tell you is new products are critically important to our engine, certainly our sales engine. And we talk about filling often, early and cheaply, and I would tell you that the merchant team's gone out and there's a lot of tests that we're conducting right now. There is a lot of newness in the store and I think a lot of that has to do with a couple things. One, there's maturity in our sourcing side of our business. We're starting to finally get our legs under us after a few years of new folks coming in, learning the processes, learning the culture, learning our partnerships that we have overseas and domestically. In terms of the planning department, they've done a nice job as they've continued to mature in identifying local opportunities and assortment planning opportunities for the merchants and bringing them back. And I think that we're better assorted today than we have been in the past. And we've also gone out and we've hired a number of new merchants on the buying team that have brought with us a wealth of experience from retailers that do things differently and maybe have an expertise in certain areas. So across the board, I feel pretty good about the movement and the traction that we're getting there. I don't want to say that that's the season for Q3's strength of business. I think it was much more broad-based than that for a variety of things. But I am encouraged as we move forward into Q4 and into 2018 that we've got a good grounding for where we're going to be headed. Operator : And we will take our final question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. I'll try to make this quick. I just had, really, two parts both related to margin. I think the first one, as I think about the 4Q gross margin decline, could you just walk us through like the biggest components of that? I think you mentioned freight being one of them, but I'm sort of curious, because as it looks like the compare is a bit easier, but if you'd just remind us what you're up against. And secondly, you reiterated a 10% op margin target longer term in the context of IT maybe being a bit of a drag, online and C.U.E. maybe being a bit of a drag. Just trying to look and understand really the offsets there. When you think out a few years, how do you get back there? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Yeah, Stephen, in regards to Q4, we continue to see benefit and expect and anticipate from our gross margin initiatives pricing, strategic sourcing. We see some opportunity at the product margin rate in gross margin. Our anticipation is that would be offset by the headwinds we've seen on the transportation side, so it's really simply when it comes to compare, we think we can drive some improvement in the direct product margin, but that is going to be offset by higher costs on the transportation side. And then in regards to the long-term operating margin, I guess the best we could say is that we anticipate next year for the few items we mentioned and the investments in our long-term initiatives to have an increase in SG&A for those items. But most of those are either one time or they're temporary investments. And what I would tell you is that we see from there we're able to build as we are able to impact the top line and be able to maintain and improve the level of expense leverage from there. So looking out beyond 2018, it's too difficult to get specific, but there's a lot of what you see in the 2018 investments similar to 2017 that are very specific to the current or temporary investments in the business. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And that is all the time that we have for questions. I will now turn the call over to Greg Sandfort for additional or closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: All right. Before I wrap up the call, I'd like to inform all of you that Christine Skold, this is her last earnings call. She's decided to leave Tractor Supply Company after a lot of thought and reflection. She shared this decision with her internal team a few weeks ago, and she felt it was time for her to find a new opportunity to further her professional growth. She will be actively engaged in the IR function through next Friday November 3. I'd like to thank Christine for her 15 years of dedicated service here at Tractor Supply.

Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start today's call by providing a review of the operational and financial highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017, then review our strategic priorities going forward. Kurt will provide additional detail regarding our financial results and review our guidance for fiscal 2018. Following that, we will open the call for questions. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the continued progress of our ONETractor strategic initiatives to drive long-term sales growth, a more personalized customer experience, increased market share in all channels, and improved profitability over time. Our fourth quarter comparable store sales increased 4%, was driven by broad-based strength across all of our geographic regions and merchandise categories as well as increases in both comparable store transactions and average ticket. We know our customers look to Tractor Supply for their everyday basic needs and living their lifestyle. We believe the continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and updates to our in-store and online shopping experience are resonating with our customers. I want to thank our Tractor Supply team members across the country for a strong quarter and a solid year. Throughout the year, the team reacted to changing market conditions to optimize our performance, while we continued to invest in key initiatives that will drive longer term growth. The balance between daily execution and investing for the future is critical to the long-term success of any retailer, and our team did an excellent job of this in 2017. Now, let me touch on a few financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable store sales increased a strong 4% in the quarter and 2.7% for the year, with both transaction count on average ticket increasing in the quarter and full year. Net sales reached a record $7.26 billion for the year as we continued our strategy to open new stores to gain market share. The fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.87, and adjusted EPS was $0.91. For the full year, diluted EPS was $3.30, with adjusted EPS of $3.33. We generated cash from the operations of $631 million, while returning $503 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends for the year. And this was the seventh consecutive year that we increased our quarterly cash dividend for shareholders. Now, in terms of operational highlights for 2017. We opened 101 new Tractor Supply stores and 25 Petsense locations, increasing our selling square footage by approximately 6%. We broke ground on a new distribution center in Frankfort, New York to support our expansion in the Northeast corridor of the country. We saw solid progress with many of our ONETractor initiatives. We rolled out Neighbor's Club, our loyalty program, across all channels. We significantly expanded our Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities, we began testing our Stockyard and mobile PoS technologies, and we invested in store labor hours to ensure we would deliver on our commitment to legendary customer service. The end result was improved sales trends throughout the year and the highest customer satisfaction scores we have seen in the past 10 years. There's no question these two metrics are correlated and everything we do at Tractor Supply is with our customer in mind. We know there is a large customer base who need our products every day. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to serve this customer base better than anyone in the market and we see significant opportunities to broaden our customer base and increase our market share as our store base and online presence expands. Looking forward, ONETractor, which we began talking about at our Investment Community Day last year, is our ongoing strategy to leverage our unique positioning with our customers and to drive sustainable growth. We are accomplishing -- what we're accomplishing is more than just growing our e-commerce business. We are providing a convenient seamless shopping experience for our customers. ONETractor is a broad-based strategy to align the entire organization on how to better serve our customers while improving our supply chain to maximize both our near term and long-term results. This strategy is grounded in our foundational strengths of operational efficiency and a culture of team member engagement that ranks among the top in retail. Our ONETractor strategy initiatives are clearly aligned around four key objectives : driving profitable growth; building customer-centric engagement; offering the most relevant products and services; and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. As always, we will continue to take a balanced approach for managing the business and keeping the long-term focus in mind. Given the progress we have made and the positive results we are experiencing for many of our ONETractor initiatives, we are excited about our future investment opportunities. In 2018, our capital spending is prioritized to new stores, with an increase of capital dedicated to our store-level initiatives and our supply chain. We believe this is the right focus for the business this coming year. In 2018, we plan to open approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. Our pipeline for 2018 for new store openings is robust and we are in the process of working on site selection for 2019 and 2020. And our recent data continues to support the potential for upwards of 25,000 Tractor Supply locations over time, and we will continue to be pleased -- and we are continued to be pleased with the new store productivity and their returns. Now, for 2018, we anticipate to open approximately 20 new Petsense stores, and we continue to believe that the Petsense format provides us with a unique opportunity to grow our Pet business by targeting a different customer with a differentiated preference for products and services not available today in a Tractor Supply store. 2017 was a year of progress and learnings with Petsense and 2018 will be a year of system and process integration as we apply best practices from Tractor Supply to Petsense. In 2018, we anticipate the initial roll out phase of our new point-of-sale system across the Tractor Supply chain that will integrate with our mobile PoS. The new PoS will allow us to improve the customer experience at checkout, integrate our e-commerce order management system and leverage customer data to ensure a seamless shopping experience across all channels. We will continue to roll out Stockyard, which allows our team members and customers to leverage our digital assets and extend online assortments while they're in the store. This is particularly helpful when a customer is looking for a unique or hard to find item that may be make or model-specific. And also in 2018, we will be enhancing our online capabilities, including testing subscription services for recurring purchases of key products. Our Neighbor's Club loyalty program is a great example of how we are moving fast to better serve our customers while targeting personalized communication to them. Since our national roll out in April of 2017, we have quadrupled our enrollment to about 7 million members now. With Neighbor's Club, we now have a 360-degree view of our customers' buying behaviors. This is a tremendous tool that should allow us to offer more relevant services and products to our customers as we leverage the data we have collected. And in regards to our supply chain, our largest initiatives in 2018 are the completion of our New York distribution facility, the addition of two additional mixing centers, and an East Coast import center that will help the flow of our direct imports. In total, we plan to invest approximately $80 million in these projects, with the majority of the spend falling in 2018. While this will increase our capital spending budget this year, the build out of our distribution network will improve our delivery to stores and enhance our speed of delivery for direct to customer purchases. Our team made great progress in 2017 and we are building a solid foundation for future growth. We will continue to invest in the business across our ONETractor strategy, while moving fast but deliberately to capture efficiencies that will in turn drive profitable growth. I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review our financial results for the quarter and the year. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Greg and good afternoon everyone. While Greg has taken you through the highlights of 2017, let me provide you with some additional financial details and review our initial outlook for 2018. As a reminder, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, Petsense sales are now included in our comparable store sales performance. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we had strong comp store sales growth of 4%, with comp transaction count increasing 2.7% versus an increase of 4% in last year's fourth quarter. Comps were positive across all geographic regions and all major product categories. All months had positive comp sales performance, with November being the strongest month of the quarter. Sales were positively impacted as cold temperatures arrived across our markets and our customers responded favorably to our assortment. Petsense comp store sales were essentially in line with the chain average. Comp sales average ticket increased 1.3% compared to prior year's reported 90 basis point decrease. The increase was primarily driven by the mix of goods. For the first time in 17 quarters, deflation was essentially neutral and was not a meaningful drag on comps. For the fourth quarter, gross margin increased 50 basis points to 34.2%. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to less promotional activity and improved sell-through rates on seasonal products during the quarter. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in transportation cost, driven by higher carrier rates, and diesel fuel cost, coupled with a higher mix of freight-intensive products. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 120 basis points to 24.8% from 23.6% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to deleverage of occupancy and other fixed cost resulting from the 53rd week of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 that did not reoccur this year, and higher store payroll from our continued commitment to customer service. Also impacting SG&A in the fourth quarter were higher store level incentive compensation, resulting from the strong comparable store sales increase and incremental investments in infrastructure and technology related to our ONETractor initiatives. Our effective tax rate was 38.9% in the fourth quarter, which was higher due to a one-time non-cash write-down of our net deferred tax assets of approximately $4.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share as a result of our lower effective tax rate going forward. Our balance sheet is strong and our working capital is in good shape. For the fourth quarter, our comp store inventory at Tractor Supply stores was essentially flat year-over-year. Exiting the year, we believe our inventory is well-positioned, given the sales strength we had in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2017, we generated cash from operations of $631 million. Total capital expenditures were $250 million with approximately 40% of this being maintenance-related and the remaining 60% being growth-oriented in areas such as new stores, digital capability investments, and supply chain infrastructure capability. For the quarter, we repurchased about 694,000 shares of our common stock for $42.8 million. We repurchased over $369 million or about 5.9 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2017. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $870 million as of year-end. Turning now to guidance for 2018. We expect net sales to range -- in a range of $7.69 billion to $7.77 billion, an increase of 6% to 7%. Comp store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 2% to 3%. As Greg mentioned earlier, we anticipate opening about 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 20 new Petsense locations. Our plans call for approximately half of our new stores to open in the first half of the year. Turning now to cost. As has been well publicized, the retail industry is facing cost pressures on rising freight rates due to a shortage of drivers and higher diesel fuel prices along with inflationary wage pressures across retail locations and the supply chain. As I shared with you last quarter, we are not immune to these increases. The team is working to balance our initiatives and the investments we are making in our stores and at the distribution centers with strict cost disciplines and underlying operational efficiencies. All-in, between our investments to grow the business and the external headwinds, we anticipate some pressure in 2018 on our operating margin. The largest items include : first, anticipated higher freight cost driven by rising transportation rates and the higher diesel fuel cost; wage investments for our team members at our stores and distribution centers; as well, preopening expenses and incremental operating expenses for the ramp-up of our new distribution center in Upstate New York. We are forecasting the distribution center cost to impact the second half of 2018, predominantly in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that gross margin would be flat to down slightly with the bulk of the pressure on SG&A. Given the combination of investments we are making in the business and cost headwinds, operating margin, at the midpoint of our guidance range, is assumed to be about 8.8%. Our outlook includes about 20 basis points of incremental investments to accelerate our priorities as we balance the allocation of benefits from tax reform. More than ever, we are aggressively reviewing our cost structure as we look to strengthen our competitive advantages to better serve our customers. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities, all on a sustainable basis. Net income is forecasted in the range of $490 million to $515 million or $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share. We would anticipate stronger comp store sales and earnings performance in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. Given the comparisons for 2017, our comp sales in the first half of the year are forecasted to be at or above our guidance range for the year, with the second half of the year below the range. For the first quarter of 2018, we will have one extra comp day as we were open on New Year's Day for the first time. We estimate this extra day will contribute about 60 to 70 basis points to comparable store sales in the first quarter and about 10 to 15 basis points for the full year. We would also anticipate that the first quarter of 2018 will have the highest comp and the lowest level of operating profit margin compression of the year. Moving to below the line. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be positively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017. The Tax Act is expected to reduce our effective tax rate from approximately 36.7% to a range of 23% to 23.5% in 2018. As I mentioned, a portion of the benefits will be allocated to accelerating investments in labor wages at our stores and in our distribution centers, and the support of our ONETractor initiatives. We're also modestly increasing our capital spending to a range of $260 million to $300 million with about 75% of the spending going towards initiatives to support long-term growth. Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $17 million to $20 million. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase 9% to 10%. For the year, our share repurchases are anticipated to be towards the high end of our target to reduce our weighted average shares outstanding by 2.5% to 3.5%. For modeling purposes, we have assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 124 million shares in 2018. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We also are committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and consistent share repurchases. That concludes my prepared remarks and I will now turn the call back to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Kurt. As we mark our 80th anniversary as a company, we are proud of our history and strong heritage of embracing change and leveraging technology to capture growth opportunities. I want to thank the more than 26,000 members of the Tractor Supply family who bring our mission and values to life everyday as they serve our customers. Our passion and commitment to provide legendary service and great products at everyday low prices will continue to be the foundation of our growth. With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. Now, we will take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good afternoon. Maybe if you could start, I think I heard you right, but can you provide some additional context around the implied margin guidance for next year at the midpoint, right? As we digested last quarter, right, the margin headwinds you laid out, I believe you mentioned 20 basis points of incremental pressure as you balance the benefit of tax reform. Is that, right? And then can you just help us understand where those dollars are being spent as you try to accelerate some of the opportunities you see? Kurt Barton : Sure Steve and this is Kurt. I'll first just confirm what you said. Yes, we indicated that about 20 basis points is investment from tax reform that's impacting the operating margin. But if I step back to the Q3 call, we indicated as to what we saw in regards to our investments and cost pressures, we anticipated operating margin decline in 2018. If you try to bridge that to the guidance that we have, we've -- we'd have about 50% of that operating margin implied deleveraged in 2018 specific to investments in the business. And I would tell you that with investments from the business that we have related to tax reform, as we see that opportunity to invest those resources into labor wages at the stores and distribution centers, as well as ONETractor initiatives, the additional implied into our guidance has more visibility to areas like transportation cost that I would say that even in the last few months, it's been widely publicized, indicated about the transportation industry that we're seeing greater headwinds into that area. So, the difference in our outlook today as to what was indicated at Q3, principally due to the investments that we're making in the business and stronger cost pressures specific to the transportation industry. Steven Forbes : Thank you for that. And then maybe just a quick follow up on supply chain, right. So maybe just a higher level, help us conceptualize how you view the capabilities in the network post New York. You mentioned a few other additions that are hitting this year. But do you envision having to add direct fulfillment points to the network or additional capabilities? I mean, where do you see the evolution of the network kind of going over the next couple of years here? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Steve, this is Steve Barbarick. I would tell you, at this point, once we get that New York distribution center up, we've already got an expansion going on at Waverly, so I feel really good about that. We do have some mixing centers that we believe can continue to add value as we're bringing speed in both products to there. We're using 3PL in trying to get a better sense for that. But all of this will be baked into our CapEx guidance as we move forward. So as we move forward, you'll see that in the numbers. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. First question, just around -- you mentioned kind of store-level initiatives. I may have heard talk about the PoS, maybe talk a little bit more about what that -- the cost pressures, I guess, around rolling out the PoS? And then, are there other store initiatives? I'm thinking lay out changes, things like that, merchandising, that you're testing, Steve, that you think could have an impact, if not this year, maybe in 2019? Kurt Barton : Yes. And Peter, this is Kurt. I'll start with the first question on your question related to point-of-sale. And we're indicating that -- we're making investments in our point-of-sale system. That will be capital that we're investing this year. So, it has some impact in depreciation in 2017. It's not a significant part of that depreciation as we roll that capital out throughout the year, but that's where most of the cost. No other real operating cost impacts specific to a new investment of point-of-sale. Steve Barbarick : And Peter I would -- I think the question -- the way I'll respond is less about the expense side, more about the sales and opportunity side. So, we have really laid out reset program that we're working toward for the spring and into the summer of this next year that I'm very excited about. You'll see a lot of newness within the center courts and up and down the aisles. The only other one that I would mention, and I think we've hinted to this in the past is that we do have a couple of concept stores that we're working on right now. They're up and running. The layouts are a little bit different. They're still within the same size box, similar prototype. So, if we find that they're working well, then what we'll be able to do is retrofit them back into the existing stores should we opt to. It also gives us an opportunity to put this new format into existing stores as we move forward. Essentially, that layout is -- we reduced the number of SKUs that we felt we could accommodate through our fulfillment channels in e-commerce. And then giving more space to categories that we believe we have an opportunity to continue to grow share in, so the bigger bulkier products within the inside of the store. We've got a number of pallet drops that we've opened up for our operations team to better manage the labor model. And I would say, the early read on those two stores has been very positive from both the field as well as from our customers. So, I would anticipate, in the future, you'll see more of that concept in a lot of the new stores. And then we'll be looking at retrofitting some existing stores to see what the customer's feedback is on that. Peter Benedict : That's fair. That's helpful. I guess my follow-up, looking in terms of the online business, I may have missed it, but did you guys give the percentage of sales that were online for the year? And then as you look out over 2018 and 2019, maybe talk about how you view your pricing online, what type of tools you may have to help optimize that as we go forward? Thank you. Steve Barbarick : Sure. So, in Q4, that's usually a heavier time of the year for us on the e-com side and our percent of sales was probably between 2.5% and 3%. That's what it was. For the full year, it was between 1.5% and 2%. So, as we look forward, we continue to see that as a growth mechanism for us. And it's in two ways. It's Buy Online Pickup in Store as well as some of the ship to home product. The vast majority of what we do today is picked up in store, so whether it be shipped to store or picked up in store, our customers still like to come and engage with us in the four walls, but a few would like the convenience of having it shipped to them. As you look forward, we've done a really nice job, the team has, going out and doing price surveys, looking at where a lot of the major brands are positioned. And I feel that we're very competitive today. And as we move forward with ONETractor, one of the capabilities we're adding is a more robust price intelligence tool. And we believe that will give us greater value in the future as well. So, a number of things that play here, but all very positive as we move forward with our ONETractor strategy. Peter Benedict : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of follow-up questions here. I guess, just first on the investments and the margin outlook. I'm just wondering, have you guys built in any positive offsets within the guidance? And then, in general, if you think about the potential for sales to maybe come in better, would that flow through or would you offset that with more spending, just given the demands and the higher investment requirements that you're basically talking about? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, this is Kurt. You know what, when we built our outlook for 2018, we took a pretty rigorous look at all of the cost and all the spend. And I would tell you that in an investment like this, we certainly have an opportunity and there are some benefits that we've got that are offsets to these investments that are baked into that outlook. As we're growing the topline and with comp positives in there, there are areas in the overhead store support center cost, the store and distribution center occupancy cost, some of the investments we've made in there as well as leverage, we're seeing the benefits. So, we take it -- we're taking a pretty rigorous look at and we are managing tightly, and there are definitely some benefits that play into the outlook to help offset some of those investments. And then the second question-- Seth Sigman : Okay. The second part of that was just to the extent that sales do come in better, I realize some of the investments are within your control, some are not. But would better sales flow through? Or do you think that you would accelerate spending further just given the investment requirements in the business? Kurt Barton : Yes. Seth, I would say that we've got a pretty good aggressive investment plan, I think, as you've seen. And so as those investments start to take hold, and as we believe they will begin to drive the sales, our plan, our strategy is we'll invest to what our capacity and capability is. And I think we've got a realistic capacity in there. And so you'd see some benefits dropping to the bottom line. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Gregory Sandfort : Hey Liz. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hey. On your planned store opening pace, slowing a little bit from about 6.6% in 2017 to about 5% in 2018. First question is, are there still a few stores left to close? And then second is why slow the pace of store growth if you're going to have some extra cash post tax reform? I mean, obviously, you're making some investments in ONETractor that are going to be pretty significant. But is there also maybe a strain on management resources in terms of finding the right people to run new stores? Gregory Sandfort : Liz hi, this is Greg. No, there's no limit on how many stores actually we could open from the standpoint of management in the ranks ready. The reason we slowed to 80, if you want to call it that, I say there's a redirection of our capital investments. We've had some tremendous success with some of these ONETractor initiatives. It's a bit of a reallocation of capital in the short term to accelerate those and continue to keep the store opening schedule robust. We don't have any one that's chasing us for these sites. And we're going through with some new data that's demonstrating again to us that there are at least 25,000, as a number, of Tractor sites out there. Now we know that Tractor stores are a great value to the consumer, and they also help us from a standpoint of profitability as a company. But we really are just reallocating some of those dollars to accelerate some of the things in ONETractor that right now are showing us great promise. Elizabeth Suzuki : All right, great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening guys. Gregory Sandfort : Good evening. Christopher Horvers : So my first question is can you talk about the performance of the oil and gas markets? They were a drag as oil prices dropped, and then they're a bit more and more neutral, I think, over the past couple of quarters. How has the performance of those stores changed in the fourth quarter relative to, say, the second and the third? Kurt Barton : Yes, Chris, this is Kurt. I would tell you that as we've seen it and said that the Texas, Oklahoma oil market and other energy areas have those headwinds have subsided. And the last couple of quarters, prior to Q4, they -- we said that we saw those areas falling in within chain average. And I would tell you, we're pleased in the fourth quarter in those particular areas to see some good strong performance in their -- in line with chain average. And so as you're seeing indicators of that area, I would say that we're pleased to see that no longer really being a headwind for us. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then also there's a bit of an earlier Easter this year, I think it's April 1st, so it flows right, I guess, at the start of your second quarter. Historically, has an earlier Eastern helps you? And is it sort of -- is it 50 basis points, is it 25, is it 75? Any quantification will be very helpful. Thanks very much. Kurt Barton : Sure, it's a good question. I would say that it's not about an early Easter helping or hurting. I think it's a good point to bring up in that the timing of Easter between the halves where it plays into. So, this year, we've got Easter on the Sunday right after the end of Q1. So, the holiday weekend, that Friday and Saturday will be in Q1 and so that can shift a little bit between Q1 and Q2. When weather breaks in March has probably more to do about the impact than that weekend. But I would say that as you look at that, we anticipate that, that weekend falling into Q1 can have some impact, but not a material. Christopher Horvers : Okay. Thanks very much. Have a great quarter. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on the outlook for comp over the next few quarters. So, it sounds like inflation has become some of an issue, the oil and gas markets have stabilized. You're providing an optimistic outlook for the next couple of quarters where you said that you expect your comps to be above 3% or near that range, and yet your -- in the second half of the year and middle of the year, comparisons become harder. But you're also talking about sub 2% comp when all of these factors should going to be a benefit and you'll experience a return on the investments that you've been making. So, why would you only be expecting less than a 2% comp in that sort of scenario? Kurt Barton : Sure Michael, this is Kurt. In regards to our outlook, as we looked at the year and I'd say the most significant factor in there is the strength of the second half of 2017 and the comparisons over there. We had in Q3 two strong hurricanes that will be cycling as well as a good strong performance in fourth quarter with weather and other positive factors. So, we've got that compare to go up against. When we look at the year, we're taking a good realistic approach as to what we can actually drive in regards to traffic and sales and aren't making too many wide assumptions about what might happen in the second half there. We're going to drive our strategies that we believe will benefit both the first half and the second half. And our guidance is more about our ability to have good significant -- good consistent traffic, and it's more about the comparison in the second half of the year. Michael Lasser : And my follow question is on the performance of the new stores in the fourth quarter, if we back out the contributions from the extra week, it looks like the new store productivity was in the high 50% range. Is that right? And is that what you expect new store productivity to be moving forward? Kurt Barton : I would -- Mike, I would just say that, that percentages would not be consistent with new store productivity as it's calculated. And I understand the 53rd week makes this fourth quarter probably the hardest one to calculate for new store productivity. Here's what I'll tell you, is that we continue to be pleased with new store productivity. Fourth quarter had a good strong new store productivity and the -- consistent with the last few quarters in 2017, our new store productivity is consistent with 2015 in those years where we saw strength in new store productivity. We're pleased -- we look at our new stores and compare against -- measure against performance to the pro forma and the IR hurdle, and the 2017's have outperformed both of those. So, we're pleased with new store productivity. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Good luck with the year. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated. Benjamin Bienvenu : Good evening. And thanks for taking my questions. Gregory Sandfort : Hey Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu : I wanted to ask about operating margins in a little bit different way. So, you said you expected the midpoint operating margins for this next year to be 8.8%. Is it your expectation that this is for the low watermark in the multiyear trajectory for operating margins longer term and you still think a 10% operating margin goal long-term is a realistic goal? Kurt Barton : Yes, Ben, this is Kurt. And so I would tell you that if I -- I'd step back, talk a little bit about the business and what we see long-term, I would say the business is strong, the investments are clearly paying off for a lot of the things that Greg mentioned earlier. The investments are having some pressure and had in 2017 and are having pressure as we anticipate in 2018. But we're committed to those investments being made to drive long-term topline, and then the overall bottom-line, we believe that we're going to grow with those investments, EPS at a low double-digit range. And as we manage those investments and our cost, we can grow operating margin. And so as you look at 2018, we will be focused heavily on the cost and management of investments. But we believe we have the opportunity in the long term to continue to grow operating margin. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, I wanted to shift as it relates to some of your investments and distribution network changes. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the impacts from the West Coast 3PL trans load center and what you think it could mean for your business as you put in place your East Coast import center in 2018? Steve Barbarick : Yes, this is Steve. What it's really helped us do is bring product in, house it and ship it out based on need. In the past, we were shipping container loads to our distribution centers, and it wasn't as effective as it needed to be because we're filling those containers and those DCs with more product than they actually needed. So, by having these transload centers, what we're able to do is take the over and aboves, pare them down and ship them to the stores that actually need the product. So, it should have a benefit in our seasonal inventories and make us more nimble as we move forward rather than having more clearance on the backside. The last thing I'd tell you is it also allows us to build pallets of product for our stores so that the operations of the business, when it gets to the store, can be more efficient. In the past, it would all come in and have to be sorted out. These transload centers now will allow us to go ahead and pull together a lot of the seasonal product and ship it in 1 pallet to the stores. Benjamin Bienvenu : Great. Thanks for all that detail. And best of luck. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin : Certainly appreciate it that as a result of the tax legislation, you are making some reinvestments, particularly in the form of higher wages. But yet, if we look at your forecasted operating margin for 2018 of 8.8% at the midpoint, that's lower than where you were even five or six years ago. Is there -- at what point in time do you believe that all of these reinvestments, not only in wages, but other areas, at what point in time do you think that that will result in incrementally higher operating margins? And then I have a follow-up, please. Kurt Barton : Sure Alan. It's a good question. As we've said, in the last few years we've been making investments and you're seeing some of those investments and the impact on the operating margin. And our long-term goal is to grow operating margin annually. We believe that's achievable. And as I mentioned previously, our investments that we've been making, we believe we're making them in the right area, they're driving the long-term growth potential. Those sales growth opportunities -- typically in our plan that they would lag the initial investments. And those investments, over the last few years, are generally starting to plateau. So, when we look at that, we see that the investments and with the top line benefit our ability then to grow operating margin. So, we're very focused on 2018 right now. I would tell you that as we see the long-term, we're committed to our ability to grow the bottom-line profits. And we believe with those investments, the strength of the top line, you'll see operating margins improving. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. If we look at CPI and PPI data and listen to what the Fed is forecasted to do in 2018, there's certainly greater signs of inflation. As part of your 2% to 3% comp guidance and regardless of what inflation or deflation may be at the product level, are you contemplating perhaps taking prices up to help offset some of these higher costs? Steve Barbarick : Yes, this is Steve. I would tell you, we're going to be opportunistic. I mean, we constantly do a scan of the marketplace and where we see potential and opportunity, we take advantage of that. So, that is certainly on the table, and we will adjust accordingly. But we also want to make sure that it's balanced with market share, like we've always told you all. And we're making sure that we're doing the right thing for the long term of the business. So, if that opportunity presents itself, I can pretty much guarantee, we will take advantage of it. Alan Rifkin : Would you be a price leader or would you wait to see what competitors do? Steve Barbarick : Yes. I would tell you that there are markets we've got where we will certainly be price leaders, and there are markets that we're at where we'll be watching the market very closely. We are a test and learn company, we've got a price optimization tool that allows us to look at elasticity, and we will do just that. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you. best of luck in the New Year. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Paul Kearney : Hi guys. This is Paul Kearney calling on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. Gregory Sandfort : Hey Paul. Paul Kearney : Curious if you can maybe provide any detail on what you've learned from your core customers through the loyalty program? Steve Barbarick : Sure, this is Steve. One of the things that we've certainly learned is that they have a keen interest in wanting to build a stronger relationship with us. The enrollment that we've had today has exceeded our expectation and continues to be do so. I would also tell you those folks that are core customers that are part of the program, there's a higher engagement in terms of click through rates, open rates, redemption of offers. And we recently did a study, and this is pretty interesting. These folks have a high -- have a much higher statistically significant difference and their likelihood to recommend us to others, to return and their overall satisfaction with Tractor Supply Company is higher. So, there's a lot here that we're learning, they're coming in more often and when they do, they spend more. So, as we move forward, our focus is on continued enrollment and in continued engagement through personalization to drive more loyalty. If there's one thing that, I guess, to me looking back is a surprise, I would tell you it's the amount of activity that our core customers are coming to us and how often they come to us to buy their needs and get what they need. So, it's a much higher frequency rate than we had originally anticipated. And so now we're able to segment those customers off and talk to them in a more personalized manner. Paul Kearney : Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. I guess, qualitatively, how does the management team kind of look at balancing between growth and improving ROIC, I guess, over the short-term and longer term? And how important is ROIC as you make these investments through the year? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Paul, this is Kurt. We -- as Greg mentioned, we focus on both of those. We understand the importance of maintaining a good ROIC. The important thing for us as we look at it, maybe to share in regards to our perspective on it, is that we are making significant investments. These are key investments for the long term. And so during that time, as those investments may have -- take time to take hold on the topline, you're seeing some pressure on ROIC. But we do look at, with each investment, the return on investment and how we balance ROIC, it's part of our overall management. And I would tell you that we believe, with the investments we're making today, it not only drive the top line, but in the long term ROIC improvement. Paul Kearney : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Hi guys. Good afternoon everyone and welcome Mary Winn. Just on wages, wanted to follow up on that. You guys seem to be ahead of the curve in addressing this topic last quarter, specifically. I just wanted to know, has there been any real change in how you think about wages relative to last quarter, now that tax reform has been passed? And kind of related to that, it will be nice to revisit since you're a high growth retailer, one of the few that are opening stores, how do you think about finding employees, not store managers, but employees, in what is increasingly a tight labor market? Thanks. Gregory Sandfort : Hey Matt, this is Greg. Two things. One is changes from maybe a quarter to now. I think what we're seeing is we have a unique customer base. We have a unique team member that wants to work in Tractor Supply. Probably not the average person that would work in some of these other formats. They typically have a love for the lifestyle. They have a passion for living this lifestyle. So, we attract team members from those local communities because they enjoy the lifestyle, want to participate in it. And guess what? Working for Tractor Supply, they can get a discount on those things that they need. So, that's the first thing. We're not having a problem attracting those people. But some of the changes that we are seeing is there are some retail organizations that are making bold statements about we're going to have a minimum price guarantee to our team members of X, Y and Z. And here's how I look at that. And I've said this to our organization, I said we need to be priced very competitively, if not leading the market, in each of the markets where we have stores. We're in 49 states. Those 49 states are not equal. There's different challenges, there's different, I would call it, wage rates that need to be addressed. Some states are passing state laws that force some of that. Other states are not. So, we've taken a very proactive posture and said even in our 2018 planning, given some of the tax advantages that we have, we're going to stay not only very competitive on wages but, in many cases, we're going to be probably the person leading up in the wages because we need to make sure we've got the best people period. Matthew McClintock : If I could have a follow-up. Just on Buy Online Pickup in Store, the vast majority of your sales flow through that channel. I was just wondering you launched that capability impressively just a little bit more than a year ago, and now it's more than half of your sales. Did that mix shift towards Buy Online Pickup in Store cannibalize your existing e-commerce business or was it largely additive to your existing e-commerce business before? Steve Barbarick : Yes, this is Steve. No, it's been additive. As a matter of fact, we're seeing growth in both areas. So, comp store sales, so to speak, on the ship to side, continues to scale up. Matthew McClintock : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Best of luck. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks so much. Good afternoon guys. My first question relates to the investments that you've discussed. Is there a way to a portion how much of them relate to cyclical pressures, such as freight and shipping and labor as opposed to what you'd call strategic investments that don't relate at all to the cost backdrop? Kurt Barton : Yes, Matt, this is Kurt. The easiest way I could tell you is about 50% of the additional cost increases that we pointed out, I would bucket as investments and the other 50% are really more the cost pressures. And the transportation piece of that is probably the biggest one of that, 50% of that's cost pressures and the majority, the rest is the investments. Matthew Fassler : And should we think about that 50% that relates to investments basically being aligning with the piece of the tax windfall that you're reinvesting, is that the way to think about that relationship? Kurt Barton : Yes, about -- so about a little over a third is, as I mentioned, it's probably 20 basis points of the operating margin comes from our tax investments. So, it's not all 50% of it, but it's probably more than a third of that is from our conscious investment on the things we mentioned with the opportunity of the additional resources to invest in a key strategic part of our business such as our team members. We're investing in those areas. That's probably the right quantification of that. Matthew Fassler : Got you. And then separately, you mentioned in your remarks earlier that you're going to start to test subscription commerce. I'm wondering if the categories that would be most appropriate for subscriptions presumably largely in queue, align with the businesses where you currently have e-commerce penetration and what the shipping and logistic -- what the cost essentially -- logistics and shipping charges are cost -- associated with those categories will suggest for the return profile of that, if that were to take hold? Kurt Barton : Well, it's a great question. And one of the things we've got to do is find out whether or not our customers even have an interest in subscription to Tractor Supply Company. So, this is going to be a slow roll. It's going to be a test and learn. We're going to start with a few categories, see what kind of interest there is. The great thing about the opportunity and the tool is we can geo-target. There's a variety of things that we can do here so it doesn't get out ahead of us. And so it's going to be managed. And as we continue to scale, if it works, we'll be able to communicate to you along the way what impact that it has. Matthew Fassler : And Steve, would you say that Neighbor's -- the Neighbor's program, the data that you've obtained from it has indicated that your customers are purchasing with you the kind of consistency that will suggest a subscription would be a good fit? Steve Barbarick : That's a really good question. I would tell you that I think there might be some interest. I think we owe it to our customers, quite frankly. When you look at retail today, you get involved with where the market is going to go. And I believe we owe it to our customers through our idea of anytime, anywhere and anyway that whole idea of being a convenience for them. But I think we need to do it based on scale, we need to do it based on our ability to make sure we execute and offer the right customer service along the way. And we need to do it in a way for our shareholders that we don't do it so that it's going to be overly costly. So, we will manage this appropriately. But we do believe we owe it to them to at least offer that capability. Matthew Fassler : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Noah, I think we've hit the top of the hour, so I think we'll wrap up now. I'm going to turn it back over to Greg for a wrap up. I know we're leaving some people in the queue, so I apologize about that. My number is 615-440-4212, and I look forward to speaking to anyone that's interested in calling. So, please give me a call, and I'll turn it back to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Well, thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. I'm excited that we're going to be hosting our upcoming Annual Sales Meeting for over 3,000 of our Tractor Supply team members here in February. And during that same time, we're going to be hosting our Investment Community Day, that's scheduled for February 20 here in Nashville, where we plan to further discuss our strategic growth drivers for the long term with all of you. If you have any questions, as Mary said, please reach out to her. She'll be happy to help you if you have any further questions. And again, thank you for dialing in today. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

I'll be available after the call for follow-up as well. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. I'll start today's call by providing a review of the operational and financial highlights for the first quarter of 2018 and a few comments regarding our ONETractor strategy initiative. Steve will take you through several of the merchandising and marketing highlights, and Kurt will provide additional detail regarding our financial results and our financial outlook for the year. And then following that, we will open the call for questions. As I've stated already, we are very pleased with how the team managed through the first quarter, and we successfully controlled those elements that were in our control. Our results were driven by a broad-based strength across all geographic regions as well as increases in both comparable store transactions and average ticket. And all four merchandising divisions achieved positive comp sales in the quarter. Our first quarter results represent the third consecutive quarter of comp store sales running above a 3% comp. In addition, we achieved these sales results despite less than ideal conditions over the course of the first quarter given the late arrival of the spring season across many of our markets. As we have consistently shared with you over the years, we believe that our business should be viewed across the halves, not the individual quarters given the impact seasonality can have on where our sales will develop by quarter. Although we have continued to experience unseasonably cool weather in many of our markets thus far in April, I am pleased with our merchandise sales and current traffic trends in markets where we have experienced warmer spring like conditions. With a strong in-stock position and a strong product assortment, I am confident we are well-positioned to capitalize on the spring/summer selling season still ahead of us. We know our customers look to Tractor Supply for their everyday basic needs and living the rural lifestyle. We also understand that the continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and the updates to our in-store and online shopping experience are attractive, defensible, and are resonating with our customers. So now let me touch on a few highlights for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales increased 3.7% in the first quarter, with both transaction count and average ticket increasing in the quarter. This quarter marks 39 out of 40 quarters that our customer traffic count has been positive. Net sales increased 7.6% to $1.68 billion for the quarter as we continued our strategy to open new stores at both Tractor Supply and Petsense. Diluted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 24%. And we've returned $191 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter. And based upon our performance year-to-date, we are confirming our full year financial guidance. Now let's look at some of the operational highlights for the quarter. We celebrated the opening of our 1,700th Tractor Supply store in Mocksville, North Carolina. We opened 15 new Tractor Supply stores and four Petsense locations, including Petsense's first entry into Florida this quarter. We increased our Neighbor's Club loyalty program now over 7.6 million members, an increase of more than 400% since the national launch in April of last year. This quarter marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth in our e-commerce business. And during the quarter we continued to experience exceptional growth with our Buy Online, Pickup in Store program, exceeding our expectations. Between the combination of our Buy Online, Pickup in Store and direct delivery to stores, nearly 70% of our e-commerce orders are being fulfilled at our stores, and our stores continue to play a key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. We believe that our new capabilities of Buy Online, Pickup in Store, mobile POS, Neighbor's Club, and stockyard ordering position us uniquely to serve this customer base better than anyone in this incredibly fragmented market, and we see significant opportunities to broaden our customer base and increase our market share as our store base and digital capabilities expand over time. As we have stated, our ONETractor strategy is clearly aligned around four objectives : driving profitable growth, building customer-centric engagement, offering the most relevant products and services to our customers, and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We are building solid momentum behind our ONETractor strategy, and we believe this will ultimately drive momentum for stronger sales and profit growth in the coming years. We continue to take a balanced approach to managing our business, keeping the long-term in focus. In 2018 our capital spending is prioritized to new stores with an increase of capital dedicated to our customer insight and store-level service initiatives as well as our supply chain. As we shared with you last quarter, our recent update to our real estate modeling process continues to support the potential for upwards of 2,500 Tractor Supply locations over time, and we continue to be pleased with our new store productivity and returns. For 2018, we are on track to open 80 new Tractor stores and 20 new Petsense store locations. Our progress is resonating with our customers as evidenced by our sales growth and our outstanding ranking in a new ForeSee survey. Based on data from more than 40,000 shoppers across store, web, and mobile experiences assessing how likely they are to recommend a given retailer, our website ranked number one out of 50 retail websites included in the survey, something we're really proud of. So as we evolve as a company, I believe our ONETractor strategy positions us well to meet the unique preferences our customers have for demand-driven, immediate-need products in an easy and seamless shopping experience. With that being said, I'll now turn the call over to Steve for more details regarding several of our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I just wanted to take a moment this morning to give a brief update on product performance and progress that we're making on our merchandising initiatives through the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter, we had a solid comp store sales performance, driven by both increases in traffic as well as average ticket. We experienced positive comp store sales across all four walls of the store. We continue to experience strong sales in our C.U.E, consumable, usable, and edible products. And during the quarter, we had strong sales dollars and unit growth across categories such as pet food and treats, livestock feed and forage, as well as bird feeding and small animal products. These are stable categories that our customers depend on us for and drive repeat traffic to our stores. This quarter's performance reflects the commitment to being the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs for those customers that live the Out Here lifestyle. In addition to the strength of our C.U.E. business, colder than normal temperatures during the quarter also drove demand for winter seasonal merchandise. We experienced strong sales in categories such as livestock equipment, portable heating, long-sleeve apparel and footwear, along with snow removal products. However, toward the end of the quarter, we did experience a delay in our spring businesses. Departments such as power equipment, lawn and garden, as well as ag-related categories underperformed compared to company sales. We did see early signs of positive spring-like sales in the southern part of the country, but that was offset by colder temperatures in the north. Our in-stock position is in great shape and we're prepared to capture these sales when the temperatures normalize. Turning to merchandising initiatives, we're pleased with the new programs we added for the first quarter. The launch of the Husqvarna-branded chainsaws has resonated with our customer base and exceeded our early expectations. We anticipate continued sales growth in the woodcutting category, led by the Husqvarna brand and our new line of exclusive-branded log splitters through the remainder of the year. We continue to experience growth in categories that would be considered sustainable living or self-reliant to our customers. For example, we've expanded our assortment of poultry supplies, increased the number of stores carrying beekeeping products, and refined our assortment of live goods going in to the spring season. In addition to new products, we continue to gain market share with our exclusive brands of 4health and UNTAMED pet food. We experienced strong comp sales dollars as well as unit growth of these brands as customers are looking for high-quality pet food at an affordable price. We will support these brands with inventory, a strong value proposition, and broader assortments throughout the year. Our exclusive brand of Red Shed d\u00e9cor is also resonating with our customer base. We had a very successful holiday season with the brand. And we're off to a strong start for the spring season with our new lineup of farmhouse-themed d\u00e9cor. We talk a lot about the importance of retail theater. And during the quarter, we conducted our annual Chick Days event. Every spring, Tractor Supply customers look forward to the arrival of live chicks and ducklings. We offer everything a seasoned or novice backyard poultry keeper needs to care for their flock. Our stores carry an extensive line of chicken care and poultry products with an expanded assortment available online. We have had great sell-through and attachment rates within this category. As Greg mentioned, we continue to see strong traffic and sales from our website. The team continues to expand our online assortments with existing and new vendors that can drop-ship merchandise. Our online assortments are now up to over 100,000 SKUs that can be purchased. During the quarter, we also launched a test and learn for online subscription in pet food on TractorSupply.com as we look to gain a greater understanding of our customers' preferences and behavior with online purchasing. This is a great example of our effort to integrate the customer experience, supporting our ONETractor strategy. We are focused on providing increased convenience for our customers by using data analytics to better understand their expectations. As we anniversary the national rollout of Neighbor's Club, we now have one year of data to gain insights to allow for a more personalized shopping experience for our customers. Our new Vice President of CRM is now on board and we will continue to build out the analytics team to accelerate our capabilities and increase the relevance of our customer engagement. We're in the process of refining our customer segmentation and profiles that will allow us to gain a better understanding of the drivers of share of wallet with our Neighbor's Club members. With this approach, we have a greater opportunity to identify our most engaged customers and reinforce their loyalty to the Tractor Supply brand. When we learn our customers are passionate about their pets and animals, we're able to design specific messages, content, and offers that support what's most important to them. It demonstrates to these customers that we know them and what they care about. Specifically, our members show higher responsiveness to our targeted messages. For example, recent targeted messaging campaigns drove double-digit increase in our e-mail open rates and a nice improvement in click rates. These targeted campaigns provide information of value that our customers ultimately will drive more traffic and shopping with Tractor Supply. As we look forward, we believe we are ready for a solid selling season, with differentiated products and a customer engagement approach that will not only surprise and delight our customers, but allow them to live life on their terms. Now, I will turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2018, we had solid comp store sales growth of 3.7% which was driven by a 3.2% increase in comp transaction count and a 0.5% increase in our average ticket. For the quarter, we benefited from an additional selling day as we were open on New Year's Day for the first time. We estimate this incremental selling day added about 60 basis points to our comp performance in the quarter. January and March were the strongest months of the quarter, with January being the highest comp overall. Petsense comp store sales increase was close to our chain average. For the first quarter, gross margin increased 36 basis points to 33.5%. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by strong sell-through of winter seasonal categories partially offset by an increase in transportation cost from higher carrier rates and diesel fuel costs. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 89 basis points to 27.9%. The increase was primarily attributable to investment in wages for our team members at both the stores and distribution centers, higher store-level cost due to increased utilities and maintenance expenses from the extended colder temperatures, and investments in infrastructure to support our strategic long-term growth initiatives. We estimate that about 25 basis points of this increase is specific to factors in the first quarter that are not anticipated to reoccur in the balance of the year. Our effective tax rate decreased to 20.9% in the first quarter. The decrease was driven by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017 and the realization of some discrete federal and state tax credits which we estimate reduced our first quarter effective income tax rate by approximately 200 basis points. Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our working capital, and specifically our finance inventory, continues to improve as our accounts payable leverage was about 41.6% at the end of the first quarter. At quarter end, our merchandise inventories were $1.76 billion, an increase of 1% on a per-store basis from the 2017 first quarter. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are very comfortable with its quality. As the spring selling season continues to progress, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for spring and summer seasonal products. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. For the quarter we repurchased about 2.4 million shares of our common stock for $157.5 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per common share outstanding, totaling $33.6 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased nearly $2.3 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $712 million as of the quarter end. Turning now to our outlook. We have not made any changes to our full year outlook for sales or earnings in 2018 and continue to forecast net sales in the range of $7.69 billion to $7.77 billion, an increase of 6% to 7% over fiscal 2017. Comparable store sales in the range of 2% to 3%. Net income in the range of $490 million to $515 million, and earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.15. Also, consistent with our outlook as we came into 2018 in terms of cadence, we continue to anticipate stronger comp store sales and earnings performance in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. As we experienced a delay to the start of spring, we expect the shift of the timing of sales for spring-related products to later in the season, with the potential to have a prolonged season in some regions. Given the comparisons for 2017, we continue to expect comp sales to be at or above our full year guidance range in the first half of the year and below the full year guidance range in the second half of the year. We expect gross margin rate to be flat to slightly down for the remainder of the year. For the balance of the year, we expect the SG&A increase as a percentage of net sales to continue around the rate of the first quarter, excluding the approximately 25 basis points of discrete items specific to the first quarter, keeping in mind that for the fourth quarter of 2018, however, the trends in both gross margin and SG&A shift a bit given our lapse for the fourth quarter of 2017 as we have a more difficult comparison on gross margin and an easier comparison on SG&A. For our fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate, we continue to forecast a range of 23% to 23.5%, albeit towards the low end of the range. Please keep in mind the first quarter discrete tax items have a greater impact on the first quarter as it is our smallest quarter of the year, and we do not anticipate these items reappearing over the balance of the year. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, with our first priority being reinvestments back into the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. For 2018 we remain on track to open about 80 new Tractor Supply stores, 20 new Petsense stores, and substantial completion of our new distribution center in Frankfort, New York. We are also committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and continued share repurchases. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Kurt. And what I'd like to say is thank you, and I'd like to reinforce how appreciative I am of our entire team's efforts during the first quarter of 2018. Our more than 28,000 team members bring our mission and values to life every day as they serve our Out Here lifestyle customers. We have a wonderful business which addresses a unique niche operated by exceptional team members, and I am proud to be on their team. With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: All right. Alex, we can open up for questions, please. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Greg, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey, Michael. How are you? Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, good. You guys outlined a lot of initiatives that contributed to your very good traffic performance in the first quarter, but you were also doing a lot last year. So how should we think about what drove the very strong improvement in traffic that was the best we've seen in some time and how sustainable is the traffic growth that you saw in the first quarter moving forward? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Michael, I'll take that one and Steve may deal with the follow-on. We talk about being the most dependable supplier, and in the first quarter we clearly saw an extension of the winter selling season. So being nimble with our supply chain we were able to, I'll call it this, reload and address many of those needs as they move through that quarter. And those footsteps are generated by people who need what we sell, so having that inventory available and being able to react appropriately I think is what drove the footsteps. The C.U.E. business continued to perform well. When you've got that type of weather, you're going to see your food and feed businesses accelerate as well as forage. So I would tell you being in-stock, being there for our customer is probably what, I would say, drove the footsteps. Steve, you must have something you want to add? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: I have nothing to add. I think that was a good assessment of the quarter. (25:13) Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, it's sustainable so that's the right way to think about traffic for the rest of the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: I think we would say yes because our plans are, as you saw, we were about 1% up in inventory in total which would relatively mean flat. But it's the investment in the right inventory that we've done I think a remarkable job with over the years. We run a tight ship, albeit an awesome one, one's that's very directed to the needs of the customer and by the regions of the country. So I don't anticipate any slowdown, I really don't. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: The one thing I would add there, Michael, is well Q1, the weather was helpful. We've had got a good run of traffic in our stores. And as Greg mentioned, I think 39 out of 40 quarters. I will tell you we continue to pick up share in a lot of these C.U.E. businesses as Greg mentioned, and the team's focus around those C.U.E. businesses is really paying dividends. As Greg mentioned, our in-stock positions are better, we continue to build out our assortments, and we're making sure that we're priced right to get that traffic in and have those folks really become loyalists. So I would anticipate, when you look at the core business, for the strength of that to continue. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And my quick follow-up question is Kurt mentioned that March was a strong month, and I think the expectation was given the weather that moved through the middle and eastern portion of the country, that it was going to be a drag on the business. So where there just regions that offset that or was it not as much of an impediment as was expected? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Michael, this is Kurt. As we look at the quarter, as Greg mentioned the strength of our quarter, we capitalized on the colder weather seasons even into the month of March but also we're able to see strength in the month of March on our core everyday products. So the way we assess March is that we were able to see some strength in the cold weather product along with the core side of the business that was able to somewhat offset the softness in a delayed spring season. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you so much. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks very much and good morning. My first question is around the online growth. I'm just wondering \u2013 I may have missed this, but can you guys talk about the online growth? I don't know if you quantified that. Maybe just the total growth and what it's contributing to the comps. And in general, it's good to see that it's tied to the store. Any more color around the types of categories that you're seeing growing and what is actually driving that? How much of it is driven by the need, the immediacy? How much of it is big ticket items, things like that? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. What I would tell you is that in 2018 we anticipate the online business to do somewhere between 2% and 3% of our total sales, and it is growing, as Greg mentioned, 23 straight quarters of double-digit comps. And you got to look at it from a couple different perspectives. The first I would tell you is Greg mentioned the importance of the store, and I just want to reiterate that. About half of our online business today is Buy Online, Pickup in Store. And that portion of our business is in some of the core businesses that we have, and you'll see that in fencing and a variety of categories where customers are looking for convenience. In many cases, a lot of our customers have folks that work with them that can go in now and pick up the product since the purchase has already been made, and there's a tremendous benefit to a lot of that when we're out traveling stores and talking to our team members. I think that business will continue to grow because it is convenience. The next element is ship to store, and many of the ship to store products are products that we don't carry within the four walls of the store today. So they're really incremental sales that customers are purchasing, coming into the store and buying. And then the last element is the product that is actually shipped to customer or shipped to home, house, however you want to look at it. And that business, again, has probably a good mix of both new products that our customers are looking for that the box may not have as well as some products that are inside the four walls, but they just want it delivered for them from a convenience perspective. The categories that we're seeing grow vary across all categories within the box itself. There's not any one specific category. I will mention one last thing here and that is as we did, as I mentioned, initiate our subscription program, it is a relatively small part of the overall portfolio of what we're selling today online, but we're learning a lot of really interesting things about what our customers want. And a lot of those things are brands like 4health. I mean, we're seeing a pretty high concentration and penetration of sales there as well as some of the branded products. So again, it kind of all goes back to this one integrated experience and really the value ONETractor brings, that whole strategy. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, Steve. Thanks so much for that color, really appreciate it. One follow-up for Kurt, the discrete SG&A items from the first quarter, I'm just wondering was that factored into your original guidance, the EPS guidance for the full year? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Seth, that's a good question. On the 25 basis points, I would say part of it is and part is not. There's really three factors in that. The most significant part is what I mentioned in that the colder weather brought higher store occupancy costs specific to utility, other maintenance-related type items. And that necessarily was \u2013 with colder temperatures than expected, it wasn't in the factors. The other half of that is in a couple other areas we had some specific costs, corporate leave, related to employee benefits, specifically to medical, that were in the long-term, part of our overall cost structure for 2018, but specific to the first quarter. As well as we ramped up our West and East Coast transport centers and staged spring import seasonal products to allow us to be ready to distribute quickly to the right forward locations, having that ramped up in lieu (31:52) gave a little bit of additional cost specific to the pre-spring seasonal that, again, discrete to Q1. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you for all the color. Appreciate it. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Steve. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : You briefly mentioned in the prepared remarks two programs, right, Neighbor's Club and Buy Online, right? But now that we cycled Neighbor's Club, the national rollout, and we're about to cycle BOPIS, can you just provide additional commentary on how these programs are maturing relative to your expectations? And maybe comment on how you expect them to impact trends, right, with the arrival of spring as it relates to both ticket and traffic, right? Because I think part of the goal here was to reaccelerate ticket. So any color there would be appreciated. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, great. This is Steve. Let me take that one. First off, I've already talked a little bit about the Buy Online, Pickup in Store program. We'll continue to communicate that message to our customers because we think that there's great value in that. And over time, I think that that will continue to grow as more and more people gravitate toward it. Our operations team has done a fantastic job making sure that we're taking care of our customer. And that, like as I said, will continue to expand. In terms of Neighbor's Club, there's more color probably here I can give you. It has anniversaried now. We have hired a VP of CRM and we're building out the analytics team today. And we're really digging down into the information. And it's given us a better sense of who and what our customers are looking for from us because now we're able to capture the whole 360 of that customer. And even in Q1 itself, we were able to alter some of the e-mail communication going out to these customers because we've got all these new e-mail addresses talking longer about the weather up north where we could support, and that helped us during Q1 drive some of those cold weather sales. And at the same time, while it was getting warm down south, we were able to geo-target some of those customers and get out in front of that as well. So that's going to do nothing but add longer-term value. Looking at segmentation, being able to communicate to you all in the future on frequency of shop, on spend by customer now that we've anniversaried this, is all into the future. And I will tell you that the enrollment of our Neighbor's Club program is giving us confidence that in the long haul, we'll be able to use this as a real sales driver and loyalty tool for the future. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you, and then just a quick follow-up. I know we talked about this at the Analyst Day briefly, but can you expand on I guess some more recent thoughts of the downstream capabilities or initiatives of the DC network, right? Obviously, BOPIS is resonating, but how do you think about the choices you're going to provide to customer as it relates to home delivery? You mentioned the subscription test, but really what are you thinking about the evolution of your value prop as it relates to that? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Steve again. I would tell you that we're actually very proactive in this front. Kurt mentioned a few things. I will tell you that as we look forward, we are working on three or four different tests on delivery today. And delivery from store is still something that we're working toward in testing. So as customers continue to tell us what they're looking for from us as we move forward with many of these initiatives, we will continue to evolve with the needs of those customers. And I think we're really well-positioned with 1,700 stores across the United States to be able to accommodate their needs. And using our stores really as a central hub, not just for them to come in but for us to ship from, is going to be a real differentiator for us into the future. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much and good morning, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: My first question just relates to the cadence of sales during the quarter. You commented on January and March and the fact that March was a good month. If you think about the net impact of the weather based on the quarter and of March as well, I understand that winter products are better; spring products obviously worse. How did weather net out do you think versus your expectations for the quarter and, in particular, for the month of March? How would you say that netted out relative to expectations? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, let me go ahead and start with that, Matt. What I would tell you is when we got through the first four weeks of the year, we were feeling pretty good about the way that the sales cycle looked. And figuring what we had already put behind us and with a normal spring, I think we probably would have actually exceeded the comp sales that we had for Q1. If you look at March specifically, Tractor Supply has done a really nice job building out a cold weather business up north. And as that business kind of stayed up there, I will tell you that I can't say that we traded sales between spring and north equally. I think we gave up some opportunity quite frankly on the upside when it came to the spring season from the northern part of the country. But we were able to get some benefit from keeping and being nimble on a lot of the cold weather products and working with our vendors to make sure \u2013 we were spoon-feeding those stores up north to capture every possible sale that we could. At the same time, if you look at the southern part of the country, March didn't play all that bad. We were able to get some benefit from a lot of the southern parts of the U.S. Unfortunately, it just wasn't enough to offset the lack of spring that we had up north. Now as we look forward, what I can tell you is as we've been through plenty of cycles here at Tractor Supply Company, weather is a factor when you support a customer that lives Out Here, and we anticipate that the grass will grow up north and it will get warmer, and we're prepared to capture those sales. The big question for me, having been through many of these cycles, is how many of those will we capture here in Q2 and will there be any prolonged or spillover into the early part of third quarter. That's the one thing for the northern tier right now that we're watching very closely, and we're making sure that our supply chain and our vendors are ready to strike if that is the case. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: My brief follow-up. So at the end of the fiscal year as you entered Q1, you said as you did this morning that you expected stronger same-store sales and earnings growth in the first half of the year. I believe you also indicated at that time that you thought the first quarter would have the highest comp and the lowest level of operating margin compression. I know that you reiterated the point on the first half and encouraged us, as you always do, to think about the business in terms of halves. Do you care to update the comment on Q1 relative to the rest of the year? Does that statement still hold or is it tougher to say given the impact that the weather had on Q1? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Matt, this is Kurt. I would say it's so early in the season, and the impact like Steve said on Q2, it's really hard to predict that. I'll go back to what we've said when you look at the halves that we anticipate that the first half will have a higher comp than the second half. We anticipate that the first half, the best we see it today, will be at/or potentially above the annual range of a 2% to 3% comp for 2018. So we believe that when the spring season hits, it accelerates pretty fast with the warm weather. And so to Steve's point, whether that hits in what particular period or does it spillover, that's yet to be seen. A lot of the season ahead of us. As we predict out, and you look at Q1's performance, it still could end up being the strongest comp performance for the year. But as you look at Q2 and Q3, that still blends out to a comp in the first half of the year as to what we guided. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was wondering what you'd focus on looking forward. Steve, can you talk a little bit about what you're most excited about from a merchandising standpoint this year in terms of your initiatives and thinking about that acceleration that Kurt just talked about? And then could you tie that in a little bit to big ticket and how we should think about improvement and/or acceleration in that specific part of your business going forward? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. I always like getting a question about what am I getting excited about because I get excited about a lot of things. One of the things I would tell you is, having been with the organization as long as I have, there's probably as much energy and enthusiasm that I've seen quite frankly in a long window of time just because there are so many exciting things going on. In terms of product, I would tell you, and I mentioned earlier, the Husqvarna brand continues to exceed our expectations. And we're not giving up on branded products whatsoever. There's a variety of things we're doing within the box along with some Scotts product and a few other categories and tools that I think are really going to help move our business forward. In addition to that, we're making good strides in a lot of our exclusive brands and private brands. And whether it's the launch of these, whether it's getting behind them with more social media, we're really seeing these brands resonate with our customers and that's driving some loyalty. The last comment I would make on product is even the inside of our stores. So many of you maybe know that we've got this ONETractor concept store. So far we've got, I guess, now we're up to four stores that have opened; three new, one retrofit. All of them are exceeding their original forecast in terms of sales. As we move forward, we're going to be adding probably 40, 50 of our new stores into this concept as well as retrofitting a number of stores because we think it's adding value to the box, our customers, and our own operational efficiencies. That's really on the product side. The only last thing I'll share with you is I wouldn't minimize the benefit we're going to get from customer engagement. There's a lot of activity taking place there, and I think us being able to reach out to our consumers through e-mail and building that out is really critical to the future of our organization. And the last thing, and Greg said it very well, is really all the energy we've got around our ONETractor initiatives and what we're doing with online and fusing the box along with the digital side of our business so that we're really this whole idea of ONETractor and the ONETractor brand. Specifically to ticket, we've got a variety of things that we brought into the stores that are at a little higher price points, and we still see opportunity there. We're working on a financing program that's a little more competitive than what we maybe have seen in the past that we think will add value. But we really won't know the value of that financing program until we get a little further into the season and see how it resonates with our customers with a lot of the OPE lines that we have. But it's something that we're working on. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for that color. Operator : We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I want to follow-up something Matt asked and Steve commented on regarding the weather. You've gone through a lot of cycles and you've seen a lot of patterns. In this case, we have witnessed a late April and I think spring still hasn't arrived. So in those instances, I wanted to talk about pent-up demand. I realized it's pretty fluid but how do you think about like riding mowers for example? Would we not just sell the same number or that's still very possible depending on the extent of the season? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Let me start with that one, and we get that question, it's a great question to have. A couple thoughts. First off, we do have stores in 49 states which benefits us as an organization, so we're not geographically confined to just the northern tier of the country. If we were, I would tell you that I would certainly be even more anxious. I do believe that when it comes to mowers in spring, it's a little different than in the colder season, and I say that because you can delay buying jackets an insulated if you get close to the end of the season. But if you break your lawnmower, you need a lawnmower. And so for us knowing that there's still this window in front of us, we believe we're going to capture the vast majority of what the needs of our customers are going to be. The key for Tractor is making sure that we're nimble enough to have the inventory there when we get the rush of customers that all come in within the short window of time potentially. That's the key. And so our supply chain is working right now. You heard Kurt talk about the investments in these transload centers. And our DC network is prepared to start pushing that trigger on an as-needed basis as the weather continues to get warmer and warmer. So I think we're really in a good solid position. We just got to make sure that it's incumbent upon us now to capture the demand that comes in based on our levels of inventory. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my related follow-up is if you're seeing any infection in big ticket from the TSC credit card offer or weather is just the bigger gatekeeper on ticket and then we'll see stronger growth as the season plays out? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Simeon, this is Kurt. As Steve mentioned when he address the financing earlier, I would say it's very early in our season. But in regards to watching where we've started, you may have seen in our stores the additional deferred financing programs, the emphasis on low monthly payments that resonates with our customer. I would tell you while very early we are pleased with the upside that we see, and we believe it's a key part to combining and be able to partner with the merchandising, new assortments, bigger ticket items, and the ability to sell with it. We will have more information at the end of Q2 where we're able to talk more about the benefit from the new financing programs. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Kurt. Operator : We will take our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys, and nice job navigating a tough weather environment. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Peter. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Now with the drum beat of inflation picking up in particularly with some of the areas like steel and oil that you guys sell, could you give us an update on how you're navigating this environment and maybe if you're raising price or maintaining price? And on a related note, Kurt, if you could give us any inflation or deflation impact to comps for the quarter as well? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. I'll start with that and then I'll let Steve follow on that. In regards to what we see, for first quarter we've seen now a net modest benefit from inflation during the first quarter and we continue to take a strong look at and we monitor those key input items, the corn, the petroleum, and the steel side of it, and those items can vary a bit. I would say that some of the inflation in the first quarter that we saw came from areas specific to heating. So that may be discrete to a Q1 but we're anticipating that we'll continue to see some net modest inflation throughout the rest of the year. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: And Peter, the only thing I would add is, first off, I'm going (48:29) on talking about deflation; it seems like we're talking about deflation for years. One of the benefits we have are the pricing tools we've talked about. The investments we've made in a lot of these pricing tools have given us a better insight into the elasticity of the product. Where we can move ahead retails as prices come toward us, we do. But we're watching it very, very closely with all the tools that we've got. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much, guys. And then a follow-up. Kurt, in the prepared remarks you mentioned that you expect certain regions could see a longer spring selling season. I guess could you give us a little more detail around that or what are you seeing that gives you that type of conference? And are you talking about summer season extending as far as into Q3 and maybe seeing some benefits as we look out beyond Q2? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, yeah. It's the latter that you referred to. What I would say is it's not as much of what we've seen today as much as historically as we've seen this. As there's colder weather there's also, in the last few months, higher moisture \u2013 February, March, and even April. And historically, as we've seen that, that bodes well for the spring selling season when that warm weather comes, but also allowing us in certain geographic markets to have that prolonged season, and Steve spoke to that in regards to the north and other areas. So we look at it and say there is the potential for that as you're trying to assess where these spring sales may occur throughout the cadence of the year. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right, sounds great. Keep up the good work. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Elizabeth L. Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Can you estimate what percentage of your sales are in product categories that your customer really can't get anywhere else or at least not at any of the major big box retailers, like you can't find live chicks at Walmart, as far as I know. So how much of your traffic or how much of what you sell is in those unique Tractor Supply products compared to more competitive product categories? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Liz, this is Steve. And I'm not sure that we've necessarily broken it out and defined it exactly that way. And the reason I say that is that even in for 4health, we've got a strong following, but it's pet food, right? And so if you're in the business and you just need pet food, you can buy pet food, but we see the value of that product. So we know a third of our business is in private-branded product. In addition to that, we do carry brands that are somewhat unique to our channel as well as to Tractor Supply, and I'll use the example of things like Bad Boy Mowers. Even MTD, to a certain extent, is more dealer-based, but they work with Tractor and not a lot of the farm and ranch chains; the Purina Checkerboard. So I'd almost need to go through and really work hard to try to come up with a real good specific answer for you. Where we focus most is on differentiation. So I'll use one last example and leave you with that, and that is 5-gallon buckets of lubricants are much more important to us than consumer passenger motor oil. And that's where our focus traditionally has been and that's what differentiates us from many of the big boxes or even the pet specialty chains is where we think we can win. So that's the best I can do to try to quantify. Elizabeth L. Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And you talked about your pricing tools. How many of the stores are using digital price tags now that you can update instantaneously? And is there a plan to use that more broadly so that you can be more nimble as input pricing changes? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Great question. We're today using the digital pricing tools in just a handful of categories and just a few stores. And really, it's to get a read on it, how it works operationally for Tractor Supply Company. Do I see a mass rollout of this anytime soon? Probably not. But we're a test and learn company. And as we get more findings and understanding of how that operates, we'll move forward with it. We feel like we're in a pretty good position the way we're managing it today. We can be pretty nimble the way we operate, but it is something that's being tested. Elizabeth L. Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think one of the big questions out there is the margin outlook beyond 2018. If you back out the tax impact, earnings were roughly flat year-over-year, and the way that the year has shaped from a guidance and consensus perspective is that the sort of EBIT declines deteriorate throughout the year. So what drives the inflection around operating profit rate as you transition past 2018? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Chris. This is Kurt. I would start by saying this. As we look at first quarter and even outlook into the next couple quarters, I mean, we're executing the plan that we laid out and it's consistent with our expectations. The cost pressures are relatively in line with our expectations. And we said that 2018, we'd be facing transportation cost new levels. We'd be investing in our wages and our labor of our team members as well as ONETractor. So the key answer to your question is two things. One, those are a step up in the investments in 2018 that we'll cycle and leverage in 2019 and beyond. And these investments in ONETractor, a number of the things we've just talked about, are starting to take hold. And you combine the plateauing of that, of the cost pressures with the tailwinds and benefit from our investments, is where we believe the operating profit margins begin to rebound back beyond 2018. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Then, as a follow-up, can you talk about how Texas and the energy markets and ag markets performed? If you go back couple years ago, that was a drag on the business. Are those markets now outperforming the total comp? And how would you describe just how that's changed because I think last quarter perhaps Texas and energy was more in line with the company average. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Chris, I'll start on that. This is Kurt. And I would say with the Texas market, I will say that in general for the first quarter, they had more normalized weather than some of the other parts of it. So the performance in the Texas-Oklahoma area, southwest, was strong for the first quarter. And I would say a part of that is we're starting to see a transition from that being a headwind to neutralize to actually a bit of a start of a tailwind, nothing of a robust nature that we saw a handful of years ago. And in the ag and farm economy areas, most of that is in the Midwest area. And at this point, the weather is a bigger factor than anything. And when you look at Q1, hard to say whether or not the ag economy had any impact and it's more of a weather factor at this point. And last thing I'd say is what we've said. Our customer is not the production ag customer and ag farm economy does not have a strong correlation necessarily to our comp performance. Weather has a greater impact to it in that industry. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Good luck for the rest of spring. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So Greg, I noticed in your monologue that you did a great job outlining the ONETractor initiatives, and we fully support what you guys are doing there and I think you have a large opportunity I think as you outlined. Maybe the one missing ingredient for us is when we go through the proxy and we look at how the incentives are for management, there's no ROIC in their at all, and ROIC has always been the number one indicator of future equity performance over one really multi-year period. I guess I was just a little surprised because it doesn't seem \u2013 ONETractor does seem like a kind of longer-term kind of framework but it doesn't seem like management's incentivized to look at ROIC. I was wondering if you could have a comment on that. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Well Scott, there's multiple ways to look at ROIC from a standpoint how it incorporates into either a direct correlation or an indirect correlation to compensation. We have always looked at it as a component of, not a singular component to itself. And we have a very robust, as you know, process for allocation of capital. It's been very time-tested and it's been productive. But when you look at the overall performance of any company, if you look at one or two individual measures, I think you start to look at the short side of what literally drives the company. And when we look at our measurements behind our compensation program, they are designed for performance. You have to perform to pay. And so yes, ROIC is an element. It's discussed. It isn't a singular item that we look at but it is part of the conversation that we have every year. And net income to me is one of the better factors to look at because I can start to manipulate, if I was one of the members of management, certain elements; ROIC could be one, there could be others. I like to look at the combination of the entire package and say listen, at the bottom line net income of the company is what the shareholders also are interested in. And we believe the package, the way it's structured, delivers the right results. It's been time-tested and I don't see any reason to change at this point. Kurt, you want to have any comment? (59:33) Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: The only thing, as an example, what you don't see in the proxy is the emphasis we have on ROIC. And we've mentioned a couple times, even at the Analyst Day, our operational efficiency and productivity initiatives, and ROIC is a core part of that because management looks at and is accountable to key factors and measurements that build up to, and we focus on ROIC. So I just want to use that as an example to emphasize ROIC is part of one of our top few driving metrics for performance within Tractor Supply. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: All right. Okay, Scott, go ahead. I'm sorry. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : No, no, Mary Winn. That's fine. I can follow-up offline. Appreciate you guys squeezing me in. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure thing. Operator, I know we've gone just a minute past the top of the hour, so I think we'll end the call there. I think Greg, you want to wrap up the call? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Let me just say that I want to reiterate that the business model here at Tractor Supply is solid, and we're excited about the growth prospects not only for this year but for years to come. As we have shared with you, we do have a solid plan and we have the ability to become flexible and nimble with how the business can develop over the year based upon our position of strength and how we believe we can take more market share as we focus on creating longer-term shareholder value for the company and for our shareholders. So with that, if you have any other further questions Mary Winn will be available afterwards. We thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply and we look forward to talking to all of you very soon. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: All right. Operator, that will now conclude our call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We'll be available after the call for follow-ups. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. I'll start today's call by providing a review of the operational and financial highlights for the quarter. Steve will take you through several of the merchandising and marketing highlights, along with several of our key priorities. Then Kurt will provide additional detail regarding our financial results and outlook for the year. Following that, we will open the call for questions. So, overall, we achieved a strong second quarter. Our results were driven by broad-based strength across all geographic regions as well as increases in both comparable average ticket and traffic. And all four merchandising divisions achieved positive comp sales in the quarter. Our second quarter results represent the fourth consecutive quarter of comp store sales above 3%. And during the quarter, the Tractor Supply team was very nimble across store operations, merchandising and planning, which allowed us to capitalize on the spring selling season as it arrived across all of our markets. At the same time, we were there for our customers with our everyday basic assortments that we know our customers depend on from Tractor Supply to help them live the Out Here lifestyle. I believe that the macro backdrop for our consumer is relatively healthy given recent trends in unemployment and consumer confidence. And for Tractor Supply, the macro headwinds we have experienced over the last several years have abated somewhat and the team is in a position to capitalize on the current consumer trends. We are experiencing some benefits from the energy-related markets, along with modest inflation, all of which are positively contributing to our top-line performance. Now that we are at the halfway mark for the year, we are raising our full-year outlook given the strength in the first half. Looking ahead, we believe our merchandising and marketing initiatives, along with our ONETractor strategy, have us well positioned for the second half of the year. So, let me touch on a few highlights for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter last year. Net sales increased 9.7% to $2.2 billion for the quarter as we continued our strategy to open new stores at both Tractor Supply and Petsense. Comparable store sales increased 5.6% in the second quarter with comp average ticket increasing 3.7% and transactions growing at plus 1.8% in the quarter. This quarter marks 40 out of 41 quarters that our customer traffic count has been positive. It's the best average ticketing increase we have had in the last six years. Diluted EPS was $1.69, an increase of 35%. Year-to-date, we have returned $324 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchase and cash dividends. And during the second quarter, we increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year as we look to return cash to shareholders. This year, our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 14.8%. And based upon our performance year-to-date, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.10 to $4.20, up from our previous guidance range of $3.95 to $4.15. Now, let's take a look at several of the operational highlights of the quarter. We opened 25 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense locations with one Petsense closure. All metrics of our customer satisfaction scores improved year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program now with over 8.7 million members as we are well on track to meet our goal of 10 million Neighbor's Club members by the end of this year. This quarter marks the 24th consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth in our e-commerce business. And during the second quarter, we continued to experience exceptional growth with our Buy Online Pick Up In Store program, again, exceeding our expectations. Between the combination of our Buy Online Pick Up In Store and direct delivery to the stores, more than 70% of our e-commerce orders are being fulfilled at our stores, illustrating the importance of our store assets and their key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. Importantly, this is a very cost-effective way to serve our customers with greater speed and efficiency. We believe that with our capabilities of Buy Online Pick Up In Store, mobile point of sale, Neighbor's Club, and stockyard ordering capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to serve this customer base better than anyone in this incredibly fragmented market. And we see opportunities to broaden our customer reach and increase our market share as our store base and digital capabilities expand over time. Our ONETractor strategy remains focused on four objectives : Driving profitable growth, building customer-centric engagement, offering the most relevant products and services, and finally, enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We are building solid momentum behind our ONETractor strategy to serve our customers anytime, anywhere, and any way they choose. We continue to believe this will drive our performance in the coming years. For 2018, we are on track to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 20 new Petsense store locations. And we continue to be pleased with our new store productivity and returns. I believe our ONETractor strategy positions us well to meet the unique preferences our customers have for demand-driven, immediate-need products in an easy and seamless shopping experience. We also believe that the continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and the updates to our in-store and online shopping experience are attractive, defensible and are resonating with our customers. Now, before I turn the call over to Steve, I would like to make a few comments on the proposed China tariffs. Please keep in mind, we have a large segment of our business, such as our consumable, usable and edible products, that would not be impacted at all. Depending on the product category, we would look to mitigate potential tariffs through a combination of alternative sources of supply or adjustment of our consumer pricing, as appropriate. For 2018, we really do not see any material impact to our financial outlook for the proposed tariffs, but we will continue to watch this topic closely as negotiations continue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to take a moment this morning to give you a brief update on product performance during the quarter, the progress we're making on building out our capabilities to support future sales growth, and a look forward to the back half of the year. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter, we had a solid comp store sales performance, driven by both average ticket as well as continued increases in traffic. The team was well prepared to benefit from the delayed spring selling season with a great lineup of merchandise in our stores as well as online. Our strong average ticket growth of 3.7% was positively impacted by product mix, mainly from growth in our big-ticket items as well as slight commodity inflation. We experienced positive comp sales growth in big-ticket merchandise across the number of product lines during the quarter. Products such as generators, truck boxes, and log splitters, all experienced solid comp sales. But big-ticket was mainly driven by zero turn and front engine riding mowers. We were able to capitalize on the mower business as the result of a new and expanded product lineup, and took advantage of the favorable weather trends during the quarter. For the quarter, commodity price inflation of higher grain prices and, to a modest degree, oil and steel products added approximately 75 basis points to the average ticket. Turning to traffic, we benefited from consistent performance in our everyday merchandise, otherwise known as consumable, usable and edible, or C.U.E. products. During the quarter, we had strong sales dollars and unit growth across these C.U.E. categories. As a company, our mission is to be a dependable supplier of basic maintenance products, and it's these products that drive repeat traffic to our stores. We continue to experience strength in product lines such as pet food and supplies, livestock feed, forage products, and bird feeding. As it pertains to the pet food business, we not only experienced top dollar sales, but also had an increase in comp units, which is something we track very closely. Our exclusive brand of 4health continues to gain traction in the industry, and has become an increasingly important part of our pet food portfolio. Lastly, we took advantage of favorable weather trends during the quarter. We experienced strength in our seasonal businesses such as outdoor power equipment, lawn and garden products, live goods, along with spring seasonal decor. All in, the second quarter was very well balanced across our merchandising categories and geographic regions. Our supply chain did an excellent job staying nimble and managing to the needs of the business, supporting a solid in-stock position throughout the quarter. Now, let me turn to the progress we're making on building on our capabilities in support of our customer. We are pleased with the traction that we're gaining and our customers' early response to these initiatives. Specific examples include capabilities such as expanding the functionality of our website, increasing the store count of our stockyard kiosk and mobile point-of-sale system, growing our Neighbor's Club engagement, enhancing our private label credit card offering, and investing in our supply chain. As part of our ONETractor strategy, we continue to enhance the functionality of our website and mobile platform with features to support our seamless shopping experience. We have several work streams underway to build on our momentum with the addition of complementary features. For example, we continue to introduce more payment options online. And just this month, functionality has been added to our website to allow customers the ability to register for and to make tax-exempt purchases. The ongoing expansion of the stockyard kiosk in select stores will allow us to provide even more customers with the long tail of product assortment. We now have more than 100,000 SKUs on our website compared to the 15,000 to 20,000 in an individual store. At the store level, the stockyard kiosks are a proven tool for driving increment sales. The rollout of these kiosks, along with the expansion of our mobile point-of-sale technology, ramps up in the second half of the year. By the end of the year, we anticipate an incremental 400 to 500 stores will have the stockyard kiosks, and the mobile point-of-sale capability will be implemented in an additional 300 stores. Our Neighbor's Club membership continues to be very strong. At just over a year old since our national rollout, this is a transformational and growing asset to drive brand loyalty. With a one-year retention rate at nearly 90%, our customer feedback continues to be overwhelmingly positive and key engagement metrics for the second quarter improved sequentially. Our sales per customer are up in the year post enrollment with Neighbor's Club members shopping three to four times our non-member customers. As mentioned last quarter, we're in the process of refining our customer segmentation based on the rich data that we're getting from our loyalty program. The data allows us to target specific customer groups based on their frequency and category-specific needs. This personalized approach will allow us to drive engagement and share of wallet over time. Being a relationship-based retail company, we are in the process of personalizing communication digitally to mirror the experience one has in our stores. In addition to our Neighbor's Club program, our enhanced private label credit card offering has resonated with our customers. While still very early, we have seen the use of our private label credit card increase across the board as a result of more compelling financing offers. Credit card applications are up and the percentage of sales on the card has increased every period since our new offers went into effect in March of this year. Over time, we anticipate this to become a key tool in deepening our relationship with our customers, drive loyalty and increase our share of wallet. Lastly, we continue to make investments across our supply chain. During the second quarter, we utilized our two import transload centers effectively to allocate and flow seasonal products to markets based on sales patterns. During the third quarter, we plan to open a new mixing center in Georgia. This will be our fourth mixing center, helping us to provide just-in-time replenishment of fast-turning C.U.E. and high C.U.E. products to our stores. Our distribution center in Frankfort, New York is on track to begin receiving in the late fourth quarter and begin shipping to stores in the first quarter of 2019. The Frankfort distribution center will support replenishment to our stores and increase fulfillment speed for direct-to-customer orders. Now, let me briefly highlight a few merchandising initiatives for the back half of the year. We anticipate continued sales growth in our wood-cutting category, led by the Husqvarna branded chainsaws and our exclusive brand of CountyLine log splitters throughout the remainder of the year. We have also put together a strong assortment of heating products and will be ready to support our customers early in the season, should there be demand. We talk a lot about the importance of retail theater and during the third quarter, we'll be having our fall Chick Days event across the vast majority of our chain. We expanded the event to additional stores this year based on the success we experienced last year. In addition, we will be selectively expanding product categories that we know resonate with our customers, such as the exclusive launch of Wrangler workwear, extensions of our clothing basics (17:55), fall seasonal decor, and our outdoor sporting goods lineup. So to wrap up, we believe we are well positioned to support our customers' needs in the second half of the year with our in-store or online product offerings, complemented with our customer engagement initiatives, all of which are supported by a nimble supply chain. I will now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2018, we had solid comp store sales growth of 5.6%. May and June were the strongest months of the quarter, with May being the highest comp overall. Petsense stores continue to have positive comp store sales increases in line with our expectations. For the second quarter, gross profit dollars increased 9.2% to $769.4 million. Gross margin was relatively steady with a slight decrease of 16 basis points to 34.8%. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in freight expense, which was due to higher carrier rates and increased diesel fuel prices. Our average fuel prices have been running up 20% or more year-over-year. Partially offsetting these items were our effective price management initiatives and a lower level of promotional activity compared to the prior year. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 27 basis points to 22.4%. Higher incentive compensation from the strong year-over-year growth in comparable store sales, along with investments in infrastructure and technology to support our ONETractor strategy, were the primary contributors to SG&A increase. Partially offsetting these increases were leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Normalizing for incentive compensation year-over-year, we had good underlying SG&A performance. In line with our expectations, our effective tax rate decreased to 22.8% in the second quarter. The decrease was driven by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017. Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet and we continue our track record of generating strong cash flows from operations. At quarter end, our merchandise inventories were $1.63 billion, an increase of 3.5% on a per store basis from the 2017 second quarter. The increase was principally due to inflation as well as a growth in fast-turning everyday merchandise to support the positive trends in the business. Our finance inventory improved approximately 500 basis points over the prior year with accounts payable leverage at about 39.8% for the quarter. We believe our inventory's in great shape and we are very comfortable with its quality. As we enter the second half of the year, we're well positioned to take advantage of the change of the seasons. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Year-to-date, through the second quarter, we repurchased about 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $252.6 million and paid quarterly dividends totaling $71.4 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased nearly $2.4 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $617 million as of the quarter end. Let's turn now to our guidance. Given our performance year-to-date, we are raising our financial outlook for 2018. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $7.77 billion to $7.8 billion, an increase of 7% to 7.5% over fiscal 2017. Comparable store sales in the range of 3% to 3.5% and net income in the range of $505 million to $517 million, and earnings per diluted share of $4.10 to $4.20 compared to our previous guidance of $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share. We continue to forecast capital spending in the range of $260 million to $300 million for the year. Also, consistent with our outlook as we came into 2018, in terms of cadence, we continue to believe that comp store sales and earnings performance in the first half of the year will be stronger as compared to the second half. Given the comparisons for 2017, we expect comp sales in the second half of the year to be below the full-year revised guidance range as we have our most challenging compares. Please keep in mind, we're lapping an estimated 120 basis point benefit from hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017. I think it's important to look at our healthy traffic trends as well as comp sales trends on a two-year or even a three-year stack. For the remainder of the year, we expect gross margin rate to be slightly down, principally due to higher transportation-related costs and still expect SG&A deleverage. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy with our first priority being reinvestments back into the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We remain on track to open about 80 new Tractor Supply stores, 20 new Petsense stores and the substantial completion of our new distribution center in Frankfort, New York. We also are committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and continued share repurchases. All in, we are pleased with where we are at this point in the year. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Kurt, and I'd like to express my appreciation to the more than 29,000 team members here at Tractor Supply and Petsense for their commitment to our mission and values as they focus on delivering a great customer experience every day to our Out Here lifestyle customers. We have a strong and growing business which addresses a unique niche operated by an exceptional team of \u2013 team members. And as a team, we are energized about our prospects as we go forward for the remainder of the year. With that, Mary Winn, I'd like to turn it over to you and open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Sounds great. Jenny, if we can start with Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Ben. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: I wanted to ask about the big-ticket strength that you called out. Certainly, it sounds like secularly improving energy and stabilizing ag markets helped to some degree. But I'm curious what role your private label credit card played in this quarter, specifically, and then how you imagine it playing into big-ticket longer term. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Ben, this is Kurt. In regards to your question about private label credit card, I'll give you a couple points on our private label credit card program, which we're excited about. We saw solid growth in the program. For example, couple key points. Year-over-year sales on the program are up and were up in every month. Our tender penetration on the private label credit card also was up in the quarter. Our initial focus on the program right now is deferred financing offers. And we believe that the offers that we put together this year for our customers resonated well. It allowed customers who were looking for deferred financing on bigger tickets to be able to accept that level of program. So, we're excited on private label. We believe it has a great level of potential in the future. But this is a long-term initiative, and we believe that not only is it something that resonates for deferred financing and can be a contributor to big ticket, but we'll be focused in the future as we mature this program to be able to drive more tender to that card, and believe we can find efficiencies in our tender by driving more of our business to the card. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. And then, Greg, if I could ask a quick follow-up about your comments on the tariffs. You said as things stand today on tariffs, you'd expect no impact for FY 2018. Is that also the case for FY 2019 as things stand today on the tariff front? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Ben, I would say that no, that is not the case for 2019. Many of these tariffs will start to have some impact in 2019. As I mentioned, we don't know the full extent yet, although we've run some preliminary numbers. And like I said, we have two options. One option is going out now and looking to resource those products, which we are doing, in some cases, looking at alternative countries and places where we can build product. And then, again, some of this could be a pass on to the consumer. But let me remind you, only about 10% of our overall receipts are directly imported. We do have another percentage that we can't totally qualify yet that would be coming through, I'll call it, indirect, meaning it's components that are put into products that are probably assembled here in the U.S. that we buy from, I'll say, the U.S. maker. Those things are the more difficult ones to get our hands on. But we feel very comfortable through 2018 we're in good shape. In 2019, we'll deal with this as we know more and as we can quantify one of those two positions we need to take. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: That's great color. Thanks, and best of luck. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, everyone, and nice quarter, guys. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: My main question is on \u2013 no problem. My main question is on EBIT margins, which are under some pressure today, and it looks like the guide has them accelerating in the second half. As we know, there's a big inflection expected in 2019. So, can we address what some of the key components of that inflection are and how could we sort of get comfort or confidence in some of those today? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Simeon, this is Kurt. In regards to the operating margin opportunity for us and where we see that going in the future, it's part of our strategy that we manage both, the gross margin and the SG&A factors that play into the operating margin. For the second half of the year, the key factors that we consider in the EBIT margin is that gross profit does have higher transportation pressures this year and going forward. We believe that continues into the second half. And based on our performance and the comparisons to last year, you have a bit of a headwind on the incentive comp. In regards to the transportation, the efforts we have on cost mitigation as well as what our merchants are doing on the pricing side, we have momentum to not only mitigate the cost on the transportation side, but as well as be able to find offsets on pricing. So, we believe there's some headwind on operating margin in the back half as we saw a little bit in Q2, but we're managing and controlling what we can control and focused on the transportation costs and driving efficiencies in there. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And I'll make the related follow-up to 2019, and I realize it's too early to talk about numbers. But is 2019 about investments rolling off or are there certain profit pools that start to increase from some of the efforts that you've been investing in 2018? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Simeon. There's three key factors that I would give to you to remind you on looking-forward ahead, as we expect to be able to steady the operating margin beyond 2018. First, the investments we've been making over the last few years are beginning to plateau. So, the burden that you see on the operating margin is in the run rate. The second thing, those investments are beginning to contribute to the top line, as you indicated. And a good example of that, four quarters now of 3%-plus comp sales. And then, lastly, our efforts on operating efficiencies, which is part of our ONETractor strategy, are focused on offsetting the cost pressures in the industry. So, the combination of those three things are what are core to driving our expectation to steady the operating margin. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'd like to dig into the comp strength in the quarter a little bit. How much would you characterize as a shift in seasonal merchandise from Q1 just with the slower start to spring, and how much would you describe as your omni-channel loyalty initiatives beginning to gain traction? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, this is Steve, Zach. What I would do is I would say that there was a modest impact that we saw when it came to seasonal merchandise, and that was noted in some of the earlier remarks. When you look at the totality of the business, what gets me really excited is that there was strength across the four walls and growth on the digital side as we continue to work toward that seamless shopping experience for our consumer. And so, I'm looking at this and I'm looking at all the initiatives we have within ONETractor, a lot of the technical ones, what we're doing with Neighbor's Club, and how we're working the inside of the store, and they're all playing a role in some of the foundational comps that we've experienced. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And you also mentioned earlier that your customer engagement had been improving. Curious if you could comment on just some of the specific metrics that you track there and then, how your ability to capture customer data has improved and how you are now able to learn more about your customers. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Zach, I'll take the first piece and throw the second piece over to Steve. On the SMG scores, we use this company to track our performance with the consumer. And we have one metric that we use, it's the GURA metric, the greet, uncover, recommend and ask metric. And we can actually measure through customer responses how we're performing on that. And I can tell you when we see higher levels of greeting and higher levels of recommendation, it seems to drive our comp sales. And we saw quite a bit of that improvement as we went into the second quarter of this year. This is something that John Ordus and his team in the field have been working on for the last, I would say, two years or so. And we're seeing very nice improvement in those customer, we'll call it, loyalty or customer response scores. So, we can track this. And by tracking it and understanding where we need to place emphasis, John's team has been able to bring those scores up and we're seeing that in the comp sales. Steve, do you want to take the other piece? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, I would just say when it comes to the Neighbor's Club loyalty program, there's one data point that I think is really meaningful. And that is that the stores that have a higher penetration of sales and transactions of Neighbor's Club members generate higher comp store sales. And I would say that there's a reason for that, and that has to do with our work toward email communication, personalization, and how we're working with the customer on quarterly rewards. I think all that ties together to show the difference between stores that are performing well with a higher penetration versus those that aren't. How we grow it \u2013 and this is what the team's been working on, this thing has scaled dramatically. And I believe Greg said that at the end of the quarter, we had almost 8.7 million members en route to 10 million members. The benefit that we're getting is the loyalty from them and, at the same time, we're getting the benefit of the e-mail communication that we can deliver directly to them, and we can be incredibly nimble. So I guess I feel very good about the direction we're headed and I think there's a lot more work that can be done to even enhance where we're at today. Operator : And moving on, we have a question from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Hi, thanks, nice quarter. Just to follow-up on the Neighborhood Club (sic) [Neighbor's Club] loyalty program, any sense for what you think the ultimate potential could be? I know you cited 10 million by the end of the year, but what do you think that could be over the next couple of years? And then just on the guidance, just to clarify the comp view, did you say that you expected it to be below the 3% to 3.5% or slightly below? Just wanted to clarify for our models. Thanks. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Chuck, I'll start with the question. One of the things that we're really careful about is setting a target that could actually produce maybe poor or bad behavior. And I get the question, Greg does too, a lot of times on exclusive brands and what percentage should it be. One of the things that we believe is that our team members have a connection in the small communities that we're in with our customers. We're a relationship-based business. We're going to continue to ask if our customers would like to be part of the program and then show them the benefits. How it scales from there, we're going to have to see. But what we're not going to do is get in a position where we're going to force some uncomfortable experience there at the point of sale to try to drive the number up. So while we've got some internal targets that are relatively rough that I'd rather not communicate at this point, I would just tell we're working toward continued growth. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: And Chuck, this is Kurt. In regards to the second part of the question, yes, just to clarify, our anticipation on the back half of the year is that we will have positive comp sales in both quarters. But the back half of the year would net below the revised guidance range of 3% to 3.5%. And a point of perspective there is we're running first half 4.7% and we anticipate the full year to be at 3% to 3.5%. And so, we anticipate the back half, because principally the stronger compares we've got in the back half, that those positive comp store sales will be below the 3% to 3.5% range. Operator : And we will hear next from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth? Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Seth? Operator : And one moment. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Can you guys hear me? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes, we can. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Hey. Sorry about that. So a couple follow-ups here. First on the average ticket, very strong, strongest in many years, inflation seemed to accelerate a lot. I think you called out a 75 basis point benefit. As you think about the outlook, I mean, this seems to be tracking higher than what you assumed previously. If I recall you were expecting about neutral for 2018. So, can you just elaborate on what you're seeing and give us a sense of what you're embedding in the guidance now? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Seth, this is Kurt. Just a little bit of point of reference on where we're at. We anticipated to see some modest inflation in 2018 when we set our original guidance. And we saw in first quarter some modest level inflation. We mentioned it was the first time, so 20-plus basis points of inflation first quarter. So, we did see a pickup in the second quarter. And we anticipate in the back half to have some level of inflation, impact in the back half to be generally in line with what we saw in second quarter. 60 basis points to 80 basis points may be a good range to anticipate from what we can see today on the inflation. Lastly, on inflation \u2013 go ahead. Lastly on inflation, most of the inflation we've seen so far principally from the commodities and grain. And we've seen, that has some volatility and can change. We're starting to see lesser extent some inflation in oil and steel-based product as well. But overall, we anticipate at this point about 60 basis points to 80 basis points impact on the back half of the year. Operator : And moving on, we will go to a question from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Steven. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Regarding 2Q gross margin, can you expand on the freight and fuel headwinds you mentioned in the release? And really just as it relates to what you're seeing between \u2013 the cost differential between spot and contractual rates, and how successful you've been, right, if you were to rate yourself and maybe talk about the initiatives, right, internally on limiting your exposure to the spot market as we kind of digest the impact to the back half and into 2019? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: So, why don't we \u2013 Kurt, why don't you take the first portion of that, and then maybe I can talk a little bit to the spot. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. Steven, in regards to the transportation costs, if we \u2013 and I'm just breaking out the gross transportation that we've seen. First, our carrier average rates are higher year-over-year, and I would say they're running greater than our original estimates. And probably in line with what we're seeing on the industry, there's variations, but anywhere from high-single digits to low teen-type increases year-over-year. The fuel costs are slightly above our original expectations to start the year, running about 20% year-over-year increases. We do see spot rate usage increase, and that is playing into the transportation costs. But we are working to manage that. And what we're working on right now and our solutions are a number of key efficiencies in our transportation side of the business to be able to mitigate that. And, Steve, I'll let you mention what we're doing on the transportation side. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, I was just going to mention that the spot buy for Tractor Supply Company is a very small percentage of our overall carrier business. So, it is very low-single digit and continues to get lower. And some of the things that we've done to mitigate that is really open up the window another day or so with our carriers, and that's dropped the spot buy down considerably. So, again, I think going forward, I don't see the spot portion of this being the biggest risk. We're watching diesel prices and just, in general, capacity, probably more importantly. Operator : At this time, we'll hear from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Brian. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Congratulations on a nice quarter. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So I've got two, I guess, bigger picture questions, and I'll merge them into one. But first off, with regard to just the farm economy, a lot of chatter out there related to headlines and some pressures on the farm community, given tariffs and other factors. Have you seen any impact or do you anticipate any impact to Tractor's business from that? And then my second question, Greg, back to your tariff comments earlier. How nimble is Tractor Supply? So it seems like you're saying you don't expect any impact here in 2018, but you're looking to 2019, how quickly can Tractor Supply move sourcing or how quickly could you act to adjust prices in your stores to offset any potential tariffs? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Let me address both of those, Brian. This is Greg. First, the farm economy pressures, as you know, less than 10% of our customer base is truly impacted by production farming. So, it's a small number. I think what the President has done recently with the soybean scenario is going to play out much better. That aid of $12 billion and such will help. But so far, we've really seen no impacts. Again, I think the next several rounds of the tariff conversations, where these settle, could have a little bit more to play as we go into 2019. But for 2018, so far so good is the way I would say it for us here at Tractor Supply. Now, the second piece on tariffs, how nimble are we? How fast can we resource products? Remember, only about 10% is direct from factory to Tractor. There is some other factors involved there with, what I'll call, indirects, where it's products that are being pulled through the supply chain, components that are used to assemble products here and such. And what I can tell you is we're very nimble. We have a very strong presence in the Far East. We are sourcing product now in multiple countries. We have the ability to move products probably faster than anyone else in our channel. But we will still continue to watch this closely to make sure that we don't overcorrect, because some of this is a bit of a Washington pushing the envelope with China, try to get some concessions. And this is really all about intellectual property rights. Let's face it, that's what this big concern is from Washington. So, I'm hopeful that we'll see some concessions on both sides that'll bring this level of intensity down over the next several months. And by the end of the year, maybe this will be somewhat of a non-issue. But we are very nimble. Our supply chain is much more sophisticated today than it was 10 years ago. We have ample places to source product. And we're working with our extended vendor community, those who we buy, I'll call it, domestically from who have ties to China for components and such as well as the things we do on a direct basis. Operator : And at this time, we will hear from Peter Benedict of Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess my question will be around \u2013 hey, Greg \u2013 around the operating efficiencies that Kurt you'd mentioned and, Steve, I think you mentioned some. But just any color \u2013 more color on what you guys think you can accomplish there. You mentioned some things on transportation, but what other areas of the business do you see these operational efficiencies really coming through, which will help you kind of offset the investment headwinds as we look into 2019 and 2020? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, thanks, Peter, this is Kurt. On the operational efficiency, I'll give you a couple key updates on that. First, I'd say for us, when we look at that, this is transformational. It's implementing and introducing productivity and efficiency measurements in the business. And where we're at with that program, we said we were going to do a comprehensive review and initial assessment in the first half of the year, and we're completing the initial assessments now. We are, in the second half, launching the efforts to implement the first initial waves of some change and improvements in the second half. And the big buckets of those areas : first, supply chain, which does have a heavy portion in transportation; store productivity, and indirect procurement. And as I started, I would just say, this is a long-term strategy. It is part of our ONETractor strategy. And this is something that we will be focused on over the next few years. I'd expect savings not to occur until 2019, as we're beginning to make those investments and those changes in the back half of 2018 and into 2019. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Do you think there was a net impact to your traffic in the second quarter from the weather? And, Kurt, I think you made the comment we should look at traffic on a two and three-year stack basis in the third quarter. And if we do that, it would imply that traffic's going to be flat in the third quarter. Is that the right way that we should be modeling traffic for 3Q? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, Michael, I'll take the last one first. That comment I would not \u2013 I'm not try to infer anything particular to a quarter. We're real proud, and there's a strong momentum in the business on comp sales and traffic has been consistent. So, we recognize Q3 has some strong headwinds facing on the comps from last year, but the momentum of the business puts us in a position that we believe we can drive good, positive comp sales in the third quarter. I do believe looking at the overall comps on two-year stack is a good way of looking at it. And if you do, you're seeing 6% or 6%-plus comps not only in some of the past quarters, but going forward in the back half of the year. And then in regards to the first part of your question, which was the weather, weather is a favorable contributor to the second quarter results, not really a key driver. And I'll give you two points of reference to think about with that. First, as Steve mentioned, there's strong trends in the seasonal business that we had in the second quarter and that may indicate benefit from the weather. But then also the core business was strong across the second quarter and across a lot of that everyday merchandise throughout the quarter. So as you balance those out, you really come to the fact that weather was a favorable contributor, but not necessarily that key driver. Operator : And our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel of MoffettNathanson. Oliver Wintermantel - MoffettNathanson LLC : Yeah. Good morning, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Oliver. Oliver Wintermantel - MoffettNathanson LLC : Good morning. I had a question regarding your online sales. You said they were up double digits. If you could maybe help us over the last few quarters what the trend was there, maybe in percentage points, and then also what the percent of total online sales of your total business is right now. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. This is Steve. We talk a lot about continued growth and momentum in that channel. What I can tell you is, as Greg mentioned, it's continued to be strong double-digit growth. And as we look forward to the remainder of the year, it will likely be between 2% and 3% of our total business as a company and that continues to scale pretty dramatically. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, and nice results, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Peter. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I'm curious on the way that the guidance was raised, certainly great to see and a great first half of the year, seems like there's pretty good kind of steady momentum in the business. Greg, you talked about some tailwinds to the spending environment. What's been the change to the back half, if any? Do you guys see more opportunity or just kind of sticking with original plan and seeing how the quarters unfold? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Peter, this is Kurt. There's a few variables that play into the revised guidance, and I'll mention a few of those. First, I mean, the momentum we see on the top line and the strength of the core business is a key factor for the increase in the top-line sales. When you look at the rest of the P&L, the two other key factors is we've seen with pressures in the transportation costs that there will be a higher pressure on that and slightly lower gross margin rate as well as the performance of the business, particularly the top line, drives higher incentive compensation. And you're looking at 2018 at a more normalized or slightly higher incentive comp versus the compares of last year. So, those are two key points that play into the back half in regards to the bottom line on the revised guidance. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: And one comment I would make is on the top line it's really more of a factor of the really solid performance that we had in the second half of last year and comping up against that. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will hear next from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. So two questions. So first is, can you talk about the performance of the stores in the oil markets? I think in the back half of the last year you started to see those get back in line. And I think the past two quarters, it has slightly outperformed the chain average. Has that accelerated? And my follow-up question is, as you think about last year, July you saw nice inflection, you had an extended seasonal period partly driven by favorable weather. So, the quarter seemed sort of bookended by July and September with the hurricanes there. How are you thinking about the extended seasonal business here in the third quarter and how that might play out from a weather perspective? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Christopher, this is Kurt, I'll start with the questions and hit the oil markets. When it comes to geographic, I'll back up and just say one of the things we were excited about the second quarter is all geographies positive comp and the range was pretty tight. But in regards to the oil markets, as you mentioned, Texas, Oklahoma area was the strongest geographic region that we had during second quarter. And so in comparison, where you saw some headwinds causing there to be a little bit of a pressure in that area, I would say that it helped this year being slight \u2013 part of the benefit and contributor to Texas, Oklahoma's performance on the business. And then Steve, you can take the next question. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. In terms of the extended seasonal sales, we have baked in what we believe is the current run rate into the forecast for the back half of the year, so that's solidly in there for you. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to a question from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, I'll squeeze two quick follow-ups into some topics that have already been touched upon. The first is whether with the strength in the top line you've amended the pace of investments in the second half relative to what you had initially expected? And then somewhat relatedly, if you could just remind us of the benchmarks that drive your incentive comp, is it purely top-line driven or is there a profit component to that as well. Thanks so much. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Matt, this is Kurt. I'll address those, but let me first just ask for clarification. You had said baked into the guidance was a slowdown in the investments. Did I hear you correct? Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, I guess what I asked was whether you had changed \u2013 presumably, raised \u2013 the pace of investments, or changed them one way or the other, in the second half of the year given the strong start that you had to the first half and the stronger pace of sales... Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Okay. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...that you've seen year-to-date. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. No, we've not really had any meaningful shift in the level of investments, either the capital spend or any operational investments on the back half of the year based on the first half. We're sticking with our plan and we're executing it well. And the SG&A spend is pretty much consistent with what our plan was. In regards to the incentive comp, our team members in the field are incentivized on a monthly store sales bonus. So, you'll see in strong performance on the top line, all of our team members are eligible for store sales bonus monthly. And we're real excited to be able to pay our store managers and our team members out in the store a sales bonus when they have a performance like Q2. And when you compare, as I mentioned earlier, first half of last year on incentive comp, first half was a 0.2% comp sales and this year was a 4.7%. So, you can see how incentive comp plays in. Both store managers and then management within the company is incentivized on a profit bonus, bottom line, return driven compared to our plan that we pay out against target for the year. And so, those are the two key contributors on the incentive comp. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Operator : And we'll hear next from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot and good morning. My question's around big ticket. If you could give us more color on how big-ticket comps trended for the quarter and how much of that was being driven by \u2013 whether it be seasonal factors with the weather, your more compelling financing offers, or other factors, that would be great. Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. So, Seth, this is Steve. As mentioned, it was really driven by product mix. It was driven by slight or moderate inflation, like we talked about. And then, of course, the big ticket. In big ticket, there was a variety of categories that were impacted. So, it wasn't relegated to just one specific area. The one area that I would point to is riders and mowers, and a lot of it had to do with the new and expanded lineup, along with some seasonal benefit. The card was used for a number of those categories, but I would just caution us as we look forward that every quarter is very unique and very different at Tractor Supply Company. And the first half and the back half is very different. So while the vast majority of our business was benefited in big ticket by riders and mowers, that doesn't necessarily translate into the back half of this year. So overall, we were pleased with the big ticket. We think that our assortments were laid out well for that customer to come in and get it, and we certainly benefited from it. Operator : And our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everyone. Good quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Chuck. Thank you, Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : The one thing I noted in the press release was a decrease in promotional activity. Could you talk about that a little bit? Was it perhaps affected by strong demand and less markdowns, strong traffic as part of that? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Chuck, this is Steve. We got off \u2013 throughout the quarter one of the things we talk a lot about is being nimble. And I would say there's probably not a better example of that than our ability to go in and take a look at our promotional cadence and make adjustments where we need to, to refine the business. As we got through the second quarter and sales were pretty solid, we were able to pull back and do some things there. And I think that overall it benefited the business and the overall margin rates. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Jenny, we've hit the top of the hour. So, I think that wraps up our call. I want to say thank you to all of us for joining us today. We look forward to you joining us on our next quarterly call in October. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions and thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you all. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Bye. Operator : And again, that does conclude our call. We would like to thank everyone for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Tractor Supply undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one related follow-up question, if necessary. I appreciate your cooperation. We will be available for the call for follow-up. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. To begin this morning, I want to thank all of the Tractor Supply and Petsense team members for their tremendous efforts during the recent hurricane season as they went the country mile for many of our customers. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of our team members and the communities who have been directly impacted by the recent hurricanes. Now, to the business results, we are delighted with our strong third quarter performance, driven by overall robust sales growth. Once again, our results were driven by broad-based strength across all geographic regions as well as increases in both comparable average ticket and traffic, and all merchandising divisions achieved positive comp sales in the quarter. Our third quarter results represent the fifth consecutive quarter of comp store sales above 3% as we cycled our most difficult quarterly comparison of a year ago. During the quarter the Tractor Supply team executed well across many of our areas; store operations, merchandising, supply chain and planning and placement. While the overall retail economy is doing well, our teams did a great job of developing plans that resonated with our customers that were seasonally relevant and continue to drive transactions and our average ticket. We continue to be in stock for our customers with our everyday basic assortments that we know our customers depend on from Tractor Supply, that help them live their Out Here lifestyle. As I shared with you last quarter, I believe the macro backdrop for our consumers is relatively healthy given the recent trends in unemployment and consumer confidence. For Tractor Supply, the macro headwinds we've experienced over the last several years have abated and the team is now in a position to capitalize on the current consumer trends. We continue to see some benefit from energy-related markets, along with inflationary trends, both of which are positively contributing to our top-line performance. Given our performance to the third quarter, we are raising our full year outlook given the ongoing strength in our business. We believe our merchandising, marketing efforts along with our ONETractor strategy initiatives have well positioned us for years to come. Let us touch on a few highlights for the third quarter as compared to third quarter last year. Net sales increased 9.3% to $1.8 billion for the quarter as we stayed the course on our strategy to open new stores at both Tractor Supply and Petsense. Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the third quarter with comp average ticket increasing 3.6% and transactions growing at plus 1.4% in the quarter. This quarter marks 41 out of 42 quarters that our customer traffic count has been positive. Consistent with the second quarter of this year, the average ticket increase continued to be among the best we have had in the last six years. Diluted EPS was $0.95, an increase of nearly 32%. Year-to-date, we have returned $398 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. And based on our performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.23 to $4.27, up from our previous guidance of $4.10 to $4.20. Now, let's take a look at several of the operational highlights for the quarter. We opened 23 new Tractor Supply stores and 7 Petsense locations. Our overall customer satisfaction scores continued to be at record levels. Based on our recently completed team member engagement survey, our scores continue to be very, very strong. We continue to see growth in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program, now with over 9.7 (sic) [9.7 million] members as we are well on track to exceed our goal of 10 million Neighbor's Club members by the end of this year. This quarter marks our 25th consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth in our e-commerce business. And during the third quarter, we continued to experience exceptional growth with Buy Online Pick Up in Store again exceeding our expectations. This tool encourages customers to come into the store to pick up online orders, and this is resulting in 20% of our customers making an incremental purchase. Between the combination of Buy Online Pick Up in Store and direct delivery to the stores, more than 70% of our e-commerce orders continue to be fulfilled at a store level, illustrating the importance of our store assets and their key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. Importantly, this is a very cost-effective way to serve our customers with greater speed, convenience and efficiency. We believe that with our capabilities of Buy Online Pick Up in Store, mobile point-of-sale, Neighbor's Club and Stockyard in-store kiosk, we are uniquely positioned to serve this customer base better than anyone in this fragmented market. And we see significant opportunities to broaden our consumer reach and increase our markets share as our store base and digital capabilities expand over time. Our ONETractor strategy remains focused on the same four objectives : driving profitable growth, building customer-centric engagement, offering the most relevant products and services, and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We are building solid momentum behind our ONETractor strategy to serve our customers anytime, anywhere and anyway they choose. I believe our ONETractor strategy positions us well to meet the unique preferences our customers have for demand-driven immediate-need products in an easy and seamless shopping experience. We also believe that the continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and the updates to our in-store and online shopping experience are attractive, defensible and are resonating with our customers. We believe these will drive our performance in the coming years. For 2018, we are on track to open 80 new tractor stores and 20 new Petsense store locations, and we continue to be pleased with our new store productivity and returns. Now before I turn the call over to Steve, there's one topic we continue to monitor very closely and that is the tariffs on products from China and their impact on our business. Please keep in mind, we have a large segment of our business, such as our consumable, usable and edible products that would be impacted very little to none at all. Depending on the product category, the team is working through our plans to mitigate the potential impact of tariffs. We will continue to watch this topic closely as there are many moving parts and it is a fluid process. Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter results that exceeded our expectations. Our comp sales were broad based and all four walls of the box performed well for the quarter. Our comp sales growth was driven by both average ticket as well as continued increases in customer traffic. The team did a great job developing and delivering on our merchandising plans and marketing events during the quarter. That, coupled with strong execution by our store teams and across the supply chain network, we successfully cycled the most challenging comparison of the year with a two-year stack of 12%. Many of the performance factors that we experienced in the second quarter continue to benefit us in the third quarter. Our strong average ticket growth of 3.6% was driven by strength in our items per transaction, product mix, inflation and, to a lesser extent, growth in big-ticket categories. The store operations and merchandising teams put forth a coordinated effort to grow our average ticket, and we saw that pay off in the quarter. In addition, commodity inflation across categories, such as livestock feed, pet food, steel and oil-based products contributed approximately 90 basis points to our average ticket performance. Lastly, our average ticket improvement experienced some benefit from big-ticket sales. We did experience strength in big-ticket sales across several product lines, which included a go-long (12:36) replenishment strategy around outdoor power equipment. Our supply chain remained nimble throughout the quarter, and we took advantage of the favorable weather trends. We continue to be pleased with our traffic trends, with growth of 1.4% on top of last year's growth of 5%. Please keep in mind that last year we benefited from two major hurricanes. During the quarter, we had strong sales dollars and unit growth of C.U.E. products. Our mission is to be a dependable supplier of basic maintenance products so that our customers can rely on us on a regular basis. Within the C.U.E. products, strength was broad-based across several key product lines, such as pet food and supplies, small animal products, livestock feed, forage and bird feeding, just to name a few. Our pet food business continues to drive solid comp sales. Our exclusive brand of 4health pet food is a differentiator with our customers who value premium quality at a great price. The 4health brand continues to gain share and has become a meaningful part of our overall pet food portfolio. Lastly, traffic benefited from an extended selling season in our spring and summer categories during the quarter. Now, let me turn to the progress we're making on building out our capabilities in support of our customer. We are pleased with the traction we are gaining and our customers response to these initiatives. Specific examples include capabilities such as expanding the functionality of our website, increasing the store count of our Stockyard kiosks and mobile solutions for our team members, growing our Neighbor's Club engagement, enhancing our private label credit card offering and investing in our supply chain. As part of our ONETractor strategy, we continue to enhance the functionality of our website and mobile platform with features to support our seamless shopping experience. For example, we continue to introduce more payment options online. The functionality we added in July to our website to allow our customers the ability to register for and make tax-exempt purchases has exceeded our expectations. In addition, online applications for our private label credit card are up strong double digits, accounting for just under half of our total credit applications. This card is also being used by our customers on our website, as our private label credit card tender online more than doubled in the third quarter. The ongoing expansion of our Stockyard kiosk in select stores will allow us to provide even more customers with a long-tail of product assortment. We now have more than 100,000 SKUs on our website compared to the 15,000 to 20,000 in our stores. At the store level, the Stockyard kiosks are a proven tool for driving incremental sales. By the end of the year, we anticipate a third of the chain will have the Stockyard kiosks. The mobile point-of-sale capability will be in approximately 20% to 25% of our chain. We know that when we equip our team members with mobility tools, we see better levels of suggested selling, along with higher customer satisfaction scores. Our Neighbor's Club membership continues to be very strong. We are on track to exceed our goal of 10 million members by the end of the year. This program has quickly become a transformational and growing asset to drive brand loyalty. With a one-year retention rate at nearly 90%, our customer feedback continues to be overwhelmingly positive and key engagement metrics for the third quarter improved sequentially. Our sales per customer are up in the year post enrollment, with Neighbor's Club members shopping between three and four times our average customer. As mentioned last quarter, we are continuing to identify customer insights based on the rich data that we are getting from our loyalty program. The data allows us to target specific customers based on their frequency and category-specific needs. This personalized approach will allow us to drive engagement and share of wallet over time. Being a relationship-based retail company, we continue to test the impact of personalized communications through our digital channels. For example, we just concluded a digital campaign test directed at dog-owning customers with multiple e-mail messages. The messages were personalized across different customer profiles. Initial results have been positive, delivering an increased engagement with these dog owners and providing great insights on customer response. This test will also allow us to continue to build out and refine our model to improve customer engagement across a variety of customer segments. In addition to our Neighbor's Club program, our enhanced private label credit card offerings have resonated with our customers. While still very early, we have seen the use of private-branded credit card increase across the board as a result of more compelling financing offers. Credit card applications are up and the percentage of sales on the card has increased every period since our new offers went into effect in March of this year. Over time, we anticipate that this will become a key tool to deepen our relationship with our customers, drive loyalty and increase our share of wallet. And lastly, we continue to make investments across the supply chain. During the quarter, we opened a new mixing center in Georgia. This is our fourth mixing center, helping us provide just-in-time replenishment of fast-turning C.U.E. and high-C.U.E. products to our stores. We believe this model has further expansion potential, allowing us to better serve our stores and alleviate some capacity constraints across our distribution centers. Our distribution center in Frankfort, New York is on track to begin receiving late in the fourth quarter and begin shipping to our stores in the first quarter of 2019. The Frankfort facility will support replenishment to our stores and increase our fulfillment speed for direct-to-customer orders. As we wrap up the year, the winter season and changing temperatures are rapidly approaching. We are ready for our customers with a strong assortment of apparel, heating and seasonal items, offering innovative products and great value that help our customers live life on their terms. In addition, we have sourced a solid lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday and holiday events, both online and in-store. I believe we're on a great track for a strong finish to the year. And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2018, we had strong comp store sales growth of 5.1%. All three months of the quarter were positive. Petsense stores continue to have positive comp store sales increases, in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, gross profit increased 8.8% to $653.1 million. Gross margin had a slight decrease of 16 basis points to 34.7%. The team was very effective with their efforts to mitigate the impact of overall freight cost increases through our price management initiatives. The pressure we have experienced on our freight expense is not unique to Tractor Supply, given the industry trends of higher carrier rates and increased diesel fuel prices. Average fuel prices have been running up 20% or more year-over-year. All in, the team did a great job navigating the current environment. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 31 basis points to 26.6%. Higher incentive compensation from the strong year-over-year growth in comparable store sales, along with planned investments in infrastructure, labor wages and technology were the primary contributors to the SG&A increase. Partially offsetting these increases were leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Normalizing for incentive compensation year-over-year, we continue to have good underlying SG&A performance. Our effective tax rate decreased to 21.5% in the third quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017. To a lesser extent, an incremental tax benefit associated with higher stock option exercises year-over-year also decreased our effective tax rate. Now, to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet and we continue our track record of generating strong cash flows from operations. At quarter end, our merchandising inventories were $1.7 billion, an increase of about 4% on a per store basis from the 2017 third quarter. The increase is principally due to inflation as well as growth in fast-turning everyday merchandise to support the positive trends in the business. Our financed inventory improved more than 100 basis points over the prior year, with accounts payable leverage at about 39.4% for the quarter. We believe our inventory is in great shape. We are very comfortable with its quality. As we enter the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to take advantage of the change of the seasons. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We are managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 2 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Over the last several years, we have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to have the majority of our debt at fixed rates. About 70% of our long-term debt is fixed, with a weighted average interest rate of about 2.7%. In addition, we're very comfortable with our debt maturation ladder. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we repurchased about 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $289.2 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $109.2 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased over $2.4 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $580 million as of the quarter end. Let's turn now to our guidance. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our financial outlook for 2018. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $7.84 billion to $7.87 billion, an increase of 8% to 8.5% over fiscal 2017. Comparable store sales in the range of 4% to 4.5%, net income in the range of $522 million to $528 million, and earnings per diluted share of $4.23 to $4.27 compared to our previous guidance of $4.10 to $4.20 per diluted share. We now forecast capital spending in the range of $260 million to $280 million for the year. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of approximately 22.3% to 22.5%. As we shared with you earlier in the year, for the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin rate to be down to a greater degree than we have experienced year-to-date and expect SG&A deleverage to be at a modestly lower level. This is mainly a function of the comparisons for the quarter as we are cycling a 50 basis point improvement in gross margin rate and a 120 basis point deleverage in SG&A. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy with our first priority being reinvestments back into the business to support the long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We remain on track to open about 80 new Tractor Supply stores, 20 new Petsense stores and the substantial completion of our new distribution center in Frankfort, New York. We also are committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and continued share repurchases. Over the last three years we have made investments in our ONETractor strategy, complemented with investments across our supply chain that have been required to maintain our leading position in the farm and ranch sector, and capitalize on the digitalization of retail. At the same time, we have increased labor hours and wage rates at both stores and distribution centers. For 2018, we have been disciplined to invest in the key strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our long-term performance. In the current operating environment, there are many variables that are impacting our business that are fluid and constantly changing. Based on what we know today, we continue to anticipate that our investments have plateaued and believe that 2018 is positioned to be the trough in our operating margin rate. We will provide more details on our 2019 outlook when we have our year-end earnings conference call. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Kurt. And I'll reiterate again we believe we really had a strong third quarter. We're on track for a very solid year-end. We have a unique and differentiated model that positions us well for the future. I again want to thank the more than 29,000 team members across the company that allowed us to deliver a great quarter, and I appreciate their hard work. And I know that they are providing legendary customer service every day to our out there \u2013 and Out Here lifestyle customers. With that, Mary Winn, we would like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Great. Thank you. David, we'll move to our first question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you so much, and good morning, everybody. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Matt Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Morning. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: My primary question relates to the sizing of incentive compensation. How significant of a driver of the bump this was in Q3? And if you could just remind us what role that plays in the Q4 expense outlook year-on-year? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Matt, this is Kurt. In regards to incentive compensation, the important thing is that for the third quarter, in particular, it's really about a comparison to prior year, and the comparison is meaningful. The past two years performance was below plan, driving normal \u2013 below-normal incentive compensation expense. And the current year, as you know, and the quarter performance was strong and more normalized. So, we're excited about the strong performance. That does drive incentive compensation, and the incentive compensation was a significant part of the SG&A deleverage. That incentive compensation for the third quarter itself was approximately 40 basis point year-over-year comparison. And with that, you can see, we had strong SG&A deleverage in the third quarter, ex-incentive compensation. For the fourth quarter, the only variable difference, as we called out last year in the fourth quarter, with the performance, we had strong SG&A performance there. So, the compares are not as significant in Q4 as it is in Q3. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And I guess the follow-up would be, since you said that the delta is, frankly, more about what happened last year than what happened this year, would you say that your incentive \u2013 as we think about next year really, would you say that your incentive comp levels in Q3 were sort of in line with what they would be in an average year or were they slightly elevated given the outstanding operating performance? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Matt, we had good solid performance. We're excited about the ability to incentivize our team members with that performance. It's normalized to slightly higher the normalized performance in Q3. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you for the clarity. I appreciate it. Operator : And next, we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Good quarter, guys. I had a question, sort of... Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Welcome. Following up on 2019, and I respect it doesn't sound like we're going to get a lot, but sort of pick your brain on one idea of it. So if comps next year continue their strength, let's say they're 4% or better, do you spend into that or do you allow your margin to float up a little more or quicker than you planned within the context of the 9% to 9.4% (29:56) that you outlined at last year's meeting? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Simeon, this is Kurt. I won't go into 2019 specifics beyond what we've given to you. What our strategy is, is we're going to continue the plan of executing on ONETractor, investing in our stores. And we're going to put a plan together that is consistent. And if we drive comp sales higher than our stated near-term targets of 3% plus, then that drops to additional leverage and operating margin. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And my follow-up is on inflation and tariffs, which Greg mentioned. So, you've had a little bit of inflation in the last couple of quarters, albeit it was following some deflation. Is there any hint about the elasticity, specifically, looking at unit demand? Is there any change that you can either get a glimpse of either what more inflation does or maybe what some of the tariff could do to elasticity? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Simeon, this is Steve. What I can tell you is, is that we're very well positioned here, I believe, a couple of things. First and foremost, Greg mentioned that if you look at the overall model itself, our C.U.E. business over time has really benefited us. And I would also say, and more specific to your question, we tend to be a needs-based retailer. You've heard us talk in the past about our pricing tools that we've invested in. And those pricing tools will help us, as we move forward, test elasticity across the country in the zones that we manage. So, I think we're well-positioned there. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : And next, we'll go to Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good Morning, Steve. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : I wanted to start with Neighbor's Club, right? So, I think you mentioned for the second quarter in a row here the shopping trends, right, three to four times more than the average customer. But any insight into spending habits, average basket size, category penetration? Really just any additional color you could provide on the Neighbor's Club member. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, Steve, this is Steve Barbarick. Glad to do it. Just to start with, Greg mentioned that we've got about 10 million members or will have by the end of the year. And these are some of our most important members. And we can tell not only because of how often they're shopping in terms of frequency, but also what they spend. They tend to spend about 10% more on any given visit than a regular customer would. And because they shop more often, our ability to communicate and personalize those communications to them, based on what they're actually buying, that allows us to upsell, cross sell and even convert them into our exclusive brands, is really a great value to us. So, we're still pulling apart a lot of the data. It's incredibly rich right now. And now, it's about the quality and how we're using it. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And then, just maybe a follow-up on the other strategic initiatives you talked about, Stockyard and mobile kiosks. Right? I think you mentioned about a third of the chain will have the Stockyard, and 20% to 25% will have mobile POS. What's the plan today as you think about the rest of the chain for both those initiatives? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Well, first off, we're seeing some great signs from both. And it's been a methodical rollout. As you know, we talk about being a test-and-learn company. We learned a lot as we've implemented both of these two devices into our stores. As we move forward, we believe that we'll continue to populate our store count with both devices themselves. We've laid out the plan. And you will see us rapidly expand both the kiosks as well as mobile point-of-sale as we get into 2019. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks, Steve. Take care. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And as a quick reminder, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one related follow-up. Next, we'll go to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Chris. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about sort of the hurricane comparison year-over-year? How you think about sort of how much of that headwind was, on a net basis, considering what rolled through this year, obviously, less geographic exposure? And then, also on the seasonal side, you had the extended seasonal period last year that seemed to replay this year. And seems like you're really ready for that on the OPE side. So, can you talk about how, perhaps, the seasonal benefit was compared to last year as well? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Chris, this is Kurt. I'll start with the first question on hurricane, and I'll pass the second part of that over to Steve. The hurricanes, as you recall and was stated earlier, that we had Hurricane Florence this year, but cycling up against two hurricanes last year. Hurricane Florence had a modest benefit to the top line, drove approximately about 40 basis points of benefit on the top line. But that's cycling those two hurricanes last year that we called out at about 120 basis point. So while we were able to capture sales and Florence was part of our benefit on the top line this year, when we look at all the compares in Q3, the actual emergency response was about a 80 basis points drag in comparison to Q3 of last year. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: And I'll take the second question here on the extended selling season. I don't know how much of it was the season and how much of it was some of the work that we did that actually extended that season itself. I will tell you our supply chain team looked at what we did last year. And as we become more national in scale, we're seeing a little more benefit maybe from the southern stores and the length of season that they've had. So when you look at the total comp of the 5.1% that we ran for the quarter, it wasn't a material impact, just because it's a smaller portion of our total business as we move into the quarter. But we certainly were able to comp that extended selling season from a year ago. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. And then, as a related follow-up, as you look at the fourth quarter, you didn't raise the comp outlook, it looks like, and implied about a 2% handle comp. Your comparisons get a lot easier. You don't have the hurricane comparison, the seasonal comparison. And clearly, it's been cold in October here. So, can you talk about your thoughts around the fourth quarter and, perhaps, not taking it up? And how you're feeling about the season so far? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Chris. This is Kurt. Here's how I look at it. First, you can see from our raised guidance, that there is strong momentum in the business. We are going up against a solid 4% plus comp last year in fourth quarter. And with that said, there's a lot of meaningful portion of the quarter still ahead of us, and we're going up against December, which had a real strong benefit from the cold snap. And as a reminder, December is a real strong portion of the quarter. So to give clarification, the start of the quarter has been considered and factored into our guidance. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : And next, we'll go to Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Greg, you spoke talk about your thoughts on the tariffs in general terms. But can you quantify the percentage of your sales that you import from China? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Michael, we can quantify what we bring in on direct basis. We said for a long time, about 10% of our overall mix of products comes from outside the country. A high percentage of that mix comes from China. But the part that is difficult to quantify, and we're now starting to see the impacts of it, is the indirect things, the componentry parts that are going into U.S.-make products or U.S.-assembled products. And the team has done a great job of quantifying and putting together a plan not only to deal with what we've got coming on a direct basis, but what we're seeing as, I'll call it, artificial inflation, okay, on the products that are being tariffed, that are componentry driven that driving costs up in some of the categories. So yes, we understand it. We've got our hands around it. We've got a great plan behind it and we'll execute to that. Michael Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And is your expectation that you'll be able to pass along most of the pressure that you're going to see both directly and indirectly through price increases? And Kurt, when you talk about this year being a trough in the operating margin, does that assume that the 25% tariff does not go through? Would that cause incremental pressure on your operating margin next year? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: I'll start and let Steve and Kurt come in here. We baked into the plans the expectation that tariffs are going to move to 25%. I'll also tell you that you just can't artificially raise price. There will be some consumer, we think, pushback potentially in some categories. So, we're working diligently with our manufacturing base to look for cost reductions from them. We've also bought some push from goods in forward to get ahead of some of that tariff impact. And then there will be a combination of some price increases in certain categories. It's just going to be unavoidable. But we are going to do all we can to keep the impact to our customer at a minimum. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: One other thing I would mention on that, Michael, this is Steve, is that unlike a lot of other retailers out there, we are well positioned being a needs-based organization. When you need fencing to contain an animal, you're going to buy fencing. There's really not many other ways around it. So when you look at our model, our box and our product type, we are less discretionary than many others, and I think that really bodes well for us. The second factor is our purchasing power. We are well positioned in our space to push back and to mitigate a lot of those costs coming through. And the last thing I would tell you is, is not everyone uses the same pricing tools that we've got. And so, we're able to really manage elasticity, probably as well as anyone in our space. Michael Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Andrew Minora - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you? It's Andrew Minora on for Chuck. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Hey, Chuck (sic) [Andrew] (40:57). Andrew Minora - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : I was wondering, first, if you can give us a little bit more detail on the cadence in the quarter. I know you said all three months were positive, but if you can give us any sense of how that trended throughout the quarter. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Chuck (sic) [Andrew] (41:10). This is Kurt. All three months were strong. The cadence was pretty tight and what we expected to see was September had the toughest compares going up against a couple hurricanes. And so where we saw any variation may have been in September where there was the toughest compare. But very excited about how it started out and how we were able to compare that toughest month of September against the hurricanes. Andrew Minora - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then one quick follow-up. I know you guys talked about carrier rates in the quarter. Would you be able to quantify the increase year-over-year in the carrier rates? And if you can, like what's your expectation for these in the fourth quarter and then 2019, to get worse, stay the same? Just any color around that would be helpful. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Chuck (sic) [Andrew] (41:58). This is Kurt. As been mentioned, is part of the industry average and well documented, and we're seeing similar things. While the fuel prices are up year-over-year, similar like they were in the second quarter, about 20% plus on fuel costs, the carrier rates have been averaging year-over-year in the teens. And we saw that in second quarter, again in third quarter. We believe we'll see persistence on that into the fourth quarter. And then just looking ahead, while we believe transportation cost pressures do continue, when you see where it began to really increase in the beginning of 2018, the compares a little bit easier. So, we believe the year-over-year impact starts to moderate. The key is what we're doing to take action on that and the efforts that Tractor Supply have in regards to mitigating any cost increases on that. And we're doing a few things right now, today, and laying the foundation that we believe really help with the impact in 2019. And we're managing with our vendors and our carriers the ordering time frames to avoid spot rates. That's been effective as we've seen our usage of spot go down compared to some of the peaks in the first half of the year. And we're leveraging our strategic sourcing group to reduce stem miles. And part of our profit improvement initiative that we mentioned for this year to lay the foundation, we're addressing also the utilization of trucks to a greater level and working on our carrier rates. There's some great momentum on that. We believe that will help us going into 2019. Andrew Minora - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : That's really helpful. Thanks a lot. Have a great day, guys. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Chuck (sic) [Andrew] (43:50). Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth L. Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, guys. Is there any color you can give on the performance of Petsense stores year-to-date? I know you mentioned that comps are positive and that you added seven new stores in the quarter. But any other details you can provide about the performance of those stores? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Liz, this is Greg. Here's what I'll tell you about Petsense. We're pleased with our overall performance. It was very positive. We'll have 180 stores by year-end. As you know, we're going through a lot of back house integration right now that won't be complete until about the mid of 2019, and that's giving them the capability to manage and operate their business very similarly to the way we do here at Tractor Supply. As you probably recall, they were a private company that was run a little more entrepreneurial and we've kind of brought them into the way of thinking about how if they're going to someday be a 500 to \u2013 800 to 1,000 store chain, they needed to have the capabilities of Tractor Supply, and as a back house for them. So, we're very pleased with how that integration is going. We're also testing several new store formats within Petsense. New color pallet, new d\u00e9cor, new layouts. And so far the few that we've got up, we're very pleased with those performances. We're also doing some other things within the mix of product. The differentiation of product's important. Just as Steve mentioned about what we've done within the categories of Tractor, we had the same opportunities in Petsense. And we launched True Source about a year ago. True Source is becoming a major force inside the Petsense brand. And then what our belief is, this is still going to be a growth vehicle for us as a company in both that rural and next (45:43) suburban community over the next five to seven years. But very pleased with the performance, and more to be shared as we get a larger store base out there. Elizabeth L. Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And is the e-commerce division there growing kind of at a similar pace to the Tractor Supply e-commerce? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: It is not. It is a very simple, straightforward format. We have not converted over to the Tractor platform just yet. That will be in 2019. We're today using a third-party format through the disturber, one of our major distributors, but that also will be an opportunity going forward. But to be very honest, there hasn't been a tremendous amount of e-commerce business being generated from the Petsense locations. It's a very convenient one-stop shop. It's a high-service location. So, the food side of it could accelerate once we get the new platform in place, but I think it's more of a store where people like to visit. They come there with their pets, grooming is a big component and adoption and so on. So, it's a little bit different format than just selling product online. This is really more an experience store, just like Tractor. Elizabeth L. Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : And next, we'll go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I was wondering if you might be able to \u2013 hi. I was wondering if you might be able to dig in a little bit more on the increase in average ticket the you guys had. Specifically, can you quantify what the impact has been from your deferred financing program on average ticket? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure, Scot. This is Kurt. What I can tell you is that our big ticket was a contributor to the average ticket increase. We're very pleased with the performance on big ticket. Big ticket was slightly above chain average growth and it drove about 40 basis points of the overall comp ticket growth. And we do see a good correlation between the customers' acceptance and use of the new extended financing on big-ticket items. So trying to be able to exactly connect on average ticket and big-ticket to the new credit card is difficult, but we can say that we're pleased with the results and there's a strong correlation to growth in big ticket as well as growth in the private-label credit card program. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess kind of related to that, what has been \u2013 I mean, the first thing you cited in terms of average ticket was number of items in the basket. Just kind of generically kind of what are the top two or three items that you're doing to drive the items in the basket? Because obviously, there has been a pretty big inflection in the average ticket performance in the last two quarters. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Scot, this is Steve. Here's what I would tell you. There has been a concerted effort here to work on average ticket. Our store teams have put together some contests, and it's all about add-on selling. It's interesting, when you hire your customer, you're not hiring professional salespeople. You're hiring people just like yourself, quite frankly, that are customers. And by giving them confidence that they can recommend products to customers, that goes a long way. And so we're seeing, from a store operations side, some benefit in adding more to the basket. And another thing we implemented on the technology side, we haven't talked much about this, is multiples. We're now able to enforce multiple purchasing. And during the quarter in our Center Court Events, we had a Buy More and Save event. And it's where you come in and you buy 3-for or 4-for (49:32). And now that we're able to enforce that, we're finding that people are taking full advantage of that opportunity. And between that and some other things that we're doing internally, we're really seeing the items per transaction move up. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Very helpful. Thanks, guys Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Appreciate all the... Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ...incremental color on the Neighbor's Club. But is there any way to isolate what the impact of the program has contributed to comps in the quarter and year? And at this point with nearly 10 million members, what percent of your sales would you say are being derived from Club members today versus the potential ahead? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Well, this is Steve. And we've done some work. First off, the whole collection of all the efforts we're putting forth, whether it be the investments we've made, the initiatives, some of the things I just talked to Scot about, they all add up to the 5.1% comp. And we're not really breaking and isolating all those apart. I will tell you that we do see continued momentum in the Neighbor's Club program. It's still in the very early stages of what the opportunity is in front of us, to be quite frank with you. And we haven't quantified the specifics relative to the actual incrementality of all the communication that we've been sending out. We are seeing more per visit with these customers. We are seeing more frequency from these customers. So, we know that there is a benefit there. And then, the second portion of your question had to do with the percent of sales. What I can tell you, that percent is growing. We have not communicated what that looks like publicly at this point as it continues to scale. But with 10 million members, you can imagine, it's probably a pretty good percentage of our business. And I suspect in the future, we'll have more dialogue around what that might look like. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And just quickly on your online orders, any callouts in terms of basket size or customer frequency compared to in-store orders? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Sure. This is Steve again. I will tell you our online orders are typically significantly higher than any given transaction that takes place in our store. Greg mentioned earlier that about 70% to 75% of those orders are picked up in-store and with about a 20% attachment rate. So, we see a real benefit of giving that customer an opportunity from a convenience standpoint to go online, buy, pick up in store, have shipped to store, or ship to home. Just a couple of other quick things I would note on that. We're really excited about the fact that our web visits are up about 30% year-over-year. Unique visits are up double digits. And our store locator \u2013 and this is the one that I always go back to and why it's so critically important to have the website that we have, and the traffic. Our store locator hits were up 50% year-over-year. And what that tells me is there's a lot of customers who may have never gone to a Tractor Supply Company store before, but may have done some research and said, you know what? I'm going to check it out. They start with the website, and they migrate to the store. And so, we're seeing a lot of momentum here. Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Steve, appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter, guys. I wanted to dig... Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you, Peter. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: ....dig into the inflation trend a little bit. It's continued to accelerate here with Q3. Hearing in the channel that some of your large animal feed branded suppliers are now pushing through price increases. I guess, could you confirm that? And how should we think about the inflation trend looking forward in terms of continued acceleration? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Well, I'll start. This is Steve. I don't know if we get into specifics about individual categories or vendors. I will tell you that Tractor Supply has significant purchasing power. So maybe what our competitors are saying is one thing. I'm not going to necessarily suggest that we follow those same trends. In terms of inflation in general, I would tell you that a lot of inflation rises and falls based on commodity prices, which are fairly easy to track. We track those on a regular basis and work with our suppliers based on the trends that we're seeing. So, I think it's a better gauge probably to look at the quantifiable data rather than the subjective. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Peter, this is Kurt. I'll follow up with that on your \u2013 second part of that question. We've seen the inflation rise slightly, it was about a 75 basis point impact in Q2 to about a 90 basis point in Q3. We do expect inflation at this point to continue, perhaps, somewhere around those ranges into Q4. As Steve mentioned, principally in the commodities, looking out, this is very fluid. It's hard to predict. You may start to see some inflation beyond just the commodities as the macro cost pressures start to put emphasis across other categories of it. But we'll continue to balance keeping competitive pricing for our customers as well as managing the margins for our investors. And we've been dealing with inflation and deflation and we'll continue to manage pricing and margins to be rather consistent. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. I'll stick to Mary Winn's rule, and thank you very much. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: We appreciate that. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Much appreciated, Peter. Operator : And next, we'll go to Peter Benedict with Baird. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Peter, are you there? Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, can you hear me? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah, go ahead. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: Yes, now we can. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sorry about that. Just a question around labor management and the opportunities you guys have to use systems or technology to be a bit more efficient, whether that be in the stores or in the distribution centers. That's my first question. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Peter, this is Kurt. We feel good about where we're positioned on labor. I mean, this is certainly a challenging one for the entire environment. But specific to Tractor Supply, we feel good. And I'll mention a few things that we're doing with that. Like great retailers, in a situation like this on labor, you focus not only on managing your wages specific to the market, but you focus on productivity. And we're driving change in our profit improvement initiatives to help offset wage pressures. You've heard us talk about investment in labor hours and wages in the past couple of years. Our focus going forward is laying the foundation for the productivity. And that's a key part of our profit improvement initiative, focusing on that. We'll be utilizing the labor scheduling and task management as well as initiatives that were actually in certain test stores today, testing and adding science into taking work out of certain task functions so that our team members are more focused on serving customers. We believe the combination of those, all participate in helping us being able to offset challenging labor pressures. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Then maybe one for Steve. Just an update on kind of the private brand efforts, where you see the most opportunity for new categories or products to get some private label, or private brand exposure, and then also maybe line extensions? So just your latest thoughts around that, Steve. Thanks. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Well, that's one of our key strategic go-gets on the merchandising front. And I will tell you the team's made some great progress. We've seen ourselves expand in a couple of different lines, including the 4health line. We've recently expanded the Retriever line to a Mossy Oak look, and we think that there's more upside across the entire four walls of the store, to be quite frank with you. I think the bigger challenge that we've got is not just expanding the brands and adding new ones, but marketing them. Now, that's something the team's doing really a lot of right now behind the scenes. And I would tell you, this is where the digitization of our business can really take hold. So very cost effectively, we can build out small vignettes and videos, get them out to our consumer using the social media platforms that we have in the engagement with our customer. And I would tell you, Peter, that we probably have more opportunity in marketing what we have than just expanding more of the brands out at this point. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks, guys Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Peter. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Peter. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: David, I think we've got time... Operator : And we have time for... Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: ...for one more call. Operator : We have time for one more question. Next, we'll go to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for slipping me in. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Nice quarter. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Since we're at the end of the call, I'll keep it pretty quick. But just with regard to weather, I think, Greg or Steve, you commented when talking about the Q3 period that you benefited from, I guess, it was an elongated summer season. But how should we think about the trade-off between that benefit and then what was likely a slower start to the cool temperatures later in the quarter? And then, at least it seems here, I mean things have \u2013 now things have gotten more seasonable, cooled down early in the fourth quarter. I mean, we could just kind of think about how that dynamic \u2013 how it impacted Q3 and how should we think about it in Q4? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Yeah. Brian, this is Steve. Here's what I would tell you. You're looking at the tale (59:39) of both sides. So when I say that, what I mean is that the spring-summer at the very end of the quarter makes up a very small percentage of the total. And the cold winter at the very beginning of the fourth quarter makes up a very small percentage of the overall quarter in fourth quarter. So, if you really bookmark those two, you're not looking at a tremendous amount of material impact. That's how I would phrase that. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's fair. I appreciate it. Again, thanks for the nice quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thanks, Brian. Mary Winn Pilkington - Tractor Supply Co.: That will wrap up our call. We really appreciate you joining us today. We look forward to having you join us on our next quarterly earnings call in January of 2019. As I mentioned at the start of the call, please mark your calendars for our Investment Community Day to be held May 14 and 15 in Nashville. We will be sending out more details in the coming weeks. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and we thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.: Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We will be available for the call \u2013 after the call for follow-up. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call this morning. Fiscal 2018 was another record year for our business. For both the quarter and the full-year, we delivered strong comparable store sales, driven by continued increases in both average ticket and transaction counts. Our Tractor Supply team executed well across store operations, merchandising, supply chain and planning and placement. Our teams did a great job of developing and executing plans that resonated with our customers and that were seasonally relevant, which continued to drive transactions and our average ticket. We continue to be in stock for our customers with our everyday consumables assortments that we know our customers depend on from Tractor Supply to help them live their Out Here lifestyle. I want to thank the more than 30,000 now Tractor Supply and Petsense team members across the country for strong 2018. Our teams did an excellent job of capitalizing on the strong macroeconomic backdrop for our consumer, while executing our many initiatives and our ONETractor strategy. We know our customers look to Tractor Supply for their everyday basic needs in living a rural lifestyle. We believe the continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and the updates to our in-store and online shopping experience are resonating with our customers. Now let me touch on a few financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full-year. For the year, net sales increased 9% to a record $7.9 billion, as we continued our strategy to open new stores to gain market share. Comparable store sales increased a strong 5.7% in the quarter and 5.1% for the year, with both transaction count and average ticket increasing in the quarter and full-year. This was our best annual comp store sales growth in six years. Our fourth quarter results represented the sixth consecutive quarter of comp store sales above 3%, and this quarter represented 42 out of 43 quarters that our customer traffic count has been positive. For the fourth quarter, diluted EPS increased 28% to $1.11. For the full-year, diluted EPS was $4.31, representing a growth of 31%. We generated cash from the operations of $694 million, while returning $497 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchase and quarterly cash dividends for the year. And this was the eighth consecutive year that we increased our quarterly cash dividend for shareholders. In terms of operational highlights for 2018, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 18 Petsense locations, increasing our selling square footage by about 5%. We saw solid progress with many of our ONETractor strategic initiatives and we significantly exceeded our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program membership growth goals. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities and have increased traffic in conversion. Our online sales once again grew strong double digits for the quarter and the year. We significantly enhanced our Buy Online Pickup in Store capability. We expanded our Stockyard in-store kiosk to nearly 600 stores and mobile POS technologies across nearly 400 stores. The relaunch of our private label credit card offered an improved customer value proposition as well, and the integration of Petsense in 2018 made solid progress in our developing of plans for shared service model and our foundation for future growth. We have completed construction of our new distribution center in Frankfort, New York to support our store expansion in the Northeast corridor of the country and that will be starting shipping in 2019. We believe that our capabilities of Buy Online Pickup in Store, mobile POS, Neighbor\u2019s Club, the Stockyard in-store kiosk and our private label credit card, we are uniquely positioned to address the needs of this customer base better than anyone in this fragmented market, and we see significant opportunities to broaden our customer reach and increase our market share as our store base and digital capabilities expand over time. Our ONETractor strategy initiatives are clearly aligned around four key objectives, driving profitable growth, building customer-centric engagement, offering the most relevant products and services and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We will continue to take a balanced approach in managing the business, keeping the long-term in focus. In 2019, our capital spending is allocated across new stores, store-level initiatives, IT projects and, of course, our supply chain. In 2019, we plan to open approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores, and our data continues to support the potential for upwards of 2,500 Tractor Supply store locations over time, as we continue to be pleased with our new store productivity and the returns on those new stores. For 2019, we anticipate opening 10 to 15 new Petsense stores. We continue to believe that the Petsense format provides us with a unique opportunity to grow our pet business by targeting a different customer with a differentiated preference for products and services not available today in Tractor Supply stores. 2018 was a year of system and process integration as we applied best practices from Tractor Supply to Petsense. We have now refined our real estate model for future sites and are focused on gaining scale in select geographic regions as we move forward. In addition, we look to move to a shared service model and further integrate this team. The Petsense team is focused on increasing customer engagement through the use of increased digital marketing, improving our website and improving the customer rewards program to build long-term loyalty. The team\u2019s plans also include increasing the penetration of services such as grooming and training. We believe we have some exciting opportunities ahead for Petsense. But now before I turn the call over to Steve, I would like to address import tariffs. We continue to monitor this very closely and what impact it may have on our products from China. And please keep in mind, we have a large segment of our business, such as our consumable, usable, and edible products that would be impacted very little to none at all, if these tariffs will go into play. Depending on the product category, the team is executing plans to mitigate the potential impact of tariffs. We have been dealing with tariff increases and are prepared if the additional tariffs would go into effect. We will continue to watch this topic closely, as we know it\u2019s a fluid process. So as we celebrated our 80th anniversary in 2018, Tractor Supply has grown from a mail order catalog business offering tractor parts to America\u2019s family farmers to the largest farm and ranch retailer in the country. Our passionate commitment to our customers, team members and communities, as well as our shareholders is the foundation of our profitable growth. I doubt that when our company was founded in 1938, anyone could have imagined that 80 years later, Tractor Supply would be serving customers in more than 1,700 stores in 49 states and is still growing. We remain focused on the future and the long-term growth opportunities ahead of us, and we\u2019re looking forward to another super year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Barbarick : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased with our overall company performance this past year. During the year, we achieved a number of milestones against our ONETractor strategy, while executing across all teams at high levels. The combination of the two resulted in a solid financial performance that exceeded our expectations. For the quarter, our comp sales growth was driven by both average ticket, as well as ongoing increases in customer traffic. We experienced broad-based growth across the number of product categories and in all geographic regions. This is yet another indication that our merchandising plans and marketing events continue to resonate with our customers. Our store teams and supply chain network executed well during the quarter, with the lowest level of store manager turnover in recent years, which I believe has been a significant contributor to our strong customer satisfaction scores. In addition, our on-time service level \u2013 levels from our distribution centers to our stores reached the highest level in five years. As a company, our ability to execute resulted in a comp store sales increase of 5.7% for the quarter, representing a two-year stack of nearly 10%. Many of the performance factors that we experienced earlier in the year continue to benefit us in the fourth quarter. Our strong average ticket growth of 3% was driven by strength and product mix, inflation, and to a lesser extent, growth in big ticket categories. Commodity inflation across categories such as livestock feed, pet food, steel and oil-based products contributed approximately 100 basis points to our average ticket performance. Our average ticket improvement experienced some benefit from big ticket sales. The growth was driven across several product lines, including generators, compressors, heating and chainsaws. Our supply chain\u2019s ability to be responsive and nimble allowed us to capitalize on favorable weather trends, especially early in the quarter. During the quarter, we had both strong sales dollars and unit growth across many of our consumable product lines. Our mission is to be a dependable supplier of basic maintenance products, so that our customers can rely on us on a regular basis. Within these products, strength was broad-based across categories, such as pet food and supplies, bird feeding, animal bedding and forge, to name a few. Our pet food business had another strong quarter, as we continue to drive solid comp sales. Our exclusive brand of 4health Pet Food is a differentiator with our customers, who value premium quality at a great price. At the same time, our entire portfolio of food acts as a competitive advantage for Tractor Supply. Our category management approach to this business allows us to define the role each brand plays in driving our performance. Lastly, store traffic benefited from favorable weather trends during the quarter. We posted solid sales gains in categories such as heating products, apparel, woodcutting and insulated outerwear. The fourth quarter represented our 26th consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth in e-commerce. Our investment in capabilities and breadth of our e-commerce offering is driving sales. Key metrics such as overall visits, unique visits and conversion rate, along with store locator searches, were all positive. Between the combination of our Buy Online Pickup in Store and Direct Delivery to Store, about 70% of our e-commerce orders are fulfilled at our stores. This demonstrates the importance of our store assets and their key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. Importantly, this is a cost-effective way to serve our customers with greater speed, convenience and efficiency. All in, the fourth quarter generated strong sales on top of a solid performance last year. Now, let me turn to some of the key initiatives for 2019, as we build on the success of our ONETractor strategy. As our strategy evolves, we continue to benefit from the early initiatives as they mature. Our focus for the coming year includes the expansion of the Stockyard kiosks, as well as team member mobility solutions, driving the quality and relevance of our Neighbor\u2019s Club engagement, building loyalty through our enhanced private label credit card offering and capitalizing on investments in our supply chain. Turning now to our Stockyard kiosks, this technology will be implemented across the remainder of the chain this year, allowing us to provide even more customers with a long tail of product assortment. We now have more than $100,000 SKUs on our website, compared to the 15,000 to 20,000 in our stores. At the store level, the Stockyard kiosks are a proven tool for driving incremental sales. The mobile point of sale capability will be added to another 700 stores, bringing this technology to about two-thirds of the chain. We know that when we equip our team members with mobility tools, they become more efficient and we see better levels of suggested selling, which in turn equates to higher customer satisfaction scores. We continue to be excited about our Neighbor\u2019s Club results and the long-term opportunity it represents. This program is a transformational and growing asset to drive brand loyalty for Tractor Supply. We are in the process of implementing technology that will further automate our personalization efforts. As we noted last quarter, our one year retention rate is consistently running at nearly 90%, with customer feedback continuing to be overwhelmingly positive. Our sales per customer were up in the year post enrollment, with Neighbor\u2019s Club members shopping three times our average customers. With a strong foundation for personalization established in 2018, our plans for the Neighbor\u2019s Club this year are designed to drive frequency and basket across our customer segments. This personalized and segmented approach allows us the opportunity to grow share of wallet with our members over time. Actionable insights from our Neighbor\u2019s Club membership will also be leveraged across multiple areas of the company, including merchandise all the way to the in-store customer experience. In addition to our Neighbor\u2019s Club program, our customers have responded to our enhanced private label credit card offerings. In 2018, all key metrics associated with our private label credit card increased as a result of more compelling financing offers. Credit card applications are up and the percentage of sales in the card has increased every period since our new offers went into effect in March of this past year. This increase this year, we will increase team member training and messaging to our customers about the major finance \u2013 purchase financing. Over time, we anticipate that this will become a key tool in deepening our relationship with our customers, drive loyalty and increase our share of wallet. Lastly, we continue to make investments across our supply chain. Our newest distribution center in Frankfort, New York started receiving product in December and will begin shipping to our stores during the first quarter. The Frankfort facility will support replenishment to our stores and increase our fulfillment speed for direct-to-customer orders. As we look forward, we continue to be committed to providing our customers with everyday basics that they depend on Tractor Supply for. In addition, we will have a strong assortment of newness planned across our stores and online. Our new spring assortments began arriving earlier this year and customers in the southern part of the country are already responding favorably. To wrap up, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customer\u2019s needs in the coming year, with our in-store and online product offerings, complemented with our customer engagement initiatives, all supported by a nimble supply chain and enthusiastic store team members. I will now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I would echo what Greg and Steve have shared as they reviewed the highlights of the year. Tractor Supply had a strong year in 2018. The fourth quarter of 2018 exceeded our expectation on comp store sales performance, while the quarterly components from gross margin and SG&A played out in many ways, as we expected. During the quarter, we made some strategic business decisions that impacted our gross margin and SG&A performance. Although these actions pressured our results, they were the right steps for the business long-term. Looking at the detail. For the fourth quarter, gross margin decreased 66 basis points to 33.6%. Importantly, these results were in line with our expectations. As we shared with you both at the beginning of the year and again last quarter, we anticipated the fourth quarter gross margin rate to be down to a greater degree than we had experienced coming into the quarter, as we were cycling a 50 basis point improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in freight expense, driven by higher carrier rates and increased diesel fuel prices, as well as an impact from product mix. The increased clearance of Petsense inventory from store closures and inventory rationalization also negatively impacted our gross margin. Partially offsetting these items was the strength of our price management program. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 30 basis points to 25.1% from 24.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation from strong year-over-year performance. Along with planned investments in infrastructure, labor wages and technology to support our strategic long-term growth initiatives. Examples of these investments include the usage of import transload centers and mixing centers to improve product flow-through across our supply chain, along with enhanced customer relationship management initiatives to allow for better digital communication with our customers. The SG&A increase also includes costs associated with the incremental opening and ramp up of operations of our new distribution center in Frankfort, New York, which began receiving product this quarter. During the quarter, we also closed 10 underperforming Petsense locations, resulting in one-time expenses associated with store exit costs. Partially offsetting these SG&A increases were leverage in occupancy and other costs, including store labor from the increase in comparable store sales, along with a one-time benefit due to a change in our vacation policy. Our effective tax rate was 22.2% in the fourth quarter, as we benefited from a lower statutory tax rate and received incremental tax benefits from state tax credits and share-based compensation. The state tax credits were a direct result of increases in our strategic investments. Moving to our balance sheet. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we\u2019re very comfortable with its quality. As we enter the year, we\u2019re well-positioned to wrap up the winter months and transition into the coming spring season. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We\u2019re managing to a leverage ratio of approximately two times adjusted debt to EBITDAR. The majority of our debt is at a very low fixed rate and we are very comfortable with our debt maturity ladder. For the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 5 million shares of our common stock for $349.8 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $147.1 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased nearly $2.5 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $520 million as of the quarter-end. In 2018, we generated cash from operations of $694 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $278.5 million, with approximately 35% of this being maintenance-related and the remaining 65% being growth-oriented in areas such as new stores, digital capability, investments and supply chain infrastructure. Turning now to guidance for 2019. We have a solid plan, as we continue to execute our strategies for long-term success. For 2019, we expect net sales in the range of $8.31 billion to $8.46 billion, an increase of 5% to 7%. Comp store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 2% to 4%. As Greg mentioned earlier, we anticipate opening about 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 new Petsense locations in a similar cadence to 2018 new store openings. Our expect \u2013 expectation is for modest gross margin improvement in 2019. We are forecasting slight pressure on SG&A due to the ramp up of our new distribution center, ongoing wage pressures and higher depreciation expense. Our outlook includes progress on our profit improvement plans to help mitigate cost pressures and our ability to reinvest back into the business over time. The three key work streams of our profit improvement plan are focused on supply chain efficiencies, store productivity and indirect procurement. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities, all on a sustainable basis. We anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of about 8.9% to 9.0%. This outlook is consistent with our expectation that 2018 was a trough year for operating margin. Net income is forecasted in the range of $555 million to $575 million, or $4.60 to $4.75 per diluted share. Comp store sales each quarter are anticipated to be fairly consistent within our annual range of 2% to 4% growth. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first-half of the year and the second-half, as this is in line with how we manage the business. As you model 2019, please keep in mind key factors to the cadence of our profitability growth. Operating profit performance and earnings growth is expected to be stronger in the second-half of the year. The first quarter of 2019 is forecasted to have a modest operating profit decline that will drive net income and diluted earnings per share below the prior year quarter. Three key factors are driving this performance. First, SG&A will be negatively impacted in the first-half of the year by the start-up of our new distribution center, which will not begin shipping until the later part of the first quarter and will ramp up as we move through the year. These incremental expenses will put pressure on our earnings in the first and second quarter, with a more significant impact on the first quarter, as it is our smallest quarter of sales and profitability. Second, we don\u2019t cycle the most significant step up in transportation expenses from 2018 until midyear. And third, our profit improvement initiatives are anticipated to gain more traction in the second-half of the year. Other factors impacting our 2019 quarterly cadence include the shift of Easter holiday weekend completely to the second quarter rather than straddling the first and second quarters as experienced in 2018. And we\u2019ll be cycling a benefit from hurricanes in both the third and fourth quarter of about 40 basis points each that we do not forecast to reoccur. Moving to below the line. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.4% to 22.7%. This is modestly higher rate than we experienced in 2018, as we benefited from incremental state tax credits for capital investments that we don\u2019t reoccur at the same rate in 2019. Year-over-year, the higher tax rate negatively impacts our diluted earnings per share by about $0.02 to $0.04 per share. Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $18 million to $22 million, depreciation expense is estimated to increase 12% to 13%. For the year, our share repurchases are anticipated to range from $350 million to $450 million. For modeling purposes, we have assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 120.5 to 121.5 million shares in 2019. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $225 million to $250 million, with roughly two-thirds of the spending going towards initiatives to support long-term growth. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We also are committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and consistent share repurchases. Overall, we\u2019re doing what we said we would do and executing our plans for 2019. Now I\u2019ll hand it back to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Kurt. In closing, as we\u2019re moving forward and executing our ONETractor strategy, we continue to make operational progress in our business. We are passionate about our future. Our commitment to providing legendary service and great products everyday at low prices will continue to be the foundation of our growth. And with that Mary Winn, we\u2019d now like to open the line for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. David, we\u2019ll take our first call. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is on tariffs. What did you assume in your guidance as far as tariffs? And if we don\u2019t go to 25%, how should that impact the model over the course of the year? Kurt Barton : Sure. Michael, this is Kurt. Our modeling guidance does anticipate that the lift in tariffs and does assume the potential for the March additional tariffs to impact. As we execute that internally, what we do is layer in these tariffs into our model. So if those tariffs were not to occur, we would basically unlayer those and not really have an impact on the guidance that we\u2019ve given to you. So we feel that we\u2019re able to be nimble in an environment with tariffs in the guidance range that we\u2019ve given you. Michael Lasser : Okay. So if the tariffs don\u2019t go to 25%, it shouldn\u2019t really impact your guidance anyway? Kurt Barton : Correct. Michael Lasser : And then my follow-up question is on the weather. It was a little funky during your fourth quarter. What impact can you quantify, do you think the weather had on your performance during the fourth quarter? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Michael, this is Steve. We talked about our customers living the Out Here lifestyle. Weather certainly can have an impact on our business and it did in the early part of the quarter. I will tell you, I applaud the team for, the supply chain team, the merchant team in planning and allocation, because we really took advantage of it with the nimble supply chain that we\u2019ve got. We would estimate that it\u2019s probably somewhere less than 100 basis points of impact to the business and it was certainly in the earlier part of the quarter than the latter. Michael Lasser : Got it. Thank you so much and good luck with the year. Steve Barbarick : Thank you. Gregory Sandfort : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the first quarter guide. Maybe you can just hold our hands as to what your expectation is for margin compression as a result of those factors that you spoke to? And also on the Easter shift, if maybe you could quantify that for us based on what you\u2019ve seen historically? Kurt Barton : Sure. Chuck, this is Kurt. In regard to the first quarter operating profit, as I indicated, we anticipate seeing some modest decline in there. And it\u2019s simply a timing thing specific to a few items that are discrete to the quarter. As I mentioned, the Frankfort DC preopening costs will be in the first quarter. That\u2019s about $0.02 on earnings per share. And as you recall, back in March, I think, third quarter 2017 when we introduced the plans to open the Frankfort DC, we said that it would have roughly about $0.04 impact on earnings per share. And so we\u2019ve had about $0.02 of that impact in the fourth quarter and the other part of that is really the other $0.02 that\u2019s impacting the first quarter. The other additional items, as I mentioned, transportation cost pressures, we do continue to see that. Although, we anticipate that easing in 2019, we\u2019re really not cycling the significant lift until about midyear. So that will have some impact on operating profit in first quarter. And then the third thing is our profit improvement initiatives that are a key part of our strategy for operating margin improvement in 2019, really begin to take hold more in the second-half of the year. So as a reminder, with the first quarter being the smallest quarter, those few things can have an impact and we look at it as timing items that are discrete to the first quarter. In regard to the Easter shift, yes, the Easter shift has really a modest impact in there. We\u2019re not quantifying exactly that. We should remind you that with having Friday and Saturday before Easter falling into the first quarter last year, you lose a slight benefit of that, but not a significant factor into the overall comps. For first quarter, we still anticipate with the easiest compare that first quarter is probably more, in our assumption, at the higher-end of the guided range for the year. Chuck Grom : Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just bigger picture on the macro, particularly in some of these oil markets that you operate. Just curious if you\u2019ve seen any change in basket size, trip frequency, et cetera? Just any overall feel for the consumer right now? Thank you. Gregory Sandfort : Hey, Chuck, this is Greg. I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019re really not seeing any real difference right now in the oil markets, and we are in contact with those stores in the West Texas region, which is primarily where this would be impacted. We talked to them about rig counts and employments and everything seems to be fairly stable. Remember, this is about 10% or less of our stores right now. This is not like what it was in the past when we had many more stores involved in Ohio and Pennsylvania and up to the Oklahoma and the Dakota areas, okay? It\u2019s geographically limited. And I would tell you that one of the advantages we see out of this is, if lower diesel prices can come as a result of lower oil prices, that\u2019s a benefit to us and to our customers. It actually puts a few more dollars in their pocket and can help us on our margin line. So no real difference right now. Chuck Grom : Very helpful. Thanks, and good luck. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So the 3% comp midpoint\u2026 Gregory Sandfort : Good morning. Simeon Gutman : \u2026good morning. The 3% comp midpoint guide for 2019, it seems like a nice solid guide against the 5% for 2018. And so can we talk about the building blocks, Neighbor\u2019s Club inflation and anything that\u2019s give \u2013 giving you a little more confidence in putting up another good number? Kurt Barton : Yes, Simeon, this is Kurt. You know what \u2013 when we modeled out 2019, we basically balanced a number of things in there. And I\u2019d say, we were aware and acknowledged some of the macro headwinds facing retail that\u2019s out there, as well as the strong fundamentals of the business and the initiatives that we see driving it. And you mentioned the key factors, as Steve said, our key initiatives are just early in their days and beginning to take traction. So we anticipate the efforts that we\u2019ve got and the traction from Neighbor\u2019s Club, our financing programs with the private label credit card and continued growth in Buy Online Pickup in Store, those are a number of the factors that we believe allows Tractor Supply to continue to make progress in spite of looking at a year where there is some macro uncertainties facing the industry. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then connected to this, maybe for Greg or Steve. You\u2019ve always done a pretty good job assorting regionally. You probably have gotten better. You have \u2013 now you have Neighbor\u2019s Club, you have a private label credit card you called out and I think that\u2019s helping big ticket and then you mentioned a lot of your business is consumable. And so, even though we talked about the weather, it still comes up, is there signs to you that the business is becoming less weather dependent that we won\u2019t be talking about to have this as much as we had in the past? Gregory Sandfort : One of the things I would tell you Simeon is that, we look at weather as quite frankly, an advantage to Tractor Supply Company. Our customers live the Out Here lifestyle. Now that what I will tell you is that, we benefit, because we are in 49 states. So we\u2019re a bit more desensitized to maybe what we were 10 years ago when we had more stores up North. There are a lot of key fundamental initiatives, as Kurt mentioned, that are very strategic that I think are drivers for the business in the future. But I would always tell you, there will likely be some sensitivity to weather just in the nature of who and what our customers are in the lifestyle they live. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And as a reminder, we ask that all participants please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question. We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys, thanks. Yes, first question is around some of the ONETractor learnings you\u2019ve got in the stores. In the new stores, you\u2019ve got a different layout than generally what you\u2019ve got in the rest of the chain. And I\u2019m just curious how that\u2019s going? And what kind of the thought process is in terms of potentially at some point layering some of those learnings into a broader mix of the stores throughout the chain? That\u2019s my first question. Kurt Barton : Yes, Peter, this is Kurt, I\u2019ll take that. Let me just look back on 2018 and just remind that in 2018 what we accomplished on that, we converted 38 existing stores to the new format and opened up 62 new stores on that format. Our assessment on that new stores, we clearly like the results. Our customers are responding well and our team members like the efficiency of the layout and the format of it existing stores. As you mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to take learning from those tests and apply it to the chain. We do see that in some aspects of the chain, there are more beneficial than others. And an important thing for us is, we\u2019re trying to look for the most benefit with the least amount of capital on existing stores if we were to retrofit it. So looking forward to 2019, we\u2019ll continue to roll out in some existing stores and continue to refine the test and look for the benefits that we can roll out to the rest of the chain. There\u2019s not an official plan to roll out to all stores at this point, but we\u2019ll keep you updated on the positive outcomes and the aspects of the reformat changes, as it may apply to the full chain. Peter Benedict : Okay, that \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just on the private label credit effort, can you talk about, maybe what percentage of sales that was this year or maybe the change year-over-year? And as we cycle the initial, I guess, relaunch of that program in March, kind of what\u2019s untapped to continue to build penetration on private label credit? Where do you think you guys take that maybe over the next couple of years? Thank you. Steve Barbarick : So Peter, this is Steve, I\u2019ll go ahead and take that question. First off, we started from a very low base, which is a good thing. So while we saw really nice double-digit comps in the card, the applications and sales on the card, there\u2019s tremendous upside for us in the future. We haven\u2019t targeted a specific number at this point or said anything publicly. But I can tell you the more training we do with our team members, the more comfortable they get. And then long-term, how we tie that back into our loyalty program, I think, that\u2019s where we can get the greatest benefit. So, again, we\u2019re very early in the process here and I would tell you, there\u2019s still a lot more upside. Peter Benedict : Okay. Great, guys. Thanks very much. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So \u2013 a question with follow-up. So the \u2013 what I want to kind of poke out a little bit and understand better is, one just kind of a understanding of your pet business, how much is private label versus branded? And with that, we\u2019re anticipating Blue Buffalo is going to be rolled into Walmart, probably March, April. And I was wondering if you guys think that\u2019s going to have any kind of impact on you? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Scott, this is Steve. I will tell you, we have been very fortunate to get out ahead of this year as we go as we developed our 4 line \u2013 our 4health product line, as well as the growth we\u2019ve seen in Retriever. We continue to see our pet business growing, both in sales dollars and units. Over the years, we have knowing that a lot of this is coming in terms of some of these national brands that migrate into mass or grocery. We\u2019ve been reducing space and increasing space in more channel specific brands. And one comment or statistic I would share with you is that, over 70% of our assortment is not found in mass or grocery. So, we don\u2019t have nearly the exposure that many others have, as we\u2019ve developed our own private brands and those brands that are more channel specific. Scott Mushkin : All right, thanks for that. Do you give out publicly what\u2019s branded versus private label in your pet business? Steve Barbarick : No, we\u2019ve never shared that data. Scott Mushkin : Never shared the data. Okay, I think that\u2019s the \u2013 I think that was my question follow-up. Also, I have couple more, but I\u2019ll take it offline. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Gregory Sandfort : Okay. Thank you, Scott. Steve Barbarick : Thank you, Scott. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Yes. Good morning, everyone. So Kurt, I was just wondering, you talked about this was the year for trough. This was the trough year in operating margin and that was consistent with the Investor Day last year when you put out your long-term targets. So I was just wondering if you could maybe update us in the sense of how we\u2019re progressing towards those long-term targets? It would seem like the comp certainly performs better than originally expected. Maybe there were some margin pressures that were somewhat incremental. And I\u2019m kind of more focused on the transport cost, because I know you baked some of that pressure into those long-term targets, but are we running a little bit light on margin flow-through just because of transport costs, or is there anything else that we should be aware of in terms of the puts and takes of assessing where you are towards those long-term goals? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, sure, this is Kurt. You hit a couple of the key things. In regards to 2018, we anticipated, set out in the beginning of that year to see some transportation pressures. Those pressures were greater than our original plan. So that was a key factor in regards to how 2018 performed in regards to over operating profit margin. And addition to that, we \u2013 throughout the year, we took, as we mentioned, some strategic decisions on investments throughout the business to really manage for the long-term. In regards to 2019, as I mentioned, we got a solid plan that now allows for as part of our strategic plan to grow operating margin. We\u2019ve got some cost pressures, as I mentioned, but our plan considers a normalized incentive comp. We\u2019ll be cycling some of those cost increases. And on transportation, in particular, we anticipate seeing some easing of those cost pressures, along with the profit improvement issues we have to offset some of the pressures on transportation. Those are a lot of the key factors that allow us to pivot from the pressures from 2018 into a more profitable 2019. Matthew McClintock : So not trying to put words in your mouth and please feel free to deny this or just not even answer it. But just, would that mean that \u2013 would that imply that should you achieve a similar level of comp performance that you did relative to maybe the long-term plan in 2018, we would see it a little bit more margin flow-through on those years and the out years if that\u2019s this year, next year, the year after that, et cetera? Kurt Barton : Yes. I think with less pressure from a variable cost like transportation where we\u2019ve mitigated that, there\u2019s more opportunity with the upside on comps in 2019 and future years. Matthew McClintock : Perfect. And then my second question, just on Petsense. I know it\u2019s small, so I don\u2019t want to focus too much attention on it. But could you just maybe give us a sense of what happened in those 10 stores relative to the rest of the chain, where you decided to reevaluate that decision, et cetera? Just trying to understand as you start to integrate and further integrate Petsense into the bigger chain, the overall chain, where you\u2019ve had some issues where things could be improved, just an update? Thanks. Gregory Sandfort : Yes, Matt, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll pass a little bit to Kurt. Those closings were really related to the new model that we developed for store openings in Petsense. We have a very sophisticated model in Tractor. We\u2019ve taken a very similar modeling approach to Petsense. And when we looked at the whole portfolio, we said, these stores are underperforming and there\u2019s really they\u2019re not the locations we would want moving forward as the rest of the fleet. These were some of the early on stores in the Petsense operation when they started out being in, we\u2019ll call it, discount centers and things of that nature. And so these were early stores that have been targeted even from the beginnings when we had purchased it to say, if we can\u2019t get these moving in the right direction, plus now we developed a new model, it\u2019s best to go ahead and close those. We\u2019re very comfortable now that we\u2019ve got the new model, now that we\u2019ve got a good understanding of what we have and how we\u2019re starting to integrate out of the back house cost in Petsense that we can accelerate the model over the next couple of years and it will be additive to the EPS of the company. Kurt Barton : Yes. And what we saw as a strategic opportunity without a significant impact in 2018, we looked at the opportunity to take those underperforming stores and take those exit costs in 2018. And as Greg mentioned, the profit improvement driven from those 10 stores gives us about $1 million of increased profitability from Petsense in 2019. Matthew McClintock : Thank you very much for that color. I appreciate it. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker : Hi, thanks. A question and a follow-up on your sales outlook. So first, first quarter, you said you should be at the high-end of the plan, which presumably is a 4. Is that based on what you\u2019re seeing now in January, or what do you expect to play out, I think, understanding, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you have easier comparisons as the quarter progresses? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Mike, this is Steve. It\u2019s still early in the quarter. And our first quarter is heavily weighted to the back-half of the quarter. So I want to make sure that we\u2019re clear there. And then while the cool weather of north has certainly been helpful for those stores, we are geographically dispersed across the entire U.S. And we continue to talk about the haves, not the quarters, because there is an interesting dynamic between March and April every year that plays out and when spring will actually occur. So I think we feel pretty comfortable in telling you that we think Q1 will be at the higher-end of our comp range at this point from what we know. Kurt Barton : And Mike, this is Kurt. And to your point, it\u2019s knowing the strength of fundamentals of the core of the business, it\u2019s more about the easier compare in Q1 versus the other three quarters going forward. Michael Baker : Okay. And the follow-up, more \u2013 taking the offset, more of a longer-term question. Your long-term guidance, I believe is for annual sales growth of 7% to 9%. You are at the high-end of that this year. But the guidance for 2019 is only 5% to 7%. Seems to embed a little bit lower new store productivity boost in our math. So can you talk about why you wouldn\u2019t see better sales \u2013 total sales on that 2% comp given your store growth? Kurt Barton : Yes. Mike this is Kurt. The 7% to 9% guide assumes a mix of a certain percentage of new stores and as well a mix and that can fluctuate on the comp basis. In this particular year, it\u2019s more about the timing of the new stores, both with Tractor Supply and Petsense. So with 80 new stores and those \u2013 the cadence of those as well as, as Greg mentioned with Petsense, are focused on getting through the integration, allowing us to have the new systems and the formats and then begin to open those stores that plays into the amount of new stores even from Petsense. And so there\u2019s a few things really more about timing in 2019 that would impact where we landed in the range compared to that long-term guidance. Michael Baker : Okay. But you did say the cadence of openings will be similar in 2019 versus 2018, is that right? Kurt Barton : Yes, you\u2019re right. The cadence for 2019 with Tractor Supply stores similar to 2018, you also had the fact that the previous year prior to 2018, we opened about 100 stores, giving some of that benefit in \u2013 falling into 2018. So there\u2019s some factor from coming off the year of 100 store openings from 2017. Michael Baker : Understood. Okay, thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. A nice job on all the progress. My question is really around the gross margin. I guess, first, if you could size up the mix impact and also the clearance activity in the quarter in Q4 related to Petsense just to give us a sense there? And then the second part, I\u2019ll just combine it. If I heard you right, more of the opportunities on gross margin in 2019, you discussed starting to lap the higher freight by midyear. If you could also address mix and then the price management program, how you\u2019re thinking about that and where you are in that initiative and how that actually starts to gain traction throughout the year, that would be helpful? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes. So, Seth, this is Kurt. There\u2019s a few questions in there. Let me go through there. Steven and I are making some notes, and let me address the first question on Q4. We called out the key factors on the gross margin comparison fourth quarter. The most important thing is just keeping in mind, we\u2019re cycling a 50 basis point improvement in the prior year, where there were some discrete benefits in the prior year and then additionally, the freight cost pressures and the mix shift of product. The least of the things we mentioned was really the liquidation of the Petsense. I can just tell you that was less than 10 basis points of the overall gross margin impact on fourth quarter, but we wanted to call that out as part of it. And then if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I think you had some questions more about 2019, if you could just give that back to us, we\u2019ll try to address that. Seth Sigman : Yes. I just love to get a little bit more color specifically on the price management program, where you are in that initiative? Any examples on on how you\u2019re using it? And then you did mention as an offset, I guess, how meaningful is that today? Where can that go over time? Thanks. Steve Barbarick : Yes, Seth, this is Steve. We are continuing our journey with price management and we\u2019ve talked significantly about it over the years. And it\u2019s really an elasticity tool that allows us to go out through the number of zones that we have and understand what customer demand does whenever prices go up or down based on how we put them into a category management model here. We think that will be a key instrument or tool for us as we go through what could be more tariffs or, however, we want to manage our business regarding market share. So that will be a key, I guess, tool for us as we move forward. So there\u2019s still a lot of upside, still a lot of opportunity that we haven\u2019t fully capitalized on and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll use it. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. I just had a follow-up question around the tariff scenario. You mentioned that you don\u2019t expect any change to your 2019 outlook, whether or not we stay at 10% tariffs or go to 25% tariffs. Last quarter, Greg, I believe you indicated, you expect margin pressure from a 25% tariff scenario. So has that thought process changed? Gregory Sandfort : I\u2019ll quickly address and then probably pass either to Steve or Kurt. That comment was made more about, we were uncertain at that time what it was going to look like. We\u2019ve just been to two rounds, if you remember, of tariff impacts. We were trying to estimate at that point if we went to 25%, what do we think would happen and anticipating that we had to put a plan in place to address it. We\u2019ve now done that. We feel very comfortable with the plan. So I would say, now we\u2019re not as concerned about that pressure. We\u2019ve got it handled. We know what we need to do. I would hope that we can avoid this. But if it does happen, we are well-prepared and ready to act upon it and we don\u2019t see it as a real margin drain. Seth Basham : Got it. And what about from a comp perspective? Will you expect your comp outlook to be different if we stay at 10% tariff versus 25% tariff? Gregory Sandfort : That\u2019s the question that no one can answer, okay? We\u2019re \u2013 look, we\u2019re very fortunate as a company that we have a business that is grounded in staples. And those staples will continue to sell whether we\u2019re through a recession or we\u2019re through a major tariff impact or what have you. But some of the discretionary products, we could see some pressure. But right now, we\u2019re not seeing really anything significant. So I guess, what I would say to you is, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but we\u2019ll be very well priced regardless of this. We\u2019ve got some leverage with some of our manufacturers, as you can imagine, with our size. And at this point, it\u2019s a wait and see. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Gregory Sandfort : Good morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : So \u2013 hi. So I know you guys have posted three straight quarters now of average ticket growth of, let\u2019s call it, 3%-plus after, call it, five years of pretty much flattish performance. Can you, number one, rank order kind of what has inflected positive on average ticket, because I know you\u2019ve got a couple of initiatives in there? And then second, can you provide any specifics or quantify the impact that your deferred financing program has had on average ticket? It can\u2019t be completely coincidental that you launched the deferred financing in March of 2018 and then you come away with three straight quarters of 3%-plus average ticket growth? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Scot, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll start by answering a bit of the prioritizing of it and Steve may be able to give some color on it. But specific to the fourth quarter, when you look at the average ticket growth, the product mix was the most impactful of it, followed by inflation. As we said, inflation had about 100 basis point impact on average ticket and third to the big ticket. And the big ticket can differ in any particular quarters. And I think, second quarter was probably one of the primary drivers of it. And so for the fourth quarter, those were the three primary drivers. And Steve can maybe speak to anything else on the growth, the average ticket mix. Steve Barbarick : The only other thing I would mention, you talked about the private label credit card and longer-term financing. And we are seeing customers, as we\u2019ve gotten a program more competitive, take advantage of it, but it\u2019s still a very small portion of our total business. And so there are other things that we\u2019re working on to drive ticket up, because we have good, solid transaction growth. Most of those are operational and in merchandising, and I think we\u2019re seeing some benefits from the work we\u2019re doing there. And in the long haul, I do think that the private label credit card will benefit us in some of the bigger ticket. But as Kurt said, it was probably ranked three in the \u2013 on the list of priorities that we saw in the quarter. Scot Ciccarelli : Is there any kind of metric we maybe should be looking at, or trying to evaluate on the deferred financing to kind track what kind of impact it could have? Kurt Barton : Well, I\u2019ll tell you, Scot, what we look at is and what\u2019s important for us is the number of applications that are in our program, which is growing well. The number of new members, new cardholders, as well as the year-over-year growth. And those \u2013 Steve mentioned that all of those are positive in the quarter. We\u2019re focusing not on just how to use it for big ticket one-time sales, but how do we continue to have everyday purchases on there. And so as this program grows from something very small to something that\u2019s meaningful, we\u2019ll be able to share additional information on that. And at this point, we\u2019re excited about coming out of an early program with some positive results. We want to be able to continue to mature it and become part of our long-term strategy, certainly even aligned with our Neighbor\u2019s Club program. Scot Ciccarelli : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Mary Winn Pilkington : I think we\u2019ll take one more question as we\u2019re about to hit the top of the hour. But we\u2019d have time for one more question, please. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good morning. Gregory Sandfort : Good morning. Steven Forbes : I want to start with Neighbor\u2019s Club membership. Can you update us on the total membership number as of Q4-end. And then maybe discuss what you\u2019re seeing, right, within the members themselves as it relates to category penetration rate? Are you seeing your member shop new categories as they mature throughout the program? Steve Barbarick : Let me give you a basic update, Steve, on total. One of the things that we\u2019re seeing are continued positive trends in enrollment. And like what we talked about before, we\u2019re well over $10 million. That number will continue to scale and we see continued growth there. I will share with you a statistic, I think, that\u2019s a milestone, and that was this past quarter, over 50% now of our sales are being generated by our loyalty members, and that\u2019s given us given us some really rich information. A couple of things that we\u2019re looking at is the segmenting of customers based on both product needs and wants, the tiering of our customers by frequency and spend and it\u2019s also giving us a better sense for the demographics that are part of our membership. All that data that we\u2019re taking is being used by our analytics team and we\u2019re sharing it internally, so that we can start modifying assortments and tweaking regional opportunities that we\u2019ve got. But because we\u2019ve got access to all these customers e-mail addresses, we\u2019re able to personalize content that is relevant to them, and we\u2019re seeing some traction. As I said, the members that we\u2019ve had over a year are shopping us more often. And if you look at the top 25% of our stores that have a higher penetration of Neighbor\u2019s Club sales, they are the top performing comp store sales stores that we have. So I would tell you that the program is still early in its maturity. And as we continue to scale, not only the membership, but the quality of the members that we have and that\u2019s our focus. I think, we\u2019re going to learn more and be able to continue to action it. Steven Forbes : And then just a real quick follow-up. So you talked about the impact to gross from Petsense inventory rationalization. Well, can you quantify the store exit costs that were also recognized? Kurt Barton : Yes, Steven, the store exit costs were not significant. What I will tell you is that, as we exited out of Q4 and looked at the year-end, we had both some cost up with Petsense, as well as a credit on the vacation policy change. The two of those netted to something less material. The adjustments overall were net about a one on those non-recurring items, were about $0.01 to EPS. So it really wasn\u2019t that significant. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Steve Barbarick : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : David, I think that will wrap up our call. Thank you for joining the call today. Marianne and I will be around if you have any questions. We look forward to talking to you on our first quarter call in April. Additionally, we will be hosting our Annual Investment Community Day on May 15 here in Nashville. Hope you can join us, and thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg. Greg Sandfort : Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. Our first quarter 2019 was really a great start for Tractor Supply. We delivered strong comparable store sales driven by continued increases in both average ticket and transaction counts. Our Tractor Supply team executed well across store operations, merchandising, supply chain and planning and placement. The team did a great job allocating products to capitalize on the varying weather trends across the regions of the country as we move through the quarter. We had better than anticipated comparable store sales, effectively managed our gross margin performance and balanced our SG&A expenses, successfully controlling those elements that were in our control. Our results were driven by broad-based strength across all geographic regions as well as increases in both comparable store transactions and average ticket and all major product categories achieved positive comp sales in the quarter. Our first quarter results represent the seventh consecutive quarter of comp store sales running above a 3% comp. Now, let me touch on the few highlights for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year. Comparable store sales increased 5% in the first quarter with both transaction count and average ticket increasing. Net sales increased 8.3% to $1.82 billion for the quarter as we continued our strategy to open new stores. Diluted EPS was $0.63, an increase of 10.5%. We returned $193 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter. And based upon our performance year-to-date, we are confirming our full year financial guidance. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some of the operational highlights of the quarter. Our distribution center in Frankfort, New York began shipping product to stores in the Northeast. We opened 10 new Tractor Supply stores and 1 Petsense location. This quarter marks our 27th consecutive quarter of strong double digit sales growth in our e-commerce business. During the quarter we continued to experience strong growth with our Buy Online Pickup in Store program. Between the combination of our Buy Online Pickup in Store and Direct Delivery to Stores, the majority of our e-commerce orders are being fulfilled at stores and our stores continue to play a key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. With our capabilities we believe the Neighbor\u2019s Club personalization, Buy Online Pickup in Store, Stockyard in-store ordering kiosk and our competitive private label credit card and mobile point of sale rollout uniquely positioned us to serve the customer base better than anyone in this fragmented market. And we see significant opportunities to broaden our customer base and increase market share as our store base and digital capabilities expand over time. As we have stated before our ONETractor strategy is clearly aligned around four objectives, driving profitable growth, building customer centric engagement, offering the most relevant products and services and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We continued to take a balanced approach to managing our business, keeping the long-term in focus. As we look to the future, I think it is important to recognize how much progress we have made. We have invested in our infrastructure to support enhanced capabilities, to capitalize on the convergence of our physical stores and digital sales for a seamless shopping experience. We have strengthened our core with key investments including wages for our team members. And as a result our turnover is down year-over-year and I believe we are building a strong foundation for future growth of the company. In 2019 our capital spending is prioritized to new stores with an increase of capital dedicated to customer insight and store service initiatives as well as our supply chain. We are investing in technology to strengthen our execution and maximize efficiencies in our stores, so our teams can shift their focus from task to driving customer service. As we have shared with you our real estate modeling process continues to support the potential for upwards of 2,500 tractors supply store location over time. And we continue to be pleased with our new store productivity and returns. While the timing for opening a number of our new stores in 2019 has shifted a bit more to the second half of the year, we remain on track to open 80 new tractor supply stores and 10 to 15 new Petsense store locations. I believe our ONETractor strategy positions us well to meet the unique preferences of our customers because they have demand driven immediate need of products and they want it in an easy and seamless shopping experience anytime, anywhere and anyway they choose. Now I will turn the call over to Steve for more detail regarding several of the merchandising, marketing and supply chain initiatives. Steve Barbarick : Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results are very encouraging. For the quarter our comp sales growth was driven by both average ticket as well as ongoing increases in customer traffic. We experienced broad based growth across the number of product categories in all geographic regions. This was the continuation of the trends that we experienced as our merchandising plans and marketing events are resonating with our customers. In addition our store teams and supply chain network executed well during the. The teams were effective in capitalizing on the various weather fronts across all regions. Whether it was winter weather that lingered in key markets or more moderate spring like temperatures arriving across the south, we leveraged our supply chain which allowed us to be there for our customers with the right products at the right time. As a company our ability to execute resulted in the comp sales gains of 5% for the quarter representing a 2 year stack of 8.7%. Many of the performance factors we experienced in 2018 continue to benefit us in the first quarter. Our strong average ticket growth of 3.2% was driven by strength in retail price management, product mix, growth in big ticket along with some commodity inflation. We continued to experience strong sales in many of our consumable products with notable strength in heating, lubricants, pet products, animal feed and forage. These are stable categories that our customers depend on us for and drive repeat traffic to our stores. This quarter\u2019s performance reflects our commitment to being the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs for those customers that live the Out Here lifestyle. In addition to our consumable businesses, we also experienced broad-based strength across categories such as truck and towing products, tools and hardware. Lastly, store traffic benefited from favorable weather trends during the quarter. We posted solid sales gains in categories such as wood cutting, insulated outerwear and cold weather outdoor power equipment. In addition, we experienced positive comps in spring seasonal categories. Lawn and garden products, lawn cutting equipment, outdoor power equipment products and accessories will all comp positive for the quarter. The first quarter represented our 27th consecutive quarter of strong double-digit comps in e-commerce. Our investment in capabilities and breadth of our e-commerce offering is driving sales. Key metrics such as overall visits, unique visits and conversion rate along with store locator searches were all positive. Between the combination of our Buy Online, Pickup in Store and Direct Delivery to Store, approximately 70% of our e-commerce orders are fulfilled at our stores. This demonstrates the importance of our store assets and their role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. Importantly, this is a cost effective way to serve our customers with greater speed, convenience and efficiency. All-in, the first quarter was a solid start to the year. As we look forward, we continue to be committed to providing our customers with the everyday basics. In addition, we have a strong assortment of newness planned across our stores and online. Our spring assortments are set across the chain. We have new product resets across categories such as lawn and garden, live goods and outdoor power equipment, including an expanded offering of Husqvarna, all while delivering localized and relevant product assortments that support the lifestyle of our customer. At Tractor Supply, sign of spring is the arrival of our annual Chick Days event. Every spring, Tractor Supply customers look forward to the arrival of live chicks and ducklings. We offer everything a seasoned or novice backyard poultry keeper needs to care for their flock, where stores carry an extensive line of chicken care and poultry products with an expanded assortment available online. As a team, we are committed to building our organizational capabilities. Our focused areas this coming year include driving quality and relevance of our Neighbor\u2019s Club engagement, building royalty to an enhanced private label credit card offering, expanding the stockyard kiosks as well as team member mobility solutions. We continue to be excited our Neighbor\u2019s Club results and the long-term opportunity it represents. This program is a transformational and growing asset to drive brand royalty for Tractor Supply. We are in the process of implementing technology that will further automate our personalization efforts. As we noted last quarter, our 1 year retention rate is consistently running at nearly 90% with customer feedback continuing to be very positive. Our sales per customer are up in the year post enrollment with Neighbor\u2019s Club members shopping 3x our average customers. With the foundation of personalization established in 2018, our plans are designed to drive frequency and basket across our customer segments. This personalized and segmented approach allows the opportunity to grow share of wallet with our members over time. Using our Neighbor\u2019s Club data, we can effectively map out and manage customer lifecycle interactions, drive key customer segments and deliver relevant and timely content leveraging artificial intelligence. In addition to our Neighbor\u2019s Club program, our customers have responded to our enhanced private label credit card offerings. This year, we are investing in increased training for our store team members on the benefits of the TSC card to our customers. Over time, we anticipate the card will become a key tool to deepen our relationship with our customers, drive loyalty and increase our share of wallet. Our research shows that customers have become TSC credit card holders, visit our stores an additional 2x per year and spend more. At the store level, stockyard kiosks are a proven tool for driving incremental sales. We anticipate a complete rollout across the chain by the end of the year. Lastly, we continue to make investments across our supply chain. Our newest distribution center in Frankfort, New York began shipping the stores during the first quarter. The Frankfort facility will support replenishment to our stores and increase our fulfillment speed for Direct to Customer orders. Just last week, we also opened a new mixing center in North Carolina to better support our in-stock position of fast-turning products while reducing total inventory in the store. This brings our total number of mixing centers across the network to 5 locations. In summary, we believe we are ready for a solid selling season with differentiated products and a customer engagement approach that will not only surprise and delight our customers, but allow them to live life on their terms. I will now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Steve and good morning everyone. Echoing what you have heard from Greg and Steve, I am pleased with the balance in the first quarter across our top line growth, margin improvement and SG&A performance that resulted in operating profit expansion. For the first quarter of 2019 we had strong comp store sales growth of 5.0% which was driven by 1.8% increase in comp transaction count and a 3.2% increase in average ticket. All months of the quarter were comp positive and Petsence comp store sales increase was in line with our chain average. For the first quarter gross margin increased 26 basis points to 33.8%. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by strong sell through of winter seasonal categories and the continued strength of our price management program. These increases were partially offset by increased transportation costs, principally from higher carrier rates which were in line with our expectations and the assumptions in our guidance. Including depreciation and amortization SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 21 basis points to 28.1%. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to incremental costs associated with the new distribution center in Frankfort, New York as well as incentive compensation for store and field team members from the strong year-over-year performance and to a lesser extent investment in team member wages. These SG&A increases were partially offset by leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Specific to the ramp up of our Frankfort distribution center, we estimate that about 25 basis points of our SG&A increase as a percentage of sales is attributable to the startup of the distribution center in the first quarter. That should not reoccur at the same rate of de-leverage for the balance of the year. All-in, we were pleased with our underlying expense control which helped to contribute to the modest operating profit increase. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in at 22.0%. This was modestly below our full year expectation primarily due to an incremental tax benefit associated with higher stock option exercises year-over-year. This provided a favorable impact discrete to the quarter on the effective tax rate. Now to our balance sheet and cash flow, our accounts payable leverage was about 41.7% at the end of the first, a modest improvement year-over-year. At quarter end our merchandise inventories were $1.89 billion, an increase of 2.7% on a per store basis from the 2018 first quarter. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are very comfortable with its quality. As the spring selling season continues to progress, we are well positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for spring and summer seasonal products. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. For the quarter we repurchased about 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $155.3 million and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.31 per common share outstanding totaling $37.6 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased just over $2.6 billion of our common stock and our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $365 million as of the quarter end. Turning now to our outlook, we have not made any changes to our full year outlook for 2019 and we continue to forecast net sales in the range of $8.31 billion to $8.46 billion, an increase of 5% to 7%. Comp store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 2% to 4%. Our expectation remains for modest gross margin improvement in 2019. We are forecasting slight pressure on SG&A due to the ramp up of our new distribution center, ongoing wage pressures and higher depreciation expense. Our outlook includes progress on our profit improvement plans to help mitigate cost pressures and our ability to reinvest back in the business over time. The three key work streams of our profit improvement plan are focused on supply chain efficiencies, store productivity and indirect procurement. The team has made great progress and is on track for our plans for the year. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities all on a sustainable basis. We anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of about 8.9% to 9.0%. Net income is forecast in the range of $555 million to $575 million or $4.60 to $4.75 per diluted share. Comp store sales each quarter are anticipated to be fairly consistent within our annual range of 2% to 4% growth. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business. As you model 2019, please keep in mind key factors to the cadence of our profitability growth. Operating profit performance and earnings growth is expected to be stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we will be cycling a benefit from hurricanes in both the third and fourth quarter of about 40 basis points each. Moving to below the line, our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.4% to 22.7%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $225 million to $250 million, with roughly two-thirds of the spending going towards initiatives to support long-term growth. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We are also committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and consistent share repurchases. Overall, we were pleased with the first quarter and continue to do what we said we would do as we execute our plans for 2019. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Greg. Greg Sandfort : Thank you, Kurt. And in closing, first quarter was a great way to start out the year. I want to thank the nearly 30,000 team members across our organization, the dedication, their hard work and for consistently placing our customers first in everything they do. I believe our results are directly correlated to our team members\u2019 efforts. Our commitment to provide legendary service and great products at everyday low prices will continue to be the foundation of our growth. And with that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the line for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : David? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. You cited retail price management in both \u2013 as both benefit to your average ticket and gross margin. Can you give us some more specifics around what that driver is and how much is more of an opportunity there is to benefit from it? Steve Barbarick : Sure, Michael. This is Steve. For years, we have been talking about investing in our pricing tools and those tools have really helped us analytically assess elasticity and make appropriate changes, where they need to be made. As we went into this year, we recognized as we have restructured our pricing program out in the field that there was future opportunity and so we took advantage of that tool. And I would say that at the end of the day, it assesses elasticity and demand and we feel like we are in a really good spot with it. So it\u2019s a tool that we have used in the past. We just cited it probably this time a little more than we typically have and we will continue to lean and leverage that system as we move forward. Kurt Barton : And Michael, this is Kurt. I will add to what was saying. In regards to the second part of your question, first quarter, the team did an excellent job capitalizing on margin opportunities that were specific to first quarter, particularly on the winter seasonal product. So extending the margin benefit in Q1 into future quarters is it\u2019s a little bit hard to fully extend that into those other quarters as we had some success in areas that were discrete to the quarter. But as I indicated, we do anticipate to have modest gross margin improvement throughout the year. Michael Lasser : And Kurt, that leads to my second question you did have a very good first quarter with upside to at least what the consensus forecast were and yet you maintained your guidance for the full year. Is your anything aside from some of those unique factors that mentioned in the first quarter \u2013 is there anything we should be mindful as we are modeling north of the year given that you did maintain your guidance? Kurt Barton : Yes, Michael, I mean we acknowledge Q1 as both Greg and Steve said was a clear success for us above our initial expectations both on top and bottom line. But as we said, we faced strong tough compares in all the remaining three quarters on the top line and we have a vast majority of the year still ahead of us. So, we haven\u2019t really pointed anything out. I think it\u2019s just with a strong level of the majority at this point. Consistent with our practice, we believe it\u2019s a good and prudent thing to maintain our guidance on the reminder of the year. Michael Lasser : Thank you so much and good luck with the rest of the year. Kurt Barton : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : Alright. And next, we will go to Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Oliver Wintermantel : Yes, good morning guys. I just want to follow-up on the gross margin side. I understand there were some specifics in the first quarter, but if I think about the headwinds that you mentioned it was transportation cost or the rate of transportation with a headwind in the first quarter. If I understand right that should get easier throughout the year, I think we are going to lap some of those \u2013 is that going to be that maybe a tailwind in the later part of the year? Kurt Barton : Yes, Oliver. This is Kurt. Yes, you are correct on transportation year-over-year, I mean, the first, they still were up. I will give you a couple of points on transportation and then answer the last part of your question. Our transportation costs had a growth year-over-year. We did see some easing of some of those cost pressures even in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations, particularly in the area of fuel and common carrier costs. And we also saw some success with the progress we are making on transportation. Our spot rate usage is down year-over-year and this is really the third quarter we made progress on reducing the usage on spot rate. And we also saw progress on reducing some of our stem miles. So, we are going to continue to focus on transportation. And while those costs year-over-year are anticipated to be slightly higher, they will begin to moderate in the back half of the year as we begin to cycle some of those step-ups. And all of that is anticipated in our guidance. So we don\u2019t really anticipate at this point to see anything significantly different than we have guided on the overall gross margin. Oliver Wintermantel : Alright. I stick with one question. Thanks very much. Kurt Barton : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So wanted to get your thoughts in terms of how the spring season has played out so far this year regionally, did it arrive earlier year-over-year in the south and what\u2019s your view in terms of how it\u2019s played out and then northern regions have a lot of retailers talking about weather on the retail calendar quarter. So just curious what you have seen so far and what you think is ahead? Steve Barbarick : Yes, Chris this is Steve. We always talk about weather plays some factor in our business especially when you talk about customers who live \u201cout here.\u201d What I would tell you is that as stated early in the commentary, we saw strength in both the fall weather side of our business, but we also saw some strength in the seasonal goods and they comped off. So as we look at it fortunately for us we are geographically dispersed, we are prepared for spring as we go forward. I don\u2019t want to get in the specifics of the individual regions, but I can tell you that we have got product set and as the season continues to move north, we will take advantage of it. Christopher Horvers : Understood. So it sounds like it did sort of hit the south was really the early spring seasonal selling in the first quarter and it\u2019s been moving north since then? Steve Barbarick : I think that\u2019s\u2026. Christopher Horvers : Okay. So the other I think hot topic out there is to take an improvement that you have been able to really drive, was that inflected in the second quarter of last year. Can you sort of somehow size the buckets of what drove ticket between the price management in the credit card and the inflation and so forth and how are you thinking about sort of lapping against that ticket comparison as it steps up here in 2Q, do you expect it to moderate or do you think that what you are doing around BOPIS and the kiosks can continue the strong ticket growth going forward? Kurt Barton : Chris, this is Kurt, I will just hit a couple of the highlights on there. As Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks on the average ticket there was a number of key contributors and that\u2019s the excellent point that the average ticket benefited from good strong price management ensuring that we can offset some of those cost increases particularly in the areas of transportation. But we had positive comps in big ticket. Our big ticket comps for the quarter was in line with the overall chain average and that contributed to the average ticket. It wasn\u2019t the primary, but it was one of the key contributors. But also the efforts we have got on adding units in the basket and the efforts to continue to improve our selling along with our private label credit card all contributed to that. And as we lap the future, I mean the success of the quarters going forward, we are really excited about and we have good confidence in our initiatives in these particular areas to be able to lap the improvement we saw in average ticket going forward the rest of the year. Christopher Horvers : You mean, continue to put up average ticket increases? Kurt Barton : That\u2019s in our assumption, yes. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much. Have a great spring. Kurt Barton : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good morning. I wanted to focus on the credit card program and really the special financing options ahead of the spring selling season here, so if possible can you provide some color regarding the customers usage and our response to the offering thus far. And then maybe comment on how view Tractor\u2019s offering like the special financing options relative to what you are seeing from the local competitors out there, local independents from just so we have engaged competitive going for those big ticket sales? Kurt Barton : Steven, this is Kurt. Let me give you a couple of highlights on the progress with the private label credit card. We are very pleased with the performance. I will give you some indications on the progress on it. The general key metrics that we look for at or above our expectations, we look at the number of applications, our active accounts including repeat visits from those customers, all of those key metrics continued to move positively for us in line with what we expected. And we are really excited about aagain another where the tender mix on the card and up strong double-digits. So what is resonating with our customers, we see a good connectivity and correlation on bigger ticket items as well. And when it comes to comparison to prior year or what\u2019s being offered out there, this year in the spring a couple of key differences year-over-year were consistent throughout the spring selling season on our deferred financing offers. Those bigger ticket deferred financing offers that were on and off a bit with some of the adds last year will be consistent. And then also we introduced late last year or offer where in certain price levels you can choose the deferred financing or 5% off. And we believe that resonates differently with customers. And there is a segment of our customer that, that resonates better than deferred financing. So overall, we have got a very competitive offering when we look at what the competition has and a greater offering than even last year in the second quarter. Steven Forbes : And then just a quick follow-up on the full year revenue guidance, right, so if we think back to January when you provided the initial guide, I believe there were some caution, right, so you can have early, you had the guide in the year around the potential impact to demand from the anticipated increase in the tariff rates, so maybe just update us on how tariffs are incorporated into the guidance, now that we are past March, right and have better visibility to the full year? Greg Sandfort : Steven, I just go back to what we said on the last call that we believe what we can be and have the ability to be nimble in how we manage that. We new there was a risk of wave three coming or not perhaps and as we know how that played that, our ability to yield a add-on or layer off the tariffs gives us a good competitive advantage. And we also said we felt with it you might have some challenge of the demand or the traffic, but yet an offset on the ticket and we believe that tariffs can have a pretty even offset. So it really doesn\u2019t impact significantly anything that we see going forward in the remaining quarters for the year. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Okay. And next we will go to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to dive into the pet business a little bit, talk about how it\u2019s going, what kind of inflation you are experiencing, some of our data since pets become inflationary, so I didn\u2019t want to get your read on what\u2019s going on in the pet business? And then I had a follow-up. Steve Barbarick : Yes, Scott, this is Steve. Overall, we are still running solid comps both on the food side as well as on the supply side. Our focus around pet is really been around our own private or exclusive brands, that in those brands are really more differentiated and channel specific. And if you look at our assortment, 70% of those brands that we sell are not mass or grocery and that\u2019s what we are seeing a lot of the strength in our business. There is some inflation, but it\u2019s not significant to the total and it\u2019s not necessarily material to our overall company\u2019s performance. Scott Mushkin : That\u2019s perfect. And then I wanted to kind of talk about the \u2013 you have been remodeling some stores, I know you have a new store format out there, but I want to get an update on those stores are performing versus the kind of the stores they replaced? And I am wondering also which ONETractor effort is driving the most incremental sales? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Hey, Scott. This is Kurt. Yes, it\u2019s correct. We did start to last year introduce that new layout format not only in new stores, but began to test and roll it out into some of our retrofit existing stores. At this point, we are still assessing the performance of the retrofit stores and the ROI just like we would do with any remodel or investment in existing stores. At this point, the investment return isn\u2019t where we wanted to be to warrant further or a larger scale expansion, but it\u2019s still very early. What I can tell you also though is we will continue to test and modify in those stores and we are taking some of the learnings and applying that to the chain where appropriate. And we are all really excited about the impact it\u2019s having on the new stores and we are continuing to open up new stores with that format. Greg Sandfort : And I think the other portion to your question had to do with what parts of ONETractor we are most excited about. I would tell you within the formats themselves, we have seen benefits across a couple of different areas. But one of the things it\u2019s given us confidence is we put the stockyard kiosk into these ONETractor formats. And seeing the results that we have gotten there has given us confidence to expand that program to all stores by the end of this year. So from a technology standpoint and getting our customers comfortable with using the technology, supporting buy online, pickup in store, our team members comfortable with it. That\u2019s where we are really seeing a lot of benefit in the new capabilities. Scott Mushkin : Alright, perfect guys. Thanks. Good luck for the rest of the year. Kurt Barton : Thanks, Scott. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Josh Kamboj : Hi, this is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon. In light of the higher current run-rate over the past few quarters and ignoring some of the factors like weather, obviously you are targeting your existing customers there, but do you think that you are also capturing a large swathe of new customers and if so where might they be coming from? Steve Barbarick : Yes, this is Steve. And I will take that one. We have had a good stream over the last 40 plus quarters of comp transaction growth. And I would tell you a lot of that growth is a result of new customers being introduced to the brand. They are being introduced to the brand through a lot of different marketing vehicles. And one of the ones that I think is probably the most significant for our brand is the actual website itself. There is a lot of customers. And if you look at our traffic on our site, if you look at unique visits, if you look at store locator clicks, it\u2019s very easy to be sitting in your home and pull up \u2013 see something from a Tractor Supply banner ad that runs across a website you are looking at, you click on it and you are introduced to the brand. And I think that, that right there is the new front door for Tractor Supply Company. So, I would suggest looking at the data that we have got as we continue to scale Neighbor\u2019s Club and understanding who our customers really are, there is a tremendous amount of value in getting our brand out there in different vehicles in digital in my opinion is the way to bring new customers in. So that\u2019s what I would tell you. Josh Kamboj : Alright, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, your core customers are obviously engaging with you a lot more closely during the past initiatives that you have outlined. Do you have a sense of your wallet share of those core customers you are able to quantify that in anyway? Steve Barbarick : That\u2019s always been difficult for us. And part of the reason is as we compete with a lot of folks that are private in our space. And so we have been reluctant to really give out some of the initial insights that we have at this point as we continue to assess the data, but our business is very unique. It\u2019s incredibly fragmented. And at this point I don\u2019t have any specifics for you. Josh Kamboj : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Good morning guys. Great quarter. Just wanted to circle back on the gross margin a little bit on the gross margin line, specifically in the first quarter, how much was mix versus price management? And I guess how big a drag was transportation cost and looking ahead to the second quarter and the balance of the year, how do we think about those moving parts, it sounds like mix may not be as good, but it also sounds like transportation may not be as bad? I am just trying to size up the moving parts on the GPMI? Kurt Barton : Sure, Chuck, this is Kurt. If I heard the question right, gross margin mix versus price and then impact the transportation, exciting that all key factors mix and price were both contributors on the gross margin side of it. And pricing for the first quarter for the things that we pointed out are particularly on price management as well as capitalizing on demand on winter merchandizing a solid sell through those were the primary two contributors that were larger than the benefit from mix and transportation costs were in line with what we expected which is showing as I indicated some easing and less of pressure then it was in Q3 and Q4 of last year, but it still was a key factor in gross margin and we are really excited about as we continue to learn and manage through that not only driving some efficient in transportation, but being able to manage the pricing to be able to pass on some of those incremental cost to our customer during the quarter overall we manage the transportation increases well from both sides of that. Chuck Grom : Okay great. And then on your prepared remarks you talked about mapping out the customer life cycle I think it is kind of [indiscernible] as you guys start to gain more knowledge about your customer to royalty in the card just wondering like how you think about that over time what you have learnt so far and what\u2019s the progression could potentially be? Steve Barbarick : Yes this is Steve. I will tell you that the way it is scaled is really giving us some deep insights in our customer not just the frequency but the amount they spend year-over-year spend what categories they spend within the benefit of the life cycle is taking that data and then welcoming new customers and watching them grow and mature into the lifestyle that we had in communicating on a very relevant and personalize basis to them so that were not only talking about the categories that they purchase today but we can cross sell of so of those customers we recently implemented their campaign management tool and they give you a sense for it we are not able to scale or emails and then in the last campaign we actually were able to have 4000 different versions all that email sent out to individual customers to really talk what we have previously, we are ruling more of a mass email deliver so between that and been able to really shift our spend in advertising the more digital we see this is real upside as we track these customers over time. And if we do find a customer that only came in once, we can talk to them and if we have a customer that may have lapsed, we have a better way to communicate with them as well. The e-mails that we are getting today addresses from our customers will add tremendous value in the long-haul. Chuck Grom : Thanks very much. Operator : And next, we will go to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi good morning. Kurt, very nice quarter. So congratulations first. Kurt Barton : Thank you. Brian Nagel : The other question, I want \u2013 I think that prior question may have touched on as well, but the question I have is we talk how we call it your stock now for many years, with a topic weather comes up a lot. And if I look at this quarter very solid 5% comp in a period where I don\u2019t think weather was all that cooperative, because I think weather was essentially I mean I think this was another year where maybe winter stuck around longer than it should have that type of thing, you didn\u2019t have in Q1 the real break to spring we knew, we had it now, so subsequent to Q1. But so the question I have is I mean guess first my assessment is correct, but bigger, is something changing, obviously you are doing much more of the systems now and is Tractor now becoming better equipped so to say that deal with these potential weather issues that we see back during the first quarter? Steve Barbarick : Yes. I think that there is \u2013 I think there is a maturation of us as an organization using systems and technology that will help diffuse some of the weather impact. But if you look at the quarter, we did see benefit from spring like products. We saw some benefit from cold related products. But I will tell you we saw very strong sales of our core business or what we call year around products. All three work in concert, all areas and regions of the country were positive and all product divisions saw positive comps. So it\u2019s hard to pick any specific thing out Brian, but I would tell you that as we mature as an organization our supply chain becomes nimble. We have got systems to support what we are doing and the capabilities that we have invested in. I think we are starting to see the results of a lot of those investments. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s helpful. And then the second follow-up question I have the way the topics stick with Mary Winn\u2019s rule, the flooding that occurred in the Mid-west particularly in the states like Nebraska and Iowa, how do you think about that in terms of either the impact in Q1 going forward may have a factor for your business as we look for 2019? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve again. When we look at the data we don\u2019t see any material impact from those stores on the district, the region, the geography anything specific jumps out, I think from a more macro perspective it will be interesting to see what happens with corn yields and soybeans just because that impacts possible inflation, it doesn\u2019t impact our sales specifically because our consumer is not production, but it is probably a macro thing than anything else. So we don\u2019t necessarily see those floods as having any material impact at this point on our business. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thanks. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks guys. Good morning and great quarter. I wanted to just follow-up on the guidance for margins this year and the cadence that you have talked about in the past, so it sounds like second half will be better than the first half, now obviously the first quarter came in better than expected, at the same time you are also shifting some store openings into the back half, it sounded like, so does that change your view on the cadence at all as we think about how the year should play out? Kurt Barton : Seth this is Kurt. In regards to the store shifting a bit, it will not have a material impact on the cadence of the operating margin. But to the first part of your question on operating margin and the cadence of it, still in line with our initial guide. And I will just remind you that we do anticipate second half to have operating margin performance stronger than the first half. And there is really three key contributors to that. The Frankfort distribution center ramp up more negatively impacting the first half of the year than the second half. And in the second half while it still has on SG&A some de-leverage impact as modest as that is, you will begin to have some offset of that on the transportation side on the distribution center. Secondly on the back half we really don\u2019t start to cycle most of the step up in some of our higher costs last year transportation or wages until about mid-year. So it gives the better compare in the second half of the year. And then third, our profit improvement plan initiatives that we have been strategically working on we are in that implementation stage right now and not at the point of seeing a lot of benefits from it, but we continue to believe we get offset in benefits starting in the second half of the year on the profit improvement plan initiatives. Those key factors really give us a better opportunity for the strength of the operating margin and the flow through in the back half of the year. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks Kurt for that and I appreciate that. Maybe just one follow-up that\u2019s really the incentive comp in the quarter was higher, are you guys able to quantify that and then for the full year you kept the guidance, so should we assume that if you hit those numbers incentive comp is neutral for the year or is it a headwind, can you just remind us how that plays out and what\u2019s factored into the guidance? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes. Sure. The incentive compensation was less of a factor in the level of its impact compared to the non-recurring distribution center cost. Slightly below that the important thing is that its level of impact on the quarter was less than we saw impact on Q3 and Q4 last year. So it begins to moderate as we have easier compares. And if we hit our guidance for the year which should be in line with our plan for the year incentive compensation would not be a de-leverage point for 2019. Seth Sigman : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matt McClintock : Hi yes, good morning everyone and also congratulations. I was wondering two quick questions, first one just is a follow-up on the commodity costs, you kind of give us an overview of where they may go given the flooding, but I was just wondering because there is such divergent in commodity cost pressures right now, you have oil going one direction, crop prices going in other, if you can just give us an overview of how you are thinking about that impacting your business over the course of the year? Thanks. Greg Sandfort : Matt, let me start with that one. I don\u2019t mean to scare anybody, but about the floods of North I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with that. I am just saying that from a macro perspective we just got to keep an eye on it, that\u2019s all I would say there. Relative to inflation for the quarter and for this year, what we saw basically in the first quarter was in line with expectations and really was a carry over from what I would say was the second half of last year. So that\u2019s kind of where we are at and that\u2019s what I would say that we would expect going forward for the remainder of this year. And what we are seeing it is, we are seeing a little bit in some gains and we are also seeing a little bit in some steel products. Our lubricant business isn\u2019t significant, but there is a moderate \u2013 modest impact there. Matt McClintock : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And another follow-up to Michael\u2019s question in terms of comp acceleration potential or just comp stream going forward, I think Greg started up by talking about seven straight quarters of above 3% comps and the trend it self has been building, it\u2019s been going up and that\u2019s a great direction to be, but I was just wondering because of that how should we think about that going forward, clearly your initiatives are playing out, clearly they are driving stronger comps, what inning would you say are we in and some of these initiatives playing out in terms of that acceleration meaning 5 today could be a 6 tomorrow or 7 tomorrow, should we just think in kind of leveling off here going forward? Thanks. Greg Sandfort : Yes. This is Greg. Here is what I would tell you. First of all, the ONETractor strategy and the components of that have been talked about here most of the morning. And they are all in different stages of what I would call maturity, nothing is anywhere near maturity. As Kurt mentioned in a couple of his comments, the PIP program, the profit improvement is just starting to really get embedded. So there is a lot of headroom in front of us for these things. So what we would caution you always in our business we have been in this business now a little over 11 years. Steve has been here over 20 years. Kurt has been here 17 years plus. You can see that is really a half in game. You have got to look at the business on halves and you got to look at these components of initiatives and such probably gaining more momentum as we get towards the second half and that\u2019s basically what we put into our guidance. That\u2019s what we felt that way initially. But it\u2019s a half game, it\u2019s not a quarter game. We are very pleased with Q1. We believe that we have got ammunition to carry forward. But I wouldn\u2019t tell you that there is any one thing today that is I can highlight. I would say that what we are fortunate to have is a number of things in the basket that are working all-in units. And as Steve said earlier, they are all moving the business forward. The opportunity to drive greater comps and we have seen is there, but it\u2019s too early in this year to start call that. Matt McClintock : Great. Thanks Greg and everyone else best of luck. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : Next we will go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys, Scot Ciccarelli. So I have two very specific questions on the private label credit program. First of all, of the people that are using Tractor Supply\u2019s credit card, what percent of those transactions are people actually taking advantage of your deferred financing. And then second, what percent of tender is now coming from the private label tender? Kurt Barton : Scott this is Kurt, I will start with the second question. What we have said is that when we re-launch this program historically we maintains at a low single-digit percentage of tender. And with still yet a year under our belt it\u2019s still very early. But with the double digit growth that we have seen year-over-year, we are making good progress on being able to move outside of that low single digit mark on the penetration from the card. It\u2019s right in line with our expectations. And I will just add to it I will plan to give a little bit more detail at the investor community day coming up in May on our targets for that and some of the initiatives we have as well. As early as it is right now, I don\u2019t have the data nor we are really sharing a lot of the specifics on what the customers are spending in particular on big ticket versus just non-big ticket item, how much they are taking deferred financing. But in general, I would say we have seen growth in both deferred financing as well as the standard financing on the program. And we have seen a real solid momentum and strength from that deferred financing that\u2019s pushing the growth in the program. So in general, the growth certainly is correlated with the resonation with our customers accepting the deferred financing and the program is exactly where we would want that to be. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. So in other words, the reason that the tender has increased as dramatically as it has is because of the deferred financing offers? Greg Sandfort : It\u2019s one of the key contributors. That\u2019s a big part of it. Just don\u2019t want to understate we would like the fact that we are able to grow in standard financing as well being repeat visits and buying on the card outside of the big ticket deferred financing. Scot Ciccarelli : Alright. Thanks guys. Greg Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zach Fadem : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking me in. Could you talk a little more about the personalization technology, you said you are implementing for Neighbor\u2019s Club, you mentioned more targeted promotions as an opportunity, but how does the new technology come into play here and to what extend are you actually utilizing data to drive incremental sales today? Steve Barbarick : Sure. This is Steve. I mean basically we have some machine learning AI type of technology that will allow us to go in and set parameters. Say we will take key product categories, key SKUs, good to understand who is buying them, understanding their e-mail address through their Neighbor\u2019s Club program and then be able to take that large amount of data with the guidelines parameters that we put in and personalize the communication directly to them not just through test but also through the inventory. And see that\u2019s where the value of this really comes in. So rather than trying to do the linked e-mails, we are just grouping some e-mails. We are able to now get to that as I mentioned earlier 4,000 versions in triggered e-mail out to specific customers. That\u2019s how the system will work and we can continue to refine and better improve the e-mail communication out over time as we continue to get more and more data, click rates and responses from these customers. Zach Fadem : Got it. And then quickly on the profit improvement plan, could you just talk about the evolution of the benefits particularly this year like what\u2019s on deck for the second half in terms of store or DC productivity benefits and then how do you expect this to evolve with indirect spend and all the other items in the out years? Kurt Barton : Yes. Sure. Zach this is Kurt. As I have said we are on track with it. The first thing I would say is it\u2019s important to know that from the \u2013 our strategy on the profit improvement plan is about process re-engineering, performance management and benefiting and leveraging automation. And I would point that out to contrast against just a cost cutting initiative because our focus is on sustainable efficiencies in the process. We are launching in-store productivity. It\u2019s now in test in 100 plus stores on a lot of the process re-engineering. We are in pilot on with re-engineering in labor management standards and efficiencies at one distribution center and we are fairly well along on the transportation side of optimizing lanes and driving efficiency in reduction in costs \u2013 carrier costs which we believe will start to flow through on the back half of the year. So like the ability to go after long-term sustainable, we are making good progress on the program. Zach Fadem : Got it. Helpful color. Appreciate the time. Kurt Barton : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : David, I think we have hit the top of the hour. So I think we can close out the call, mail and thanks to everyone joining the call. Marry Ann and I will be around if you have any questions. We look forward to talking to you on our second quarter call in July. More importantly, we will be hosting our Investment Community Day on March 15 here in Nashville. I hope you can join us. Thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply and have a great day. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s Tractor Supply Company\u2019s conference call to discuss first quarter 2019 results. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. Overall Tractor Supply had a very solid second quarter which allowed for a strong first half performance for the Company. Our second quarter results were driven by sales strength across all geographic regions as well as both in comparable average ticket and traffic. We saw broad-based strength across our merchandising categories with notable strength in our core year-round categories and solid sales growth in our spring and summer assortments. Our second quarter results represent the eighth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales above 3%. And during the quarter the Tractor Supply team was very nimble across store operations, merchandising and our supply chain, which enabled us to capitalize on the shifting consumer demand for products across the many markets that we serve. At the same time, we were in stock for our customers for their everyday basic assortments that we know our customers rely on us to have, so that they can continue to live the out here lifestyle. Now that we are halfway \u2013 at the halfway mark of the year, we are updating our outlook for the full-year. And as we enter the third quarter we believe our merchandising and marketing initiatives accompany with our ONETractor strategy initiatives have us well positioned to drive our business for the second half of the year. Now let me touch on a few highlights from the second quarter as compared to the second quarter a year-ago. We delivered a strong comparable store sales increase of 3.2% in the second quarter with comp average ticket increasing 2.2% and transactions growing at 1% in the quarter. This marks over a decade of annual positive traffic growth. Net sales plus 6.3% to $2.4 billion for the quarter, as we continued our strategy to open new stores at both Tractor Supply and Petsense. Diluted EPS was a $1.80 and increase of 6.5% and year-to-date we have returned $414 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. During the second quarter as a demonstration of our confidence in our business, our board increased our dividend by 12.9%. This marks the ninth consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, our share repurchase authorization was increased by $1.5 billion. As we remain committed to maintaining a discipline capital allocation strategy to create long-term value for our shareholders and based upon our performance year-to-date, we are raising the low end of our full-year earnings guidance by $0.05, bringing our new range to $4.65 to $4.75 per share. Now let's review several of the operational highlights for the second quarter. We opened 15 new Tractor Supply stores and two Petsense locations. Our newest distribution center in Frankfort, New York received LEED Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council reinforcing our commitment to sustainable business practices. Our GURA and High Five Programs, which are part of our unique selling process for our store teams continue to drive sales to legendary customer service. This quarter, we continued strong double-digit sales growth in our e-commerce business and during the second quarter, we continued to experience solid growth with our Buy Online Pickup in Store program programs. Our customers appreciate the relevance of our stores in the rural community and between the combination of our Buy Online Pickup in Store and direct delivery to stores, greater than 70% of our e-commerce orders are being fulfilled at our stores. This continues to illustrate the importance of our store assets and their key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business and more importantly, this is a very cost effective way to fulfill our customer's orders for the products that they need with greater speed and efficiency. We believe that our capabilities of Buy Online Pickup in Store, mobile point-of-sale, Neighbor's Club and Stockyard ordering position us uniquely to serve this customer base better than anyone else in this highly fragmented market and we see significant opportunities to broaden our customer reach and increase our market share as our store base and digital capabilities mature over time. As we've said, our ONETractor strategy remains focused on four objectives, driving profitable growth, building customer centric engagement, offering the most relevant products and services and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We are building solid momentum behind our ONETractor strategy that serves our customers anytime, anywhere, in any way they choose. And I believe our ONETractor strategy positions us to meet the unique preferences that our customers have for demand driven immediate need products in an easy and seamless shopping experience. We also believe that to continue convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and the updates to our in-store and online shopping experiences are not only resonating with our customers, but they are defensible. It is an exciting time for Tractor Supply and as we grow larger, we believe we have developed superior capabilities to better serve the Out Here lifestyle customer. Now let me turn the call over to Steve. Steve Barbarick : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to take a moment this morning to give you a brief update on product performance during the quarter. The progress we're making on building out our capabilities and look forward to the second half of the year. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter, we had a solid comp store sales performance driven by both average ticket as well as continued increases in traffic. The team was nimble and well-prepared to capitalize on the spring selling season with a great lineup of merchandise in our stores as well as online. Our strong average ticket growth of 2.2% was positively impacted by several factors including product mix and overall retail price management. We were able to capitalize on seasonal trends during the quarter. Our updated assortment of outdoor power equipment produced positive results. Tractor Supply continues to be a shopping destination for this important category. Turning to traffic. We've benefited from consistent performance and our everyday merchandise, otherwise known as consumable, usable and edible or CUE products. During the quarter, we were pleased with our sales dollars and unit growth across these consumable categories. For example, we experienced strength in product lines such as pet food and supplies, animal feed, live goods, grass seed and forge to name a few. As a company, our mission is to be a dependable supplier of basic maintenance products and it\u2019s these products that drive repeat traffic to our stores. Turning to big-ticket sales. We had strengthened zero turn mowers, welders, and three-point equipment. Given the seasonal trends in the second quarter, especially in the Northeast and Midwest, we did experience some softness in our front engine molders, cooling products as well as trailers. We were lapping significant big-ticket growth in the second quarter of last year and as a result, our big-ticket sales were down slightly. Lastly, we were pleased that all major product categories delivered positive comp store sales in the second quarter. Our supply chain did an excellent job staying nimble and managing to the needs of the business. Our ability to capitalize on geographic weather trends as a core competency and strength of Tractor Supply. Now let me turn to the progress we are making on building out our capabilities. Consistent with what we communicated at our May Investment Community Day; we continue to be pleased with the traction we are gaining with our key initiatives. Specific examples include capabilities, such as growing our Neighbors' Club engagement, the chain wide rollout of our Stockyard kiosk and mobile point-of-sale technology, enhancing our Tractor Supply credit card offering and investments in our supply chain. As part of our ONETractor Supply, we are auctioning the rich customer data we're receiving from our loyalty program. The data allows us to target specific customer groups based on their frequency and category specific spending. This personalized approach is allowing us to drive engagement and build share of wallet over time. By using our customer data to identify people who shop in specific categories, we're able to target potential new customers and social channels. We then use targeted messaging to these customers because our modeling gives us confidence that they are more likely to purchase in whatever category that we're targeting. This year spring marketing campaign for power equipment was a great example of how we're leveraging our data. We knew we wanted to make a bold statement about our great lineup for power equipment. Our goal was to stay top of mind with our current customers who were in the outdoor power equipment market while also introducing the Tractor Supply brand to new look alike customers. The team created a series of videos featuring brands such as Bad Boy, Cub Cadet and Husqvarna to ensure customers knew that we carry these brands. We then use machine learning to digitally market these videos across multiple online sites to existing customers and potential new customers that had an affinity toward the outdoor power equipment business. With geo targeted these ads around each of our stores. These videos reviewed over 8 million times and linked to more than 300,000 store visits. These are significant and measurable results and we were able to unlock the power of our customer data and be highly efficient with our digital marketing campaigns. Our Neighbor's Club membership growth continues to be a transformational and growing asset to drive brand loyalty with the one-year retention rate at nearly 90% our customer feedback continues to be overwhelmingly positive. The use of Neighbor's Club data to drive sales by improving customer targeting and personalization continues to evolve based on customer insights. Using our new campaign management tool, thousands of versions of each campaign are being deployed as compared to a limited manual process in the past. As a result of more relevant messaging, our personalized campaigns are outperforming the control group. The rollout of our Stockyard kiosks will allow us to provide even more customers with the long tail product assortment as we have well over a 100,000 SKUs on our website. At the store level, the Stockyard kiosks are a proven tool for driving incremental sales. The rollout of these kiosks along with the expansion of mobile point-of-sale technology is anticipated to be completed by the end of the third quarter. The Tractor Supply credit card offering supports our ONETractor strategy by driving sales and building loyalty. We have seen the use of our private label credit card increase across the board as a result of more compelling financing offers. We know that our credit card customers visit our stores more frequently and have a higher average spend. Starting in the fourth quarter of this year, cardholders will be able to earn $5 and Neighbor's Club rewards for every $100 they spend on the card. Essentially a 5% reward. This compares to $5 for every $150 under the existing program. Over time, we anticipate that this will become a key tool in deepening our relationship with our customers, drive loyalty and increase our share of wallet. Let me now briefly highlight a few merchandising initiatives we have for the back half of this year. To build on our portfolio of exclusive brands. Next month we will be introducing a new workwear line called RIDGECUT. We recognize that we have an opportunity to close the gap in our assortment in the workwear category. The brand standards we compared RIDGECUT II includes [ZuluTrade], Filson and Carhartt. The Ridge Cut product line is designed for exceptional quality and durability with a great value proposition. The product line will retail at 20% to 30% less than the national brands. We are very excited about this brand launches we transition into the fall season. We have two additional brands we'll be launching in third quarter. First up is our partnership with Miranda Lambert\u2019s MuttNation Foundation. We will offer an exclusive assortment of branded dog beds, toys, and supplies. To kick off this partnership, we will be hosting a nationwide pet adoption in our stores as a part of our monthlong out here with animal celebration. This event aligns perfectly with MuttNation mission to promote and facilitate the adoption of shelter pets. Just in time for deer season, we'll be launching the Catchin' Deers brand of apparel. This is a fun lifestyle brand for our hunters with a sense of humor. We're the first to partner with this brand that was Co-Founded by Mike Fisher, a former hockey player. Our product assortment will be exclusive to Tractor Supply. We talked a lot about the importance of Retail Theater and during the third quarter in addition to our monthlong Out Here with Animals campaign. We will also be having our Fall Chick Days event across the vast majority of the chain. To wrap up, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customer's need and the second half of the year with our in-store and online product offerings complimented with our store engagement initiatives all supported by a nimble supply chain. I will now turn the call over to Kirk. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered a very balanced quarter that came in much in line with our expectations. For the second quarter of 2019 we had solid comp store sales growth of 3.2%. April and June were the strongest months of the quarter. With moisture levels and cooler conditions impacting our performance in May and to a lesser extent the early part of June in select markets. Petsense stores continue to have positive comp store sales increases in line with our chain average. For the second quarter, gross profit dollars increased 6.7% to $820.7 million. Gross margin improved by 11 basis points to 34.9%. The increased resulted principally from product mix and effective price management initiatives. Our merchandising and pricing teams did an excellent job both planning for and reacting to the shifting timeline relating to tariffs. In addition, for the first time in a few years, freight headwinds moderated and along with the favorable impact of our efficiency initiatives. Freight costs were essentially neutral year-over-year. Including depreciation and amortization SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 24 basis points to 22.7%. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to incremental costs associated with the new distribution center in Frankfort, New York, and to a lesser extent investment in team member wages. Partially offsetting these increases were leverage and occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Specific to our Frankfort distribution center we estimate that about 20 basis points of our SG&A increase as a percentage of sales is attributable to the ramp up of the DC in the second quarter. As the distribution center increases the number of stores it serves in the back half of the year. We anticipate deleverage to be slightly less in the back half. Excluding the impact of DC ramp up, we had good underlying SG&A performance. For the quarter our effective tax rate was 22.4% as we received incremental non-recurring tax benefits from share-based compensation. Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet and we continue our track record of generating robust cash flows from operations. At quarter end, our merchandise inventories were $1.73 billion, an increase of 3.5% on a per store basis from the 2018 second quarter. The increase is principally due to inflation, inclusive of the impact of tariffs as well as growth and fast-turning CUE merchandise to support the positive trends in the business. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we're very comfortable with its quality. As we enter the second half of the year, we are well positioned to take advantage of the change of the seasons. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends while maintaining a discipline approach to capital allocation. Thought the first half of the year, we repurchased about 3.5 million shares of our common stock for $334.2 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $79.7 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of our common stock. With the increased share repurchase authorization from our Board in May, our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $1.7 billion as of the quarter end. Let's now turn to our guidance. Given our performance year-to-date, we are updating our financial outlook for 2019. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.46 billion, an increase of 6% to 7% over fiscal 2018, comparable store sales in the range of 3% to 4%; operating margin rate of 8.9% to 9%; net income in the range of $562 million to $575 million and earnings per diluted share of $4.65 to $4.75, compared to our previous guidance of $4.60 to $4.75 per diluted share. We continue to forecast our annual effective tax rates to be in the range of 22.4% to 22.7% and our capital spending in the range of $225 million to $250 million for the year. While the timing of our new store openings is behind our original forecast, we continue to anticipate opening about 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 new Petsense stores. The shift in timing of new store openings does have a modest unfavorable impact on the topline sales as well as operating profits. This has been factored into our revised guidance for the year. We have taken steps to correct the executional issues impacting this timing. We continue to believe that our real estate model is a core strength of Tractor Supply and our pipeline for new stores in 2020 is healthy. Our profit improvement plan work streams which are focused on driving supply chain efficiencies, store productivity and indirect procurement savings remain on track and we are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities all on a sustainable basis. Our profit improvement plan is designed to help mitigate cost pressures and enhance our ability to reinvest back in the business over time. As you model the remainder of the year, please keep in mind key factors to the cadence of our profitability growth. We continue to anticipate operating profit performance and earnings growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. We are forecasting that our effective tax rate will be higher in the second half of the year as we don't anticipate that the discrete tax benefit from stock-based compensation in the first half of the year will occur at the same rate. Also recall that we're lapping an estimated 40 basis point benefit to comp sales growth from hurricanes in both the third and fourth quarter of 2018. To wrap up, the first half of the year was strong. The momentum in the business is solid and we're executing robust plans to continue to build the business for the long-term. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Kurt. And in closing, I'd like to thank the nearly 30,000 team members across our entire organization for their commitment to our mission and values and their focus on delivering a great experience every day to our Out Here lifestyle customers. Their passion for living our culture is a competitive advantage for us. And while we've had a strong first half, we know we have much work to do to finish this year. As a team, we are energized about our business and look forward to talking to you again later this year regarding our third quarter results. And with that, Mary Winn, we now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right, Greg. We can poll for questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first from JPMorgan, we have Chris Horvers. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, question for you, as you think about the weather in the second quarter, do you think it was a headwind in the quarter? I mean, we know we had a sort of a tough compare in May, but April was easier on the spring front. So, do you think it was a headwind and could you quantify that? And then as you look ahead and just looking at the map, soil moisture levels are very high in many of your markets. You've had that sort of recent heat wave. So, do you think you'll have this extended spring season like you saw a few years ago? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Chris, this is Steve. I guess I would put it this way. I mean we're always navigating between year-over-year what's normal, what's not normal. When I look at the totality of the business, Greg mentioned that we had sprint in spring seasonal businesses that were positive for the quarter. I believe I mentioned it as well. What I would also say is when you look into Q3 because we're already several weeks into the Q3 for us right now. It's in line with what our expectations have been. And so last thing I would mention is, our inventory is in good position to take advantage of any extended summer selling season we might have. And while at the same time, we are well prepared to take care of customers if we have an early cold weather business centers in the quarter. So that's kind of how I see it shaping up. We're a nimble company and we can react pretty quickly. Christopher Horvers : And then as a follow-up, as you think about the tariff, how has you seen pricing play out in the market? What have you done and into what extent that, how did that expect your guidance for the back half of the year versus your original expectation? Steve Barbarick : Yes. Let me start with that. Chris, this is Steve and then maybe Kurt, you can follow-up on that. So, we're a year into it, believe it or not. So, the first wave of tariffs that we originally were passed through. And for tractor, we're in a little bit of a unique position being a needs-based company, which really serves us well at a time like this. Over the years, we've made some key investments and some pricing tools, whether they be webscraping that then feed into our pricing tool and allows us to know what's going on out there across the wide spectrum and manage our pricing accordingly. As you're well aware, our businesses hold up nicely in the past several quarters. And if you look at the business, I mean it's working well within the four walls of the box as well as geographically. So, we feel like our customers are in a pretty healthy position right now. And then the last thing I would say is we feel, we're well prepared to manage the general uncertainties of these tariffs going forward. Kurt? Kurt Barton : Yes. And Chris, I'd add to that, and I\u2019d just tag on to what Steve said at the end. One of the things we factored in and to the back half guidance is, just an overall consideration of the back half of the year. This is the time where the consumer, if you think from a macro standpoint, this is the back half where the consumer is going to have all of the impact of these first three layers of tariffs. And we felt it was prudent to make sure an overarching consideration was what does that do to the consumers spend and how will they adjust to all-in tariffs. And I would just say from a broad overarching theme, we had that as a key consideration when we designed the updated guidance for the year. Christopher Horvers : So, does that mean that some price a little less, but some volume headwind and a little bit of gross margin tucked in there, too? Headwind as well? Kurt Barton : Well, we were just aware that those are all factors whether they all go in that same direction, but those are adjustments or variables that could happen with a back half that's got some level of uncertainty. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Best of luck in the back half. Kurt Barton : Thank you. Operator : And next from Evercore ISI, we have Oliver Wintermantel. Oliver Wintermantel : Yes. Good morning, guys. My question was, you mentioned the delay in the new store openings at this year. Could you give us a little bit more details what was driving that? Kurt Barton : Yes, Oliver. This is Kurt. I'd summarize it pretty simple. We pride ourselves on consistent execution and execution in this area includes adequately covering for the inherent risks and construction and opening stores. This year we didn't execute well on coverage for those inherent risks. And it shifted the time of new stores a bet. We've addressed the issue. This is specific to this year. The existing pipeline is strong and as I said, we continue to expect to hit our target goal of 80 stores this year. And continue to have confidence in our ability to open stores timely in 2020 with a robust pipeline of future sites in progress at this point. Oliver Wintermantel : Got it. Thank you. And just for the back end of the year. If you look at the first half, right, I see your comp ticket was certainly a lot stronger than your comp transactions. I mean both positive, which is great, but the ticket was stronger. How do you expect that playing out in the second half of the year? Are we \u2013 is ticket's going to go fast and traffic or do you see that a reversing? Thank you. Kurt Barton : First, I'd say each quarter can be different, but in general our assumption is that with the cost pressures, it may be very similar in directionally in the back half of the year as you saw in the first half. Oliver Wintermantel : Got it. Thanks very much. And good luck. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I could just follow-up on the tariff question posed earlier. I wondered if you could talk through - just in terms of how successful you were at mitigating, I guess some of the headwinds, some tariffs, especially in light with some of the products on List 1 through 3 going from 10% earlier this year to 25% starting in June? Steve Barbarick : Sure. Kate, this is Steve. For the quarter, I believe we've showed that we were able to manage through that climate pretty well, margin rates, as Kurt mentioned we're positive and so the tools and technology we have today are really allowing us to use science to manage our business. And thus far we've managed it pretty well and we feel like going into the back half, we've got a plan to mitigate whatever those tariffs maybe. Understand one last thing here and that is that we have built up a very large consumable side of our business over the years. And so, the tariffs don't have probably as significant of impact on Tractor Supply as other retailers that are out there. And that's a benefit to us as we move forward. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. And if I could just follow-up on a ticket, it seemed like it was a little bit lower than it's been in the last few quarters. I know you mentioned some big tickets softness in the quarter. I just wondered if you could talk to us about how you think about big ticket for the rest of the year and how it influences overall ticket at the company? Steve Barbarick : Yes, this is Steve again, Kate. What I would say is in the quarter we were up against some very strong big tickets sales from a year-ago. And as I went down the longer list of \u2013 some of the weather trends or seasonal trends that we experienced in the quarter. Big ticket things like cooling and trailers, some front engine riders, tillers, they were all soft for us. And I think that had probably an overarching impact for the first half and certainly in the quarter there. As we move forward, every quarter is a little different. Whether it has or those seasonal trends have a bit of a different impact on us. So, I suspect that as we get into this and we're able to use our private label credit card with the new offering, as I mentioned, the $5 for 100 spend. I think that we may see a shift backwards and we should hopefully see some improvement on big ticket. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Next from Piper Jaffray we have Peter Keith. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a good first half of the year. I want to dig into both up the private label and the direct sourcing as percent of sales. So those are trending down year-on-year in the second quarter. Curious if you could address that of it's more of a seasonal dynamic if you're starting to see some impact from tariffs and certainly, I don't expect your Cap, Tap, but maybe address if you think that that direction can be reversed? Gregory Sandfort : Peter, I will tell you that, we still have an emphasis around growing exclusive brands. But at the same time, and you may have heard me say this before, we are a branded house that offers exclusive brand as well. And the team has done a really nice job, working with the folks like Carhartt, Scotts and others to build out a broader portfolio of some of those strong national brands. And we're seeing strength in those businesses. So, while we've seen a slight decline in percentage of sales that wouldn't necessarily suggest that, it's a concern because we're growing the whole pie. And so, the team is still focused on that. We've talked about RIDGECUT launching here shortly in some other categories. So that's not a real concern of mine. In terms of direct sourcing, there's ebbs and flows to that. Some of its receipt timing et cetera. So that's not a concern either. Peter Keith : Okay. Thank you for that. Maybe, I guess a little bit different topic. We heard some rumblings about rising inflationary pressures. I think it's a little bit of a tariff related, but also commodity related. Maybe Kurt, could you give us your update on the inflation trends, looking at to the back half and then relate to that with the multi-year highs in corn prices. When do you think some of that impact could start to show up in your results? Kurt Barton : Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. We often in the quarters, we'll give you some indication on commodity level inflation and as we've been seeing in the past few quarters, some modest level of commodity inflation, Q2 saw that as well. We did continue to see some level of impact. We'd estimate around 50 basis points of commodity level inflation on the cost as well as the topline average ticket. And there's a number of variables in there and we would say based on our estimates to [wherever] we can see. We'd anticipate the back half to probably stay similar to that range of commodity level impact on the inflation factor. Peter Keith : And how about on \u2013 do you think corn prices will eventually speak in to those numbers as we look out to next year? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve. It's very interesting. I'm not really sure. Right now, we do see an increase in grains, mainly corn. It depends on how the harvest goes. I mean if yields come out higher than what was expected, you will see corn prices declined. And so, we're keeping close tabs on that now working with our suppliers. It's too hard to gauge. I guess we'll probably know here in a couple of months once they get into the fields. Peter Keith : Okay, sounds good. Thanks a lot guys and good luck. Steve Barbarick : Thank you. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And we have Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter \u2013 guys. Gregory Sandfort : Good morning. Steve Barbarick : Thanks, Simeon. Simeon Gutman : My first question is, on the full-year margin guide. I think it's flat to up 10 bps or so. And to get to the midpoint, I think its average is about 25 bps of positive in the second half. Does that spread evenly across Q3 and Q4? Gregory Sandfort : I'd say the way we factor \u2013 this fourth quarter has more potential for the margin expansion in the Q3. But our guidance is that overall throughout the second half that we anticipate that with some SG&A deleverage at a lesser extent and gross margins modestly improving that we've got good upside throughout the back half. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up, I guess related is on freight. You mentioned it was I guess a little bit better than you expected. I think \u2013 I don't think it was supposed to really taper until the second half. So, what's causing that? Is it just spot rates, which have come in or it's something about your process getting better and then does that mean it's an incremental positive or good guy to the back half? Now that it's become a positive a little sooner? Kurt Barton : Sure. This is Kurt, Simeon. In regards to the performance in Q2, it's a mixture of both things that we're controlling as well as more the macro and on a macro standpoint it's, it's a bit more than just spot rates. There is an improvement over all that we see in the capacity. The average carrier rates are moderating and we've done a great job with our initiatives of renegotiations in the process as well as controlling the use of spot rates. The things that we've done to reduce the stem miles and increase the capacity or the amount of value in the loads have also benefited. And those are some of the things that we're real proud of the transportation team to jump on and address that ahead of our schedule and that benefited second quarter. Our anticipation though was those types of benefits would start to hit in Q3 and Q4, so no real change to our expectation in the back half from transportation. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : And next we have Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Gregory Sandfort : Hey Dan. Daniel Imbro : I had a few questions on some of your geographic exposure in different markets. I guess first kind of starting on your more ag exposed markets, given the delay we saw on the planting season, our sense from the industry was that many of those markets could end up facing actual headwinds this year despite the spike in commodity prices. Have you seen those markets soften at all? Or what are some of your more ag exposed markets looking like through the second quarter given the rain? Gregory Sandfort : Hey, Daniel. This is Greg. Let me address that one. If you have done the study of our business and the farm store business, you will know that most of these ag markets are in the upper Midwest of the country. There's some in northern California, but primarily upper Midwest. Those areas from a seasonal trend\u2019s standpoint had been softer due to tremendous amounts of moisture, and probably I would say a little bit more on the basis of elongated cool weather. And we anticipated that. And as the weather is now drying and as weather is warming, we're seeing those areas of the country come back into the normal, we'll call it normal performance of the business. But remember, we're not directly ag related. A large production farming operations are not really who we address. We address the more called a casual, individual who has some properties, some land, and probably has a two or three acre garden. It's not the production side. So yes, we'll fill a little bit of that drag in those markets. But to be very honest with you as the weather is warmed and things have improved from a condition of moisture, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in the business. Daniel Imbro : Great. That's helpful. And then just on a similar related topic, moving geographies, thinking about the energy markets, obviously crude volatile year-to-date, but how consistent have those markets held up? Obviously, the last cycle seems a little bit different than this one, but just yet, we'd love an update on those. Thanks. Gregory Sandfort : Well, this is Greg again. It's quite a bit different than the last cycle. But here is what I would tell you that there's been some modest level of commodity inflation, but not great. Steve mentioned about our retail price management programs, which helps us to make sure that we're pricing accordingly. We're not seeing any current waning in the oil markets. The rig counts and employments seem to be stable and oil is running around $60 a barrel. So really not a major consideration. It's more moderate today than it's ever been. I think the oil companies had a great learning a few years ago from what they experienced. And so geographically, it is somewhat limited now to say, I would say the Western Texas corridor. So, I think we're feeling pretty good about what we see and the performance of the business in those markets. Daniel Imbro : Great. Best of luck guys. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you. Operator : And from Credit Suisse, we have Seth Sigman. Seth Sigman : Hey guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the guidance and the implications for the second quarter. So, I think you had talked about Q1 coming in better than you expected. It sounds like Q2 is about in line. I'm just curious, maybe just to clarify, have you made any changes to your assumptions for the back half of the year? I know you made that comment about the delayed openings, wasn't sure if that implied maybe lower growth in the back half than you were expecting previously. If you could just clarify that, that would be helpful. Kurt Barton : Yes. Seth, this is Kurt. In regards, as your question is a little bit about how do we frame up the guidance in the back half, and I\u2019d start by saying from an overarching view, our guidance reflects the belief in the strength of the business and not only the first half strength, but also what we expect for the back half. And I think it's demonstrated Best Buy; our updated guidance has an annual 3% to 4% comp rate for the year. But when considering the back half and the updated guidance, it reflects really three things. First, a solid performance in the first half as you mentioned with some upside results that we factored in particularly related to Q1. The second thing is on the back half as I mentioned, we did factor in the impact not only the topline, but the bottom line for the timing shifts on new stores as well as the shift on the income tax rate. Whereas I mentioned, we believe some of that discrete benefit shifted into the first half of the year out of the first \u2013 out of the second half and drives a higher tax rate in the second half. And those two factors do impact our expectation on the bottom line for the back half of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, the third thing, certainly a level of consideration for the macro issue that the consumer may be facing as they adjust to an all in tariffs. Wrapping it all up. The back half is very much in line with our original expectation with the adjustment for those two items that I mentioned and consistent, performance, evidence with the strength of the business, the first half continuing into the second half. Seth Sigman : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just to follow-up here. The bridge to the second half margin improvement with your guiding here. Can you just talk about some of the areas where you are making progress and driving operating efficiencies and then we talked a little bit about transportation already? First quarter and second quarter you had really good underlying SG&A performance. Can you maybe help isolate some of the buckets where you're making progress and also what is expected to ramp as we move through the year to deliver that better flow through? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Sure. On the gross margin side, the assumptions are simply the strength of the merchandising team been able to manage through these varying costs with improving year-over-year freight costs. As you move to the SG&A area, we anticipate, as I said earlier that the new distribution center will have a less of a deleverage impact in the back half than it did the first half. And we're also recognizing we're facing some cost compares last year that we don't believe we'll repeat at the same level. Lastly, the profit improvement initiatives are showing some traction we're receiving and anticipating some benefits, particularly in areas of occupancy where some of the indirect procurement and managing the costs and things we can control are driving some benefit and those are things that we're putting in place and laying the foundation over the last six to nine months. Seth Sigman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Operator : And next we have Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. Steven Forbes : Good morning. I want to start with the 2019 class of stores. Right. I know we're early here in and you mentioned the delay in openings, but the initial productivity that's far looks above trends. Maybe just comment on the outlook for this year's class as it pertains to the foot footprint, right new versus existing and then sales productivity outlook relative to the average. Kurt Barton : Yes. Steven, this is Kurt. I agree with you. We\u2019ve very excited proud of the new store productivity. The model continues to be a strength of our business and the real estate team does a fantastic job of identifying sites and utilizing the greater customer data that we've got to make sure we're opening a strong stores in the right locations. And we're pleased with new store productivity so far this year and we think 2019 will be a real strong class and it helps give us more confidence in the strength of the pipeline as well. In regards to the overall performance on topline. We don't anticipate from an average sales standpoint that really varies significantly different from the history. Particularly with what I showed and walked through at the Investor Community Day. It's just a strength in the level of not only ramp up, but the productivity of the new stores. Steven Forbes : Thank you. And then as a follow-up, right, if you think back to the Analyst Day, you specifically discuss various store productivity initiatives. Right, and I think we are sort of in a test phase with a lot of those back in May. So maybe updated us on the anticipated timing of the rollout of these strategies, right receiving et cetera. And what the learnings are thus far? Kurt Barton : Sure. This is Kurt again. We're right on track with our plans. As we mentioned back in May. And just as a reminder, our store productivity initiative included a lot of reengineering of process, particularly back office or inventory handling. And additionally, with some tools like mobility, scheduling tools. All of that gets packaged together and then introduced to the stores as they get trained and rolled out. And so, we're right on track with our plan to methodically go through the stores throughout the back half of the year with a target goal of completing the rollout by the end of the year. What that means is, it's factored into our guidance. There's not a lot of efficiency driven in the back half as we're rolling this out, but it puts us in a great position to be able to capitalize that in 2020 and beyond. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : And next we have Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hey, guys. Good morning, guys. Gregory Sandfort : Good morning, Chuck. Chuck Grom : Can you tell us a little more the gross margin puts and takes in the quarter? And I guess what factors were less of a tailwind in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And then how we should be framing out the third and fourth quarter? Kurt Barton : Yes. Chuck, this is Kurt. Our performance on the gross margin side was very much in line with our expectations. As we mentioned, it benefited both from product mix and price management, price management being the larger of those two teams did an excellent job as we mentioned, utilizing the pricing systems to manage the rising costs. But compared to Q1, we mentioned in Q1 that we benefited from some discreet opportunities, whether it be mixed or the pricing specific to coming out of the winter selling season and did a fantastic job of capturing sales at better marks. The second quarter was really a matter of just executing to the plan and driving good pricing along with the benefit of some product mix and not having headwinds from the freight side of it. We would anticipate that those are the primary factors in the back half of the year. Freight moving from neutral to targeting to having some benefit from that and then utilizing the expertise of the merchant team and the systems to drive some benefit from the pricing. Chuck Grom : Okay, great. And then just a bigger picture on the Neighbor's Club and I think the 12 million members you have today, as you map out the various customer lifecycles. I'm just curious like what you're learning and what it's taught you about how to better engage with both new and existing customers? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve. I would tell you that the system has really benefited us in a lot of ways. We're continuing to take the data, segment the data. We can look at frequency now. We can look yet cross sell, up sell. As I mentioned earlier, when we do a campaign now, that campaign is no longer manually managed and kind of paint brushed across a lot of customers. We can have thousands of different deployments of that exact campaign with different banner, ads and whatnot. So, as we dig deeper and deeper into the data, it's just a rich stream that's coming back out and it's becoming more actionable across the entire organization. Kurt even talked about the performance of new stores, a lot of the data now we're able to use across the organization. So, whether it be tapping into the lapsed customer that we haven't seen in several months, whether it be communicating and engaging a customer that we just onboarded, the treasure trove of data is going to benefit us go forward. Chuck Grom : Great. Thanks very much. Good luck. Operator : And next from Wells Fargo, we have Zach Fadem. Zachary Fadem : Hey, good morning. Gregory Sandfort : Good morning. Zachary Fadem : Could we talk about private label credit card impact in the quarter, just given the financing offers? Curious, how that's impacted ticket in your topline relative to last year? And then any color on the impact of new signups in the quarter versus existing cardholders would also be helpful? Kurt Barton : Zach, yes, this is Kurt. A great question and we're excited about what the private label credit card is doing and believe it is a driver of the business. All metrics continue to be showing solid growth in line with our expectation, what we targeted. We saw growth in tender in both big ticket and broadly across the store. So, we know its resonating helping us in an environment of rising costs to show a value-added. The level of applications in new signups continue to be strong double-digit growth and helping us build the program. Our team members in the stores are embracing it. They're selling better than ever before and we continue to work on enhanced training and systems improvement. Last thing is to say that between those and what Steve mentioned about the new value, we're driving in the back half with the 5% reward. We believe that's going to resonate in all four corners of the store, help drive comps and improve and be part of our whole Neighbor's Club drive loyalty with our consumers. So, the lot of the data I mentioned at the May, Investor Community Day is still applicable. And we're moving in our progress rate towards our target of three to five years seeing this at about a 10% tender mix. Zachary Fadem : Great. Thanks Kurt. And then quickly on your CUE categories, could you refresh us on the subscription efforts here? You've called it out as an opportunity in the past. I know you don't push it. But any commentary on progress and whether you still think this can be a meaningful opportunity going forward? Steve Barbarick : Yes. This is Steve. We're a testimony company and this is one of the capabilities we put out there to better understand what our customers might be interested from us. We did expand the assortment out to some more animal health products, so it's not just pet food and supplies related. There's still a lot of learning to be done. And I would say at this point we're going to continue to learn as we go. The goal ultimately not only to be able to serve our customer with convenience, it might be a play down the role where we're able to connect with customers that want pellet type deliveries and more business-to-business type aspects of what we might be able to use the tool for. So, as we're thinking forward, the subscription of a bag of dog food or a treat is one thing. We're trying to think and make this more global and really tie it back to our ONETractor strategy. Zachary Fadem : Got it. Appreciate the color guys. Operator : And next we have Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey guys. Just a clarification. I mean Kurt, can you talk a little bit more about this new store delays. I'm just still a little unclear as to what that was. Was that construction delays more broadly and just you guys weren't as on top of it as you normally are or was there an internal issue? I understand it's transitory. It doesn't sound like it could be an issue going forward, but I just was \u2013 I'm still a little confused as to what drove that? Kurt Barton : Yes. Peter, appreciate the question. I'll try to help clarify on it. In the first half of the year, there were weather challenges, there are often with new stores, there are challenges just with getting through planning and regulations in the local municipalities. And we could point to all of those things and say that the weather or the regulatory items were there. But we have that and we in our view, we say we are challenged and it's our job to offset those headwinds. And we faced a lot of those headwinds and probably more headwinds than normal, and that was part of the challenge of getting stores open. And for us as a team, we look at that as an executional issue and say, we can do better at making sure that we can have the offsets that can help us not have shift in timing of stores when those headwinds pop-up like they did. Peter Benedict : Okay. Now that's helpful. And then just lastly, just on Neighbor's Club, and you guys are not giving the full numbers anymore on that. But as we think about it from a comp store basis, do you feel like you've kind of reached the penetration at least in the existing stores in terms of the number of members for customer, I mean per store? And that the growth from here, just be basically new stores or are you continuing to see some growth in members per store? Thanks. Steve Barbarick : Yes. Peter, this is Steve. And yes, we continue to see the program grow in comp stores as well as new stores. And it's still growing at a really good clip, which is exciting. And then when you add on to that, what we're doing with what Kurt talked about with the private liberal credit card, I think we'll even see more engagement and more enrollment. So again, it continues to expand. The data continues to come in. We're building out our CRM team and we're excited about what the future looks like in terms of being able to use that data and action it. Peter Benedict : Great. I appreciate that Steve. Thanks a lot guys. Mary Winn Pilkington : Greg, we'll try to flip in one more question please. Operator : Okay. In that case, we'll take the final question from Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. Brandon Fletcher : Hey guys, great quarter. Steve Barbarick : Thanks Brandon. Brandon Fletcher : I don't want to simplify your very complex business and all the hard work of everybody, but if we do what we do on the street and make this just to growth algorithm, got 6% of store growth, maybe 3% of sales, 3% of buybacks and dividends. You can adjust those however you want half a point either way that gets you to 12% kind of the center point of your growth algo. We were so impressed with the quality of the talent that you have and those that you brought in to do some really awesome stuff on analytics and supply chain and finance, et cetera. It sounds to me if you have all these awesome people, there must be some headwinds hiding in there that we'd love to have any color on. So, we know what all these great people are fighting against as to why, you know, the algorithm is kind of comfortable at 12% and that isn't reach higher beyond that. Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, sure. This is Kurt. I'll start on that. And we look at our guidance as confirming that we're doing what we'd said we do this year driving a strong comp sales performance, driving great topline, operating margin expansion with a real solid EPS growth rate. And that continues into the back half of the year. And for us, we have a lot to be excited about what we're driving overall for the expectation and guidance, which is raising that a bit from original expectation. So, the business is strong. There's a lot to be excited about it. I've mentioned it earlier; we're going to make sure halfway through the year with the consumer that is going to be facing a number of changes. We're going to be realistic with what the outcome can be in this environment. But all that given Tractor Supply has got a great algorithm as you mentioned, and great performance expected for 2019. Brandon Fletcher : Okay, great. Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Greg, that'll wrap up our call. I want to say thank you to everyone for joining us, and Mary Ann and I are around today if you have any questions for follow-up and we look forward to talking to you in October. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

And thank you for joining us to hear more about our third quarter results. The Tractor Supply team delivered a strong quarter that was in line with our expectations. I'm very pleased with the way the team balanced sales growth and operating profit margin expansion. Today, given the investments we have made in technology and tools to grow our business, we are better positioned to capitalize on the trends of our business. Our comp store sales results were driven by broad-based growth across our geographic regions. We drove solid comp sales performance in regions where we had normal or improved moisture to last year. This was partially offset by comp sales trends that were modestly below the chain average performance in the regions where there was below normal moisture, or in some even drought conditions. We continue to experience increases in both comparable average ticket and traffic, and we saw strength across our merchandising categories with the strongest sales growth in our spring and summer assortments, accompanied with solid sales growth in our core year round categories. At Tractor Supply, every quarter can play out differently from the year before as weather patterns, moisture levels, temperatures and even hurricanes will vary across our markets. These conditions will alter demand for products that we sell. This quarter was no exception, whether it be store operations, supply chain, merchandising or marketing, our teams made the necessary adjustments to serve our customers. Our supply chain teams did an excellent job managing to the demand of the business. Our ability to capitalize on geographic seasonal trends is a core competency and a strength of Tractor Supply. Overall, I'm encouraged by the underlying health of our customer and our business. So now let me comment on a few highlights for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter last year. Net sales increased 5.4% to $1.98 billion for the quarter. Comparable stores increased 2.9% in the third quarter, with $0.10 also comping positive. Our comp average ticket increased 2.3%, and transactions grew at 0.6% in the quarter. Our average ticket growth of 2.3% was positively impacted by our overall retail price management. And our team was nimble and well prepared with a great lineup of merchandise for our customers, both in our stores as well as online. Gross margin improved 28 basis points to 34.99% despite tariff headwinds. Operating profit margin improved by 2 basis points and on an adjusted basis, improved by 17 basis points. Diluted EPS was a $1.02, and adjusted EPS increased 9.5% to $1.04. Based upon our performance year-to-date, we have updated our guidance. Our forecast for fiscal year 2019 EPS is now $4.66 to $4.70. And on an adjusted basis, we are maintaining the midpoint of our full-year guidance, while narrowing the range to $4.68 to $4.72 per share. Now, let's look at several of the operational highlights for the quarter. We opened 25 new Tractor Supply stores and one Petsense location. This quarter included the celebration of our 1,800 Tractor supply store, which is located in Berkshire Township, Ohio. Our selling metrics continue to perform well through our focus on GURA and providing legendary service to our customers. For the third quarter, our customer experience GURA scores were at an all-time high. This quarter marks our 29th consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth in our e-commerce business, and we continue to experience exceptional growth with our Buy Online Pickup in Store program. This too encourage customers to come into the store to pick up online orders, resulting in about 20% of our customers making an incremental purchase. Between the combination of our Buy Online Pickup in Store and direct delivery to stores, greater than 70% of our e-commerce orders continue to be fulfilled at our stores. This illustrates the importance of our store assets and their key role in the fulfillment of our e-commerce business. Importantly, this is a cost effective way to serve our customers with greater speed, convenience and efficiency. So when reviewed, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. And before I turn the call over to Kurt, I would like to update you on the progress of the Board's CEO search. Succession planning is a top priority for our Board of Directors. And as the search is ongoing, we are committed to taking the time we need to select the right leader for the future of Tractor Supply. In the meantime, I continue to be highly engaged in the business, along with the rest of the leadership team. And when the time comes, I will be here to assist the new leader in whatever way the Board believes will make for the smoothest transitions. This talented team knows retail and specifically knows farm and ranch retail and is committed to winning. I am confident that we will achieve our goal of adding new leadership, while still delivering on our commitments to drive long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg has taken us through key highlights of the quarter, let me walk you through some of the important financial details, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter of 2019, we had solid comp store sales growth of 2.9%. All periods of the quarter were positive, with July and September having the best performance. We started out strong, as the team capitalized on the ideal summer seasonal trends. As we move through the quarter, hot and dry weather, along with lapping our hurricane benefit of 40 basis points in the prior year, which did not reoccur to the same extent, both impacted our performance. We exited the quarter with September's performance in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year. We experienced strength in product lines such as animal feed, pet supplies, lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers and hardware. At the same time, our comp store sales growth was offset by softness in UTVs and emergency response categories. These same categories are negatively impacted - negatively impacted our big ticket sales. Although we had strength in mowers, safes, log splitters and 3-point equipment, our big ticket sales were flat for the quarter as we were lapping above chain average comps in the third quarter of 2018. As we anticipated, new store openings were weighted to the latter part of the quarter and this did have an impact on our overall sales performance. For the third quarter, gross profit increased 6.3% to $694.2 million. Gross margin had a strong improvement of 28 basis points to 34.99%. The team was highly effective with our retail price management initiatives and global strategic sourcing to manage product cost increases including tariffs. Our targeted promotions were relatively consistent year-over-year. In addition, we benefited from reduction in freight expense as a percentage of net sales from our supply chain profit improvement initiatives and lower industry rates. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A, as a percentage of net sales increased by 26 basis points to 26.8%. The 26 basis point increase was primarily attributable to incremental costs associated with our new distribution facility in Frankfurt, New York, an executive transition agreement, which accounted for about 15 basis points of the increase and to a lesser extent, investment in store team member wages. These SG&A increases were partially offset by lower year-over-year incentive compensation as a percentage of net sales, as well as leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Excluding the impact of the executive transition agreement, adjusted SG&A increased by 11 basis points to 26.7%. Importantly, as Greg mentioned, we had operating margin expansion in the third quarter of 2 basis points and 17 basis points on an adjusted basis. Our effective tax rate increased about 70 basis points year-over-year to 22.2% in the third quarter, as the prior year's rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit from share-based compensation. Now to our balance sheet cash flow, we have a strong balance sheet and we continue our track record of generating strong cash flows from operations. At quarter end, our merchandised inventories were $1.81 billion, an increase of about 2.7% on a per store basis from the 2018 third quarter. The increase is principally due to inflation, including the impact from tariffs, as well as growth in fast turning everyday merchandise to support the positive trends in the business. We're very comfortable with the quality of our inventory. As we enter the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to take advantage of the change of the seasons. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We are managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 2 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have returned $611 million to shareholders through the repurchase of about 4.9 million shares of our common stock for $490 million and quarterly cash dividends totaling $121 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we repurchased over $2.95 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $1.5 billion as of the quarter end. Let's turn now to our guidance. Given our performance year-to-date, we are updating our financial outlook for 2019. For the year, we now anticipate net sales of $8.4 billion to $8.42 billion, comparable store sales growth of 3.2% to 3.4%, operating margin rate of 8.9% to 9.0%, net income of $564 million to $569 million, and adjusted net income of $566 million to $571 million, and earnings per diluted share of $4.66 to $4.70 and on an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share of $4.68 to $4.72. Both the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude the after-tax impact of executive transition agreement. We now expect share repurchases of about $525 million to $550 million for the year, compared to our prior guidance of $350 million to $450 million. For modeling purposes, weighted average shares outstanding are forecasted to be about 121 million shares. We continue to forecast capital spending in the range of $225 million to $250 million for the year, and our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of approximately 22.4% to 22.6%. Our priorities for capital deployment have been very consistent over the last several years. Our first priority is reinvestments back into the business to support the long-term growth of opening new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We are on track to open approximately 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 new Petsense stores. And we remain committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and continued share repurchases. Now recall, as we enter the year, we had anticipated having our strongest comparable store sales performance in the first half of the year with operating profit margin improvement in the second half of the year. This continues to be our expectation, given our results year-to-date through the third quarter. Being a needs-based retailer, our customers live life out here and as such, seasonal trends could impact our comp store sales performance. For the fourth quarter of 2019, please keep in mind that we are lapping model or ideal conditions in the prior year, including about a 40 basis point benefit from a hurricane that we do not anticipate to reoccur. Our comparable store sales forecast for the fourth quarter of 2019 anticipates that ticket will be the primary driver of the growth, with transactions being centered around flat, given that we are lapping transaction growth of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018. We entered this year with confidence about our ONETractor strategy and that we were making the right long-term investments in our business. I believe our results for the third quarter have supported this view, and we are looking forward to delivering a strong performance in 2019 and beyond. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Well, thank you, Kurt. Now let me turn to the progress we're making on our ONETractor strategy, and we remain focused on these four objectives; driving profitable growth; building customer-centric engagement; offering the most relevant products and services; and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities. We are pleased with the traction we're gaining with our key initiatives and specific examples include capabilities such as growth of our Neighbor's Club engagement. The chain-wide rollout of our Stockyard Kiosk and mobile point-of-sale, enhancing our Tractor Supply credit card offering and investments in our supply chain. As part of our ONETractor strategy, we are actioning the rich customer data we are receiving from our Neighbor's Club loyalty program, and the health of our program continues to be very robust as measured by membership growth, increased penetration of sales, greater frequency and higher average ticket sales by these customers. In addition, our core farm and ranch customer segment continues to be strong in both retention rates and spending. The Neighbor's Club data allows us to target specific groups based on their frequency in category specific spending. This personalized approach is allowing us to drive engagement and build share of wallet over time with our Neighbor's Club members. The strength of our loyalty program allows us to be agile, all while amplifying our message to customers. For example, with our recent TSC days promotion, the goal upfront was to support the new Tractor Supply credit card reward program and build customer acquisition in our core year-round categories. With this promotion, we were able to drive significant excitement for our new 5% PLCC rewards offer, growing sign-ups for the card and reinforcing a sense of urgency on the limited time of this promotion. It was just five days. We were successful in acquiring over 50,000 new cut customers during the event. 25,000 customers that appeared as new to our Tractor Supply file and 25,000 existing Tractor Supply customers that had previously not purchased pet in our stores. In addition, these new campaigns have things of outreach such as replenishment reminders and post-purchase follow-up for our pet customers. These are just recent examples of things we've initiated across our loyalty program. We are managing our customer data to not only target our current Tractor Supply customers but also finding new look-alike customers through social media channels. We message to these customers where they are most likely to purchase and the categories that we are targeting. And with our new technology and the use of artificial intelligence, we can optimize individual messages that resonate with each individual customer. We now have the ability to create relevant and customized messages for our customers and that's transforming our marketing initiatives, and that will improve our overall effectiveness in spend. Our Neighbor's Club membership growth continues to be transformational, and a growing asset to drive brand loyalty. With a strong one-year retention - with a strong one-year retention rates, our customer feedback continues to be overwhelmingly positive and the rollout of Stockyard kiosks allows us to provide customers with the long tail of product assortment as we have now nearly 130,000 SKUs on our website. At the store level, the Stockyard kiosks are a proven tool for driving incremental sales. The rollout of these kiosks, along with the expansion of mobile point-of-sale has now been implemented in the majority of our store base. The Tractor Supply credit card offering supports our ONETractor strategy by driving sales and building loyalty. We continue to see the use of our private-label credit card increase across-the-board, as we offer more compelling financing offers and our data supports the credit card customers that visit our stores more frequently and have a higher average spend. We continue to invest in the private label credit card program and have enhanced our rewards program to our Tractor Supply credit card holders. Cardholders now are able to earn $5 in Neighbor's Club rewards for every $100 they spend on the card, essentially, a 5% reward. Over time, we anticipate that this will become a key tool to deepen the relationship with our customers, drive loyalty and most importantly, increase our share of wallet. So now, let me briefly highlight a few merchandising initiatives. From a strategic perspective, exclusive brands are an important part of our overall merchandise offering. Our goal is to provide quality products at a value price across good, better and best segments of our business and to build loyalty with our customers. We have exciting plans for product line extensions, new categories and refreshed packaging across our exclusive brands. For example, during the third quarter, we introduced a new Workwear exclusive brand labeled Ridgecut. We recognize that we had an opportunity to close the gap on our assortments in the Workwear category. Ridgecut product line is designed for exceptional quality and durability with an outstanding value proposition versus the national brand comparison. While still early, the Ridgecut brand is exceeding our expectations and it is being well received by our customers who are finding the value and quality of Ridgecut unmatched. Further exclusive brand initiatives include new SKUs and packaging in our 4health dog food brand, expansion of equine Feed & Treats and an exciting lineup of pet supplies from MuttNation in partnership with Country Music singer, Miranda Lambert. In addition to exclusive brands, we are also committed to offering leading national brands across product categories that are relevant to our customers. Looking ahead, we are very excited about the national launch of select models of Toro products. They being the leader in the outdoor power equipment sector, this will include for us zero-turn mowers, walk-behind mowers and portable power equipment both in store and online, beginning in spring of 2020. We are committed to continually growing and investing in our stores and product offerings to meet the everyday needs of this rural lifestyle customer. A similar philosophy drives the Toro Company with its commitment to developing innovative products that help customers increase efficiency and productivity on their land. Given the shared commitment to customers and overall strategic alignment, this new partnership provides a meaningful opportunity for both companies to strengthen our positions as premier providers of outdoor products. To wrap up our conversation this morning, with fall coming to an end and the winter season rapidly approaching, we are prepared in store and online with seasonally relevant product offerings to meet our customers' needs. I want to thank the more than 33,000 team members across the company in both Tractor Supply and Petsense for a solid Q3 performance and for the dedication and hard work as they meet the needs of our every day Out Here lifestyle customer. And with that Mary Winn, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. Vicki, you want to five the instructions on the polling for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Zach Fadem : So, Greg, there's been a lot of noise out there around macro softness, particularly in some of your farming and manufacturing focus regions. I'm hoping you can clear the air here a little bit. Maybe talk about whether you've seen any disparity in these regions, or if you think any headlines out there around the trade war or other macro factors are having an impact on your business or the consumer in general? Gregory Sandfort : Zach, I'm going to turn that question over to Kurt this morning, and let him give you some thoughts. And I may follow-up with a comment or two. Kurt Barton : Zach, hi, this is Kurt. Just as a reminder on the ag economy question, as you've heard from us before, Tractor Supply doesn't serve the production farmers primary needs. For those ag production farmers, we serve their lifestyle needs just like we do with our typical customer. And so as you've indicated, we've recognized and watch closely as well. Yes, we acknowledge, there is pressure on the ag economy overall and you would imagine, as there is less income in that local economy, it would appear to be negative. As we look at our business today, we're just not seeing that with our customers and those markets. Our core customers continue to be strong. As one example, on the ag economy, in the Midwest region, where there is the heaviest presence of the ag economy for both the third quarter and year-to-date that Midwest region is performing strong and outperforming the average change. So, we've got a lot to be excited about what we're doing to drive business and meet our customer needs in the ag economy. We'll watch it very carefully. It is important, but at this point for Tractor supply, we're not seeing a real change in the trends. Zach Fadem : And then considering your margin improvement this quarter, especially on a sub three comp, could you update us on the leverage point heading into 2020? Maybe walk us through the opportunities now that you're cycling some of your investments and the profit improvement initiatives are starting to roll through? Kurt Barton : Yes, I mean you've hit - Zach, you've hit the key items on there. We continue to believe, as we move towards our long-term targets, our target of growing comp sales at 3% plus over the long term. And with the profit improvement initiatives that we have, the investments that we made in the past are plateauing but yet driving traction in both top line and efficiencies. We're going to continue with a real strong effort on efficiency and productivity. We believe there is opportunity in labor as well as transportation. And then, of course, the benefits we're getting from the top line, we anticipate with our long-term target of 3% plus that we can see a leverage point around that 3% comp sales. Operator : We will now take a question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brad Thomas : I want to ask about the performance in the big ticket items. Could you talk maybe a little bit about some of the trends from a product standpoint or if weather was an issue in this quarter? And stepping back, maybe you could add a little more color about how the new private label credit card has been performing as you're lapping its big rollout last year. Thanks. Kurt Barton : Sure, Brad. This is Kurt. I'll take both those questions, big ticket and private label credit card. As far as big ticket, there is a lot about the big ticket category that we really liked during the quarter. The important theme is, it can vary based on seasonal demand shifts. So specifically in the quarter, we saw strong performance in zero turn mowers, log splitters, safes and 3-point equipment. That was offset by categories such as UTVs and generators. And UTVs are one of the highest big ticket items, also an area that has an impact from tariffs. Generators, as Greg and I mentioned, the emergency response compares were challenging on the generator side. So when you're lapping prior year's chain average performance of big-ticket, higher than the overall performance third quarter last year. When you look at the core of it, a big ticket was still pretty strong, private label credit card continues to give us more leverage in driving big ticket. As far as private label credit card, as Greg mentioned, all metrics are showing strong performance, meaningful growth in applications, our open accounts and our tender up strong double-digit growth, and we're very excited to see a step-up in a lot of those metrics since the launch of our 5% reward. So, we'll continue with this initiative. We've said, it's a multi-year initiative, and we're very excited about what it can do to drive integration with our Neighbor's Club and overall drive both loyalty and sales. Operator : And the next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So, I know you had - hi. I know you guys had to cycle some pretty meaningful tailwinds from hurricanes, not just in 2018 but also 2017. How do you guys kind of - and again, there's always weather volatility, but do you kind of include that when you're thinking about what a more normalized comp would be, i.e., you would add back kind of the 160 basis points, 180 basis points of tailwind that you had over the last two years. ? Kurt Barton : Yes. Scott, this is Kurt. Yes, we do. We consider both of those. In regards to the hurricane, I'll just frame-up the year-over-year comparison on hurricane. Dorian was less of an impact this year than Florence was. As you know, Dorian did not actually hit land and we saw some preparedness response with Dorian. But unlike last year, we didn't see the post follow-up that you get on impact. And we called out last year that Hurricane Florence was about a 40 basis point benefit to us. Net year-over-year between the two, we look at it, is about a 10 basis point to 20 basis point headwind on the comp. But your point about the hurricanes over the last few years, it is important to look at that and we recognize that as well. Because when you look at a three-year stack and in 2017, we had two strong hurricanes in third quarter. The challenge overall and comparison on it was greater than that. And we do take that in consideration, did in our guidance, and I think it's healthy to look at that when reflecting on the real core of the business. Operator : We'll go to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : I wanted to dig into pet food category. So in early July, the FDA had announced that certain grain-free dog food could be linked to heart disease and there were 16 brands listed including 4health. We know that you didn't call out pet food as an outperforming category during the quarter. So, I'm curious if this announcement from the FDA had any impact on your pet business and maybe is there any risk of future trade down out of grain-free or even trade out from 4health? Seth Estep : Peter, this is Seth. So, yes, when we look at the overall pet animal business, looking back on the quarter, we're actually really pleased with the overall performance. Specific to pet, post that announcement, we really saw a trend similar to some of the things that you're seeing in the industry overall. What we were seeing a little bit of shift out of some of the holistic natural grain-free products and into more of the pet specialty science-based formulations. But what we were able to do and what we're seeing in our database is that we're able to capture that customer with the broad portfolio that we have within our box today. And utilizing category management as well, we're able to really respond with our shelf presence quickly to make sure that we continue to grow - to grow market share there. Relative to 4health, you mentioned that was obviously mentioned in the FDA announcement as well. One note with 4health, our original 4health lineup, which continues to be the largest segment of 4health is the formulations with wholesome grains. We are seeing a little bit of shift out of our grain-free SKUs and into the original 4health lineup. But one of the things that you will see is a response, because we have been monitoring trends over time. Actually, even in the course of the next couple of weeks, you'll continue to see new formulas of 4health being launched. You're going to see new pack sizes. Most of those tailored around that original lineup of 4health. And we really look at 4health as a key differentiator continuing going forward to really drive and protect our pet food business. So overall, happy with the performance. Peter Keith : I did want to ask a related follow-up on pet food. So, you guys ran the Buy One Get One 50% Off promo at the end of the quarter. I guess, Tractor Supply is not known as a company that runs promos late in the quarter to get sales. Greg, you had talked about this being a great traffic driving event. So, my question is there is investor concern out there that maybe you guys pulled forward sales out of Q4 with pet food. But I guess is your rebuttal on that is it, you feel you've acquired a number of new pet customers that this promo was ultimately a good success? Gregory Sandfort : Yes. Peter, it was designed to do two things. One was, it was a - an event that really comped an event from a week earlier. So, we really changed the constitution of the event and said, you know, last year's event was good, but how can you refresh it? So, we refreshed it. We also tied it into the launch of the 5% back or the $5 for every $100 with the cards. So, we felt like we had a much more compelling offer. So, we shifted both things to latter part of the quarter. And as we ran that promotion, we tightened up the number of items that were going to be in the promotion as well. We went from an eight-page to a four-page. We really consolidated down and said, let's put more effort behind fewer things and see if we can drive footsteps and also increase our penetration on the card. And it worked out beautifully. It played out exactly the way we wanted and we were very happy with the results. So, it was not an additional event by any means. It was just a different way of repackaging an event that was a week earlier from last year. Operator : Next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : The question is on gross margin. In the press release, you mentioned price management, which I assume is, I think the same price optimization program you've been doing for a long time. But it was prominently called out this quarter as a gross margin driver. Can you quantify how much it's helping gross margin. And then to what extent, is it driving comp through higher prices? Kurt Barton : Simeon, hi, this is Kurt. Let me just address gross margin and I think it will answer your question. For gross margin, I'd package it as this. There is really three key drivers that I want to point to and price management was the primary one. As far as price management, team has done a great job balancing market share and margin. And we've really advanced in these tools over the last year or so. And what the team is able to do is with price management, balance between both merchant across merchandise categories, as well as geography to get the most optimal retail price for market share and margin. Then combining into that is the price intelligence tools that we've invested in, allowing us to monitor the competitive pricing as well as gauge elasticity. So, our ability to leverage all of that today to make sure that we're capitalizing on sales and margin is really been a key factor. And so of the drivers for gross margin, first one, price management is probably the most significant. Second one would be the freight expense benefit that I referred to. And then third on gross margin. We are seeing gross margin benefit from some of the investments we're making in supply chain. And we don't speak as often to that, but with the investments in supply chain, which are in our SG&A, being new mixing centers. The new distribution centers and import transload centers gives us the ability to reduce stem miles and actually go after new strategic sourcing opportunities with lower pricing. And so there is a little bit of geography trade-off there. So, those are the three real things that the - the merchandising and supply chain did an excellent job to drive both top line and gross margin. Simeon Gutman : And the related follow-up. I assume there isn't an end in sight for this price optimization or price management continues to be a bigger driver. And in that point you made earlier about leveraging around a 3% or 3% plus, is gross margin the bigger of the levers or is SG&A? Kurt Barton : Yes. There's - first, I'd say on the pricing tools, it continues to evolve and we've got a lot of runway ahead of us. And I think every year can be different on - the answer on the operating margin. But one important thing to always remember is the investments we'll be making in our supply chain puts a little bit of a headwind on SG&A. We recognize, that drives initially some benefit in gross margin and that will be part of our investment over the next couple of years. So, you will see that. Operator : We'll go to Peter Benedict with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Benedict : Greg, I guess a question for you, with Steve's departure, just can you speak to any areas of need you think you have within the leadership team at this point? And then as the Board is conducting the CEO search, any color on kind of what precisely they're looking for in terms of a new candidate? That's my first question. Gregory Sandfort : Yes. Let me - Peter, let me address, first, your question about need. As you probably know, there were a number of things that I had passed on to Steve, probably a good 18 months or so before the decision was made that he was not the candidate. And so that's really just - kind of send it back to me. I'm having a lot of fun with it, to be very honest with you. Even I've got a lot of direct reports. It's a lot of fun to be - to have both feedback into the business and such. And it's been a really good for me and good for the team, to be honest. So, there is really no gaps. I've filled the gaps. I've also got Seth here and others, a bunch in this group. As you know, they're very talented merchants, very talented marketers, good team in general and we're moving forward. So, that's addressed that. The second piece here is what's the Board really looking for? Yeah, there is a lot of emphasis out there today on how you're using data and using information differently to drive your business as a retailer. And I think some of the things that we talked about as a Board, I'm being a part of that Board is, can we find someone that has some deep background there, that has spent some time maybe in that space, also is crossed in between physical retail and digital retail and can combine those two together to bring more to the table here at Tractor and help us accelerate that side of the business. But as I said, this is the highest priority for the Board right now. We're not in any big rush. We are making sure that we're doing the due diligence to find the right leader for this company. We want this to be a very seamless transition. I am committed to stay here as long as I need to be to make sure that, that transition goes well. We have responsibilities to our shareholders, the investment community, the company at whole. And I'm going to make sure we do this right. And as I said, it's really business as usual, maybe us pushing a little harder right now. It's tough kind of jump back into that, that component, but I'm feeling very good about the process and where we are. Peter Benedict : And then maybe, Kurt, one for you. You did a nice job kind of speaking to some of the dynamics that drove last year's strong comp in 4Q. It sounds like most of that was kind of earlier in the quarter, I think about the storms, the timing of cold weather or whatnot. And is it safe to say that, that the toughest comparisons are early in the quarter and then ease up as you move through? That's my last question. Kurt Barton : Yes, Peter, you framed it up well. Last year's strength in the comp was earlier in the quarter and it had early cold weather that drove solid performance. So the cadence of the back half could be a bit different. And so implied in our guidance is about a 2.0% to 2.5% range for fourth quarter. And the cadence between weather and even thinking about when Thanksgiving lands and the amount of weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Seth and Christi continued to optimize marketing. I would tell you that cadence could be very different year-over-year, but we feel confident about the guidance we've given to land a solid comp in the range of 2% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter. Operator : We'll go to Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Matt McClintock : This one is probably for Seth or maybe just Greg. I wanted to focus on merchandising for 2020. There is a lot of investors out there that just don't seem to have visibility into what merchandising levers you can pull in 2020 to sustain comps in the 3% plus range. And Greg, you talked about Toro and how it can be meaningful. Could it be meaningful in 2020 to total sales? And then lastly on Toro, is this the start of an acceleration of? Should we see more strategic partnerships with brands as we progress over the next couple of years? Thanks. Seth Estep : Matt, this is Seth. So from the core merchandising philosophy perspective, as merchants, we are always out there looking for what leading brands and what partnerships can we go after, that can be extremely meaningful to our customer base and the lifestyle that we serve. So specific to Toro, going to your question there, we already felt that we had one of the leading, call it, outdoor power equipment lineups in the industry. And being able to go out and partner with Toro, which is the leader when you think about the zero-turn and large acreage. We look at it as nothing but cementing us as, call it, the leader in the industry as we go here, that can have a comp impact specifically, as well as 2020 and beyond, as we continue to partner together. The other thing we look at a partnership such as this that we will continue to go after, is finding ways to drive key differentiation, specifically against farm and ranch and other competitors that are out there. Other things we look out to 2020 in key comp drivers outside of just driving newness, exclusive brands, we'll continue to go after and continue to drive a lot of newness across the four walls and exclusive brands. Greg mentioned Ridgecut earlier, but we also are doing a lot of things in our livestock feed, in our pet world, where we are going to be driving new portfolios and our do more line of goods as well as adding new product line up. So overall, I would say yes to the standpoint of we're always looking out there for new strategic partnerships, where they would be meaningful to us as an organization and be able to drive key differentiation. Operator : We'll go to Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steve Forbes : I wanted to focus on the abnormally dry weather across the lower states, where I think you sort of mentioned it in the prepared remarks, moisture versus non-moisture. But we think about maybe the last month of the quarter or versus the quarter as a whole, can you provide some additional color on the 3Q comp performance in the drought-exposed states versus those that are not? Kurt Barton : Yes, Steve, and this is Kurt. In those conditions, the key is being nimble and reacting to the change in the shift in demand. And in the month of September, the merchandising and operations team supply chain partnered well. The key there is to transition to what's needed. And what really sold was C.U.E. items like feed and forage, cooling being fans, anything that moves water. Those are the areas. To be in stock and dependable at the end of the season like that is key for us. And it's another example coming in or out of seasons why Tractor Supply chain and merchandising strength is helping us capture sales when it might not be the most ideal. So, those conditions weren't perhaps as ideal as solid moisture, which was there last year, but we're able to capitalize and actually produce a comp sales right in line with our expectations by shifting and being nimble. Steve Forbes : And then just a quick follow-up on that topic, right, you called out cycling the - I think it's a 40 basis point tailwind, hurricane-related tailwind in the fourth quarter, but is there any drought impact in the fourth quarter implied comp guide as well? Kurt Barton : Not specific to drought. I mean, fourth quarter is really about fall, winter. And temperature might be the primary factor that you think about when you're planning for and reacting to the fourth quarter. Operator : And we'll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Chuck Grom : Obviously, comp duration is pretty important. As we look ahead to 2020, I'm wondering if you guys could just sort of force rank for us all the drivers that you have in place, the Stockyard, the loyalty card, credit card, online and some of the new product categories. And then, in the past you've talked about doing some remodel activity. Just wondering if that's on the table for next year. Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, Chuck. This is Kurt. I think I heard what are the - what are the comp drivers going forward beyond 2019. Is that correct? Chuck Grom : Yes, that's right. Kurt Barton : Okay. Well, I mean, the focus is really continues to be right now, the ONETractor strategy, early in a lot of the phases and a lot of runway in there. So, our ability to drive additional market share and spend with our customers, Neighbor's Club, private label credit card and what we're doing with our omnichannel business, those complement everything Seth and the team are doing to drive additional new products and brands and creating new theater and strong complement of both national brands and exclusive brands. Those are really the primary drivers that will continue to deliver additional strength and competitive advantage for Tractor Supply in 2020 and beyond. Gregory Sandfort : Chuck, let me add one thing. It all starts with the product and our customers rely on us to have the things that they need in stock when they make use of the trip to us physically or when they shop with us online. So if you think back to the ONETractor strategy, it was all built around the - having - building the capabilities to be able to meet that customer's needs as Kurt said earlier, when they need the product and it is different by quarter. It's different by year. But what we built into this company now is a supply chain that has that nimbleness and ability to move within the 49 states that we do business and address those customers' needs in a way that most of our competition can't. So, it is really an incredible part of the business. It's the strength of ours and it really all starts with having the product when they need it, the price they expect and meeting their demands because they are going to be different year-to-year and that's not easy stuff. It's difficult to do, but we've been able to accomplish that. Chuck Grom : And then just as a follow-up. I mean, a lot made today about potential recession and so I'm curious when you look and rewind back to 2018, just wondering what the early indicators were back then in your business. People talked about some trade-down in the private brands. Just wondering what happened for you back then. And I don't think we are seeing anything in the comps position of the basket or in trip frequency that's giving you any early signs that, that something could be on the comps? Thanks. Gregory Sandfort : Chuck, let me give you a little insight as to what we look for. Back in the former recession, what we noticed early on, was a change in purchasing patterns. Customers not making as many trips to the store, number one. Number two, we saw them instead of buying a premium product and I'll call it national branded feeds. We saw them shifting back into our brands and feeds because they were a better value. We're not seeing any of that right now. We're not seeing any change at all the. The actual customer count and our transaction count and average transaction was up almost $1 this quarter. So, we are very pleased with, call it, the core business of our company looks, and this core customer looks to be very much intact. So, I don't - we're not seeing any indications at this point of any slowdown from that standpoint. And again, I think if there is something on the horizon, it will look a little different probably than last time, but we will see the indicators first and we will be the first to share them with you. Operator : We'll go to Michael Lasser with UBS. Mark Carden : It's actually Mark Carden on for Michael Lasser today. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Can you guys speak to your store growth potential and if there's been any change in your mindset here? Thanks. Kurt Barton : This is Kurt. Store growth potential continue to be consistent with what we've said. We evaluate this, monitor it routinely. We're targeting that domestically 2,500 stores and our cadence is - has been consistent. And at this point, we continue to plan to reinvest in new store growth at a consistent pace, along with investing in our existing stores to continue to drive value and sales out of the existing box . Mark Carden : And then traffic growth slowed a bit on a two-year stack. Can you guys talk a bit about what's been driving that and how much of its weather related, and then any comments on the outlook for commodity inflation? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Okay. So, I'll take those. On the traffic, the important factors, we're lapping strong traffic comps over the last couple years in the third quarter. And then hurricane, as I mentioned, which didn't reoccur at the same extent, hurricanes drive traffic and they drive it pre and post. And so when you think about the traffic patterns there, there is a headwind in there. And so year-to-date, nine months in, we have a solid traffic growth of 1.1%. And there is, as I mentioned earlier on a question, every quarter could be a bit different and hurricane in some of the weather patterns had a bit of an impact on the level of traffic comp in Q3. As far as commodities, looking ahead, I'll just mention for commodity base, year-to-date, and I would expect this to be very similar for fourth quarter. We're seeing net modest commodity inflation. And that's one of just several factors that play into the average ticket. Addition to commodity-based impact, we're seeing broad-based cost increases in the product input costs. That's either manufacturing cost increases or pass-through of tariffs. So the ticket price reflects those three things; the commodity influx, the broad-based product costs, as well as retail price adjustments that we make for direct import tariffs that we're incurring. Operator : We'll go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : I have a follow up on the average ticket question. If you wouldn't mind giving us a little bit more color, Kurt, on the impact of tariffs on the comps this quarter and then followed by any impact on the margin rate. Kurt Barton : Sure. So the level of cost increases, I just mentioned, last one is a balance of those three things. And the ticket is pretty well balanced in this quarter between product mix and cost increases, and tariffs are just a piece of that. So trying to split out the exact level of tariffs, I'd just say it's generally in line with our expectation and of the cost increases, it's one of about three factors. And as we've mentioned in the past, we have, 10% of our products are direct import. Seth Basham : As it relates to direct import and exclusive brands, we saw second quarter of a tick down in the mix of products or sales in those categories. Are you intentionally shifting sourcing away from those areas or how should we interpret that? Seth Estep : Yes, this is Seth. No - so we have an entire team, obviously, really focused and dedicated on exclusive brand sourcing. Some of the things that we are doing, I mean, we are fully dedicated to our strategic sourcing initiatives. But some of the things that we are doing based off the tariff environment, we have shifted some things back domestically as well to other countries where we find opportunities. That first and foremost can meet our quality expectations and meet the standards of our exclusive branded product. Give you example of one product, an example even this past year you think about to your point Q2, historically, we have been 100% direct import on barn fans. And this past year, we found a domestic source of supply in Texas that allowed us to have some land cost efficiencies and mitigate tariff impacts and actually let us be more responsive to the business throughout the quarter. So, we'll continue to work on a strategic sourcing initiatives. But we'll continue to drive our exclusive brand piece there as well. Seth Basham : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Vicki, I think we've got time - one more question, please. Operator : And that will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Chuck Cerankosky : Greg, I want to talk a little bit about storing. Your mentioned you've got over 1,800 store in Ohio, where we already have a lot of stores. What kind of informs the store location decision? We already have a fairly dense footprint. And then, what are you doing with regard to store relocations as you manage the store base in the US? Gregory Sandfort : Okay, Chuck. Let me break that out for you a little bit to say that. Number one, there is a model that we use for store location and it is very robust. That has about 60 inputs. It has been refined four time since I've been here at the company. And if you place a store, what the model tells you to place a store, it performs and it typically either achieves or overachieves its pro forma expectations. So it's a very sophisticated model. It also has, like I said, many inputs, and that helps us look at not only putting a store, maybe in an area where there may be other stores, but possibly wanting to take a little bit of the pressure off of some higher-volume stores through some cannibalization that's intended to do just that. Ironically, when we do those things, we find that over a period of several years, the stores that we intentionally cannibalized seem to reach back to a fairly normal level, maybe the prior level where they were. And now we've just taken and added another $3 million or $4 million worth of volume in that same market. We've grown the market. So, there is a lot of time and effort that's put into choosing a store location. The second thing is, as far as relocations, we don't do as many of those year-to-year, as we probably are doing new stores now. But if you look at the retail market within a certain geographic space, we're replacing a store. Sometimes in some of these small communities, the retail sector for the retail path will shift from east to west or north to south in a small town. And one of the reasons we like to lease our locations versus purchase them is because it gives us the ability to be able to move that store when those types of things happen. I'm not going to be sitting with basically a piece of real estate that has no value. So, we'll probably do less than 10 to 12 relocations a year. Most of those are those types of movements. Sometimes it may be one town over from where we were, but generally right now, we're still putting in new store base, still adding as I said, the use of the model and very pleased with the continued performance of the new stores. Chuck Cerankosky : And thank you for that. And lastly, Kurt called out reduced transportation costs. Is that a function in some part of the new distribution center in New York State? Or is that facility still a bit of a drag on the margin? Kurt Barton : Chuck, this is Kurt. When it comes to transportation, freight costs, the team is hitting on all three metrics that they focused on this year. They are reducing stem miles and the new distribution helps with that, reducing domestic carrier rates and increasing the inventory value per load. Those are the three primary reasons and drivers of reduced freight expense. Yes, the new distribution center costs has a bit of an impact on SG&A. But freight expense, they're hitting on all metrics. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks a lot. So that wraps up our call. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us on our next quarterly earnings call in January of 2020. I will be around for Q&A. And we thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply. Operator : Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Good morning everyone who's joining us on the call today. Before we discuss our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a moment and update you on the CEO leadership change at Tractor Supply that we announced in December. Hal Lawton officially joined the company in mid-January as President and CEO. The board engaged in a thorough and comprehensive search to identify the right leader for this next chapter in the company's growth. I am very excited that the Board chose Hal as the next CEO for our company. Hal brings tremendous experience across multiple retailers including Home Depot, eBay and Macy's. And more importantly, Hal is a great cultural fit and I believe he is the right leader for the future growth of Tractor Supply. As we have previously communicated, I will continue to be available as an advisor to Hal and the company through August and will serve out my board term through May. My expectation is that this will be a very smooth transition. As this will be my last earnings call, I want to reiterate that it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as the CEO of Tractor Supply. The Tractor Supply Company is a special company with a unique culture like no other in retail. I believe the company is in great hands with Hal, as CEO. The company has a strong leadership team in place that is passionate about helping our customers live life out here. While the Tractor Supply chain has made tremendous progress in recent years, I believe there is considerable opportunity ahead. And now I'll turn the call over to Hal for a few comments before we address our quarterly results and outlook. Harry Lawton : Thanks so much, Greg. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be at Tractor Supply. For many years in my retail career, I have watched and admired this company. Under Greg's leadership the team has achieved remarkable results and I'm honored to follow in his footsteps. As you are acutely aware the retail industry is experiencing disruption and reinvention at an unprecedented speed. Leading retailers need to excel at not only merchandising customer service and execution, but also at data, technology, flexible supply chains and productivity. The key for successful retailers, however, will continue to be the same a differentiated customer experience. With more than 2,000 stores complemented by our online sites, Tractor Supply has substantial scale, very high brand loyalty with our customers an incredible culture that is part of our secret sauce and a business model that is supported by a strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation. At Tractor Supply, we have a differentiated experience, a robust set of competencies and are well-positioned to become an even more integral part of our customers' lives. I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to build on the One Tractor foundation the team has in place to drive the business forward. We are committed to executing on our 2020 initiatives and delivering on our plans for the coming year. The Tractor Supply team has been very welcoming me since the transition was announced. In the coming weeks and months, I'll be out in our stores and distribution centers, listening and learning as I spend time with our team members and customers. I look forward to engaging with you in the future. And now I'll turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory Sandfort : Thank you, Hal. And now let's move on to the results. Overall, 2019 was a solid year for Tractor Supply with record sales and earnings. While the fourth quarter of 2019 did not meet our expectations on the topline the team did a great job of controlling those things we could manage. And as a result, we delivered operating profit margin expansion for both the quarter and the year. The most significant factor weighing on our sales results in the fourth quarter was unfavorable seasonal weather trends. Across many of our markets we were negatively impacted in the quarter with unseasonably warm temperatures, which hampered our ability to drive topline sales in numerous seasonal categories. As I have shared with you consistently over time, the Tractor Supply customer is a needs-based demand-driven shopper and there is relatively little that will influence the customers' purchasing decision if that need doesn't exist. Given the stronger traffic trends -- the softer traffic trends, we were unable to capitalize on impulse or ancillary purchases. And as you have heard from other retailers I believe the six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas over the prior year impacted our customers' gift-giving purchase activity to a greater degree than we had anticipated. Over my 12 years with Tractor Supply, I have experienced the seasonal impacts before the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in the first quarter of 2017. And as always was the case when temperatures arrived with a seasonal change, the sales demand also returned. Despite the softness in our comp store sales, the underlying health of our business remains solid as evidenced by the continued strength of our core year round farm and ranch categories, which generated overall solid comp sales increases in line with our expectations and historical norms. The teams executed well across store operations, merchandising supply chain, planning and placement. The teams managed inventories effectively and minimized our clearance exposure. We leveraged our retail price optimization capabilities to preserve margins and we had disciplined cost control throughout the quarter. I am very proud of how this team reacted to and effectively managed our fourth quarter business. Now, let me touch on a few financial highlights for the quarter and the full year. For the year, net sales increased 5.6% and comparable store sales increased 2.7% to reach a record $8.35 billion in sales. In the fourth quarter, comparable store sales continued positive as we lapped a strong 5.7% increase in the prior year quarter. For the fourth quarter, diluted EPS increased 9% to $1.21. And for the full year, diluted EPS was $4.66, and adjusted diluted EPS was $4.68. We've returned $696 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends for the year. And this was the ninth consecutive year that we increased our quarterly cash dividend for our shareholders. In terms of operational highlights for 2019. We opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and eight Petsense locations, increasing our store count to over 2,000 stores. We made solid progress on many of our ONETractor strategic initiatives. We completed the rollout of stockyard in-store kiosk and mobile POS technologies to all stores across the chain. We continued to experience a robust Neighbor's Club loyalty program with membership approaching nearly 15 million members as we exited the year and a retention rate of approximately 80%. In addition, we also made great progress to improve our targeting of high value customers and look-alike customers throughout various digital channels. We continued to invest in our dot-com business and sales once again grew strong double digits for the quarter and year. Our private label credit card program was significantly enhanced with a new 5% back reward to our Neighbor's Club members. And we completed the ramp-up of our new distribution center in Frankfort New York to support our continued store growth in the Northeast. We also achieved LEED Silver Certification for this facility, making this the third LEED Silver Certification facility in our fleet. And Tractor Supply was named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies for the second year in a row. So, to summarize, 2019 was a solid year for Tractor Supply. And the team has a good handle on the business and has built a robust plan for 2020. In over 80 years' time, Tractor Supply has grown from a mail-order catalog business to the largest farm and ranch retailer in the country. And our passionate commitment to our customers, team members, communities, as well as our shareholders is the foundation of our growth. All that has been accomplished over my 12-year tenure at Tractor Supply has been a total team effort. I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to the nearly 34,000 team members across Tractor Supply and Petsense for a job well done. And I'm excited to watch the progress and growth for Tractor Supply that Hal and the team will provide in the coming years. I will now turn the call over to Kurt, who will provide more details on our financial results for 2019 and our outlook for 2020. Kurt Barton : Thanks, Greg. Please accept my many thanks for your friendship and your leadership. On behalf of the entire team, thank you for all you've done for Tractor Supply for the last 12 years. Now, let's get right into the results for the fourth quarter and the year. Sometimes weather-driven demand can help sales growth and then sometimes, it works against us. Every quarter can be a little different at Tractor Supply. What is at the core of our mission is that, we are there for our customers, with the right products they need at that time and the right price. To build on what Greg shared with you, our comparable store sales performance was driven by continued strength in our core farm and ranch categories, such as livestock feed, sensing forage and animal health. Offsetting this strength was softness in categories such as generators, rubber footwear, heating equipment, safes insulated outerwear and toys. Within consumables, our pet food category average unit retail was impacted by the industry trend of trade down from grain-free products. Of significance, our data shows that we are retaining our customers, given the sales trends across the breadth of our product category offering. In the quarter, we continued to drive comp increase of tonnage or pounds sold, as total pounds of pet food. As well, our pet supplies categories were up mid-single digits on a comparable store basis. We would anticipate the trade down trend to continue in the first half of 2020, until we cycle in the third quarter. The unfavorable trends Greg mentioned, coupled with lapping the hurricane benefit from emergency to response categories in the fourth quarter of 2018, impacted our big ticket performance. We experienced softer results across generators, safes, stoves and air compressors. Last year in the fourth quarter, we shared with you that, we believe comp sales benefited by about 100 basis points from the weather. This year, we estimate the negative impact from warmer weather represented about two-thirds of the comp miss versus our expectations. Moving down the income statement, for the fourth quarter, gross margin increased 26 basis points to 33.8%. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in freight expense as a percentage of net sales from our cost reduction initiatives and the overall market and to a lesser extent, the team's effective management of our direct product margins, as they work to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter increased three basis points to 25.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to deleverage and store personnel occupancy and other costs given the comparable store sales performance and incremental costs associated with the new distribution facility in Frankfort New York. Partially offsetting these SG&A increases were a decrease in incentive compensation as well as disciplined cost management by the team. Looking at our balance sheet, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are very comfortable with its quality. As we enter the year, we're well-positioned to wrap-up the winter months and transition into the coming spring season. In 2019, we generated cash from operations of $812 million, an increase of about 17% over the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $217 million with approximately 35% of this being maintenance related and the remaining 65% being growth oriented in areas such as new stores, digital capability investments and supply chain infrastructure. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We're managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 2 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR. The majority of our debt is a very low fixed rate. And we're comfortable with our debt maturity ladder. For the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 5.4 million shares of our common stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we've repurchased just over $3 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $1.5 billion as of year-end. Turning now to 2020, we will continue to build on our strong foundation for long-term success across the business. Our strategic initiatives are focused on allowing us to exceed our customers, ever-evolving expectation and position us for further growth. The offering of relevant products and services for our rural lifestyle customer is at the core of our merchandising plans. We will continue the introduction of industry-leading and differentiated brands. Coming into the spring season, the team is very energized about the launch of Toro as this brand has a strong reputation for quality that really resonates with our customers. The Toro brand provides us with the opportunity to attract new customers and be more relevant with our existing customers. We are also expanding our product assortment with a broader lineup of Cub Cadet and the addition of Troy-Bilt. Combined, these brands will help solidify our position as a premier destination in the lawn and garden category and enhance our already industry-leading lineup. In equine feed, we have added the premium brand Triple Crown across the majority of our stores to further round out our strong offering in this category. New space productivity technology for SKU localization and assortment will be implemented across the chain to help drive specific growth plans by category and refine our product mix. In addition, we'll be looking to enhance the shopping experience through selective store within a store expansion with an emphasis on winning brands such as Carhartt in workwear, Purina in livestock feed and Husqvarna for outdoor power equipment. Overall, it is imperative that we merchandise our stores with the products and brands at everyday low price our customers expect. Exclusive brands continue to play an important role in our offerings. You can expect to see newness through brand refreshes and line extensions across our exclusive brand portfolio. For example, Ridgecut, our new exclusive workwear brand will be expanded into footwear and accessories. Our initiatives to drive loyalty through our Neighbor's Club program play an important role in connecting with our customers on a more personal level. Our loyalty program is a transformational asset to Tractor Supply that we will continue to elevate to drive greater relevance, engagement and loyalty. We're actioning the rich customer data we are receiving from our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. The health of our program continues to be very robust as measured by membership growth, increased penetration of sales, greater frequency and higher average ticket sales by these customers. In addition, our core farm and ranch customer, which is our largest group by sales continues to be strong across growth, retention rates and spending. Looking ahead, our artificial intelligence enabled tools allow us to scale our marketing efforts to target communication on a one-on-one basis. Our Neighbor's Club communication is being customized to offer products and services to an existing customer, engage a lapsed customer, or welcome a new customer to the program. Our private label credit card continues to be a win for us. With the addition of a 5% reward that we rolled out at the end of September 2019, cardholders are now able to earn $5 in Neighbor's Club rewards for every $100 they spend on card. The loyalty proposition is more competitive and easier for our team members to communicate. We exited 2019 with an annual tender penetration rate approaching 5% with all metrics since the rollout of the reward positive. We've seen robust growth across applications, sales and tender penetration. In 2020, we anticipate capitalizing on the program enhancements to expand the Tractor Supply credit card penetration as we know that our credit card customers visit our stores more frequently and have a higher average spend. Across the organization there is much work underway to support our strategic initiatives and to extend our leadership position in our markets. What I've shared with you today are just some of the areas where the team's focused to drive the business. Let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2020. We expect net sales in the range of $8.75 billion to $8.9 billion, an increase of approximately 5% to 6.5%. Comp store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 1.5% to 3%. We anticipate opening about 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 new Petsense locations. The cadence of new store openings this year should be more in line with our historical trends as we anticipate more balanced openings in the first half of the year. Our expectation is for modest gross margin improvement in 2020. We're forecasting slight pressure on SG&A due to ongoing wage pressures and investments in our supply chain and digital space. Our outlook includes progress on our profit improvement plans to help mitigate cost pressures and our ability to reinvest back in the business over time. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities all on a sustainable basis. For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be centered around 8.9% with a clear emphasis on maintaining our margin rate. Net income is forecast in the range of $575 million to $595 million or $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business. As you model 2020, please keep in mind key factors to the cadence of our year. Our business performance is expected to be stronger in the second half of the year as our compares ease. The first quarter of 2020 is forecasted to have the lowest comp performance of the year and correspondingly, the most pressure on operating profit. As such, we anticipate first quarter net income and diluted earnings per share to be flat to the prior year's quarter. Significant factors driving this performance include a discrete executive transition cost of about $0.02 per share, the incremental cost from the Frankfort distribution center that we do not lap until the latter portion of Q1 and cycling our toughest comps of the year. Although, we are seeing the unseasonably warm weather trends continue into January, there is a significant amount of the first quarter and the year ahead of us. Moving to below the line, our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.4% to 22.7%, as we do not expect discrete tax benefits that we received in 2019 to reoccur this year. Interest expense is forecast to be approximately $22 million to $25 million. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase 4% to 7%. This is below our recent run rate as we cycle the step-up in depreciation from the addition of our new distribution center in the first quarter of 2019. As such, the growth rate will be towards the higher end of the range first half of the year with the lower growth in the second half of the year. For the year, our share repurchases are anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 117 million to 118 million shares in 2020. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $225 million to $275 million with roughly two-thirds of that spending going towards initiatives to support long-term growth. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our growth initiatives. We also are committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases. That now concludes our prepared remarks. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Kurt. David, we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : And we'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Q - Michael Lasser Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question and Greg congratulations. And Hal best of luck. A - Harry Lawton Thank you. Q - Michael Lasser My question is on traffic. You're suggesting that the year will improve as it goes on. So, when can we really expect that traffic is going to get better? A - Kurt Barton Michael, this is Kurt. The traffic trends for Tractor Supply as Greg mentioned, the core of the business has been very consistent throughout 2019. And really the significant headwind that we face in any particular quarter are more about the compares as we saw in 2019. And as we look at fourth quarter and transition into 2020, the traffic headwinds were more related to the weather and seasonal trends. So looking ahead to 2020, I pointed out to you, the toughest compares in first quarter and even indicated what we've seen thus far in January from less than ideal weather conditions. Outside of that, we anticipate to be able to drive comps in both traffic and ticket and the compares on traffic to ease more in the second half of the year. Q - Michael Lasser And really a follow-up question is putting the 1.5% to 3% comp guidance for this year in the context of a 3% plus long-term comp guide target, the market's historically relied on maybe 1% to 2% growth in traffic and 1% to 2% growth in ticket. Is that still a reasonable expectation over the long run? Because some may argue that given how much -- how many initiatives have been in place the traffic from the quarter -- from the fourth quarter may signal that traffic growth moving forward might be a little slower. A - Gregory Sandfort For the long-term Michael, we would anticipate that we'll continue to have a balance of both, trying to be more specific on either one of those in any particular year in the long-term not reasonable. But I would say that our plans from the initiatives that we talked about expect us to be able to drive traffic and market share, but we also see with the merchandising initiatives that ticket is going to play a key part in 2020 and long-term as well. Q - Michael Lasser Thank you very much and good luck again. Operator And next we'll go to Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Q - Chandni Luthra Hi. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Kate McShane. Thank you for taking my question. I guess we wanted to ask about understanding the margin opportunity at both ends of your comp guidance. Is it safe to assume that there could be more margin opportunity at the 3% range? And do you have to capture SG&A to keep margins flat at the low end of your comp range? Thank you. A - Kurt Barton Sure. This is Kurt. The operating margin rate as I mentioned, we're very focused on maintaining the margin rate in 2020. Low end and top end of the range there's a number of variables that can play into the drivers of that. And we believe we've got the flexibility and strong plans in place that allow us at both ends of those range. There is -- at the top and bottom end there's sales mix that can play into that as well as the team's ability to drive benefit from profit improvement. But even as we've shown in fourth quarter, the team can flex down and manage expenses well. So we believe we've got plans and we'll be very focused on either end of that range to maintain our operating margin for 2020 centered around at 8.9%. Q - Chandni Luthra Thank you. And if I could quickly follow-up in terms of just the health of the consumer. Are you seeing any signs of weakness from the energy economy? Thank you so much. A - Gregory Sandfort I'll take that one. This is Greg. We've seen really no significant overhang from the chain in the oil markets. And it's only about 10% of our mix anyway. And so I would tell you that no nothing significant and we always look for indicators trading down of different things like within feed and such. That's a pretty good indicator of what may be happening with consumers' overall confidence. We're not seeing any of that. So, for right now, I'd say steady as she goes. Q - Chandni Luthra Great. Thanks, Greg. Good luck. Operator And next we'll go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Q - Gustavo Gonzalez Hi. Good morning. This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot today. Thank you for taking our question. I guess just in regards to pet food, and obviously the recent trend away from natural grain-free products. Can you sort of provide us any more updates on what you're kind of seeing in that segment? And if anything kind of what you guys are able to do to sort of combat that trend? A - Seth Estep Yeah. This is Seth. So similar to what Kurt stated on the call earlier and we mentioned in the last quarter, the grain-free trends due to the DCM announcement in early Q3 of last year has caused a little bit of averaging our retail decline that we've been very open about. We have got a very robust category management approach that we've been utilizing. And actually next week, over the course of the next two weeks in our stores, you'll see some significant reset activity as we continue to respond to those trends. We'll have over 80 new items get launched in the stores. We'll also continue to be expanding upon the brands that are benefiting from the recent trends. And we'll be launching new brands as well. So, you'll see candidate coming our store. You'll continue to see new innovation through our 4health lineup, and a new sub-brand called Thrive. We're fully committed to continuing to evolve with the trends in pet. And we continue to see pet and pet food as a future growth engine for us. Q - Gustavo Gonzalez Got it. Thanks. And just one unrelated follow-up. So it looks like our data kind of points to general pet food kind of seeing a pickup in inflation in 2019 versus more of a deflationary trend over the past few years or so. Is that kind of something that has manifested in your results recently across the pet business? And kind of what would be your sense as to what is driving that recent pick up? A - Seth Estep Yeah. I mean, when you look at the industry trends that are out there, when you see some of that inflationary trend, I would say that's within the brands themselves. So, if you look at some of the introductions of the premium product in mass and grocery, obviously, they're seeing some price upticks as it relates to their mix. However, when you look across our portfolio, when you look at the back half of the year, we did see some of the average unit retail decline just strictly due to the trade down and trade across from some of the super-premium grain products versus more of the traditional premium products. So, at this point, we're not seeing anything that's significant in terms of inflation. Q - Gustavo Gonzalez Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys. Operator Okay. Next, we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Q - Simeon Gutman Thanks everyone, and Greg, congratulations, good luck, and Hal welcome. My first question is on 2020 network. So, you guided [indiscernible] a few times. It feels like it's not a natural number of the business given what you're seeing today as opposed to Hal having a chance to look at the business and we make an assessment. And I just wanted to confirm that and maybe hear from Hal presenting initial thoughts on the level of investment that the business has been making over time and then the initial thoughts he had been looking into the business. A - Mary Winn Pilkington Simeon, this is Mary Winn. We really are having a hard time hearing you on your line. So if you don't mind, can we get you to repeat that question? Q - Simeon Gutman Yeah. Here I took up handset. Is that better? A - Mary Winn Pilkington Modestly. Q - Simeon Gutman Okay. My first question was on the 2020 [indiscernible] trend -- flat margin. It feels like that. Okay. I'll get back into the queue.  A - Mary Winn Pilkington  Okay. Thank you. Okay we'll just move on to the next question. Operator Next we'll go to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Q - Christopher Horvers Thanks and good morning. And Greg it's been a pleasure all these years and congratulations on a wonderful career. And Hal it's great to be working -- it's really great to be working with you again. So I'm really excited about everybody's future here. I wanted to still put a question to both of you. So sort of how do you think about the need to invest here? You guys have put a lot of money into the business over the last few years, your stockyard kiosk roll out buy online pick up in store loyalty card enhancements. So what do you think the big sort of investment buckets that are left is sort of click and collect something that you think is right for your customer in box size? Is there sort of like a big data -- sort of data science need that you'd like to build out? Just trying to get a sense of what big things are -- not to do versus what you've accomplished so far and how maybe that could impact spending?  A - Gregory Sandfort Chris this is Greg. I'll start out by saying that you're right, we've made some investments. It's a terrific foundation. But those investments are beginning to scale. I mean these things take time. And what -- we're happy with what we're seeing whether it be a Neighbor's Club or be it in the use of stockyard, the mobile POS initiatives many of the things that we've put money into -- I would tell you that this is a wonderful jumping off point for me and a wonderful entry point for Hal. So from there I think Hal, I'll let you take it. A - Harry Lawton Thanks Greg. First off I'd just say I'm incredibly excited to be at Tractor. It's a special retailer as I said in the opening remarks with a real clear purpose. And I'd start with just saying, I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to build on the foundation that the team already has in place to drive the business forward. As Greg said there's a number of really strong initiatives that are just starting to get scale. We've incorporated those into our 2020 plan. I think it's a robust and realistic and prudent plan. The team has a track record of success and there is a strong management team in place. I'd say as it relates to me, I'm really spending my -- this is week three for me. I'm spending a lot of time listening and learning right now with Greg with the management team, spending time in our stores and our distribution centers. And everything I'm seeing is only -- it's even better than what I had anticipated. So, I'm really pleased with the first three weeks in. And as I learn more in the team -- and things -- and our views evolve, I look forward to sharing with the investor community over time.  Q - Christopher Horvers Understood. So, sort of a lot of money put in and figuring out where things are, so in a sense a little bit TBD\u2026 A - Harry Lawton No, go ahead. Q - Christopher Horvers No go ahead, I think you want to add there. A - Harry Lawton So, I was going to say I think that's a fair assessment to me personally. I think as it relates to the business, we're very executed -- very focused on executing our 2020 plan. As Greg said in his opening remarks, we're very committed to a seamless transition here. There's a very purposeful overlap organized by him and myself as well as the board. And we have a strategy and a game plan in place for 2020. And as it relates to any updates that we may make in our long-term strategy targets, we'll share more with you that as it evolves. But we have a very clear 2020 plan. Q - Christopher Horvers Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that two-thirds of the comp shortfall was weather, so call that maybe 150 basis points. Do you think the rest was the six days? And does that suggest that you think the underlying business is sort of that 2% to 2.5% that you had originally guided for? And related to that, do you think that, do you expect 1Q comps to be positive given the impact of the weather so far? A - Kurt Barton Chris, this is Kurt. So, there was a number of points in there. I'll just take the clarification on the fourth quarter, what was the impact. We estimate based on the data that about two-thirds of the miss to our expectation is weather related. We have very specific weather-related items that we sell. And we also know when the customer comes in for those seasonal weather trends needs-based items. There's additional items they purchase on their trip. Two-thirds of our shift in the comp performance, we would package as weather-related in those two categories. The remaining one-third is pretty well balanced between what we mentioned on. We feel like there was an expectation -- an impact from the six less shopping days. And we also mentioned the AUR shift in the pet side of it, so those two really round out that remaining one-thirds. And the core of the business as Greg mentioned is strong. And the Q merchandise has consistently performed solid comps in all four quarters of 2019. And as you know, we've talked about -- that's the core of our business. That's what fundamentally we take into 2020. And we capitalize on seasonal weather trends as the opportunity exists. Q - Christopher Horvers On 1Q? A - Kurt Barton Chris, on 1Q like I said, we anticipate first quarter to be our toughest compare. And January weather conditions are not ideal at this point. But as it's the earliest part of our quarter, we still have a lot of the quarter ahead of us. Q - Christopher Horvers Understood. A - Kurt Barton And as you know, Q1 is a transitional quarter and you have us transitioning out of winter and into spring. And the timing of that transition can really shift between Q1 and Q2. So, still so much about the quarter and the first half still ahead of us. Q - Christopher Horvers Got it. Thank you. Best of luck. Operator And next we'll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Q - Chuck Grom Good morning. Congrats. Good luck to both Greg and Hal here. Hal, one for you just to kind of pivot off of Chris' question, I know it's only been 20 days or so. But I guess just bigger picture, how are you thinking about the foundation of the company in terms of store targets, the optionality with loyalty with what you've seen at HD in Macy's. And I guess, ultimately, do you think 9% is the right operating margin for the business to succeed? A - Harry Lawton Hi, good morning. To start with what I said earlier is that, I'm incredibly thrilled to be here at Tractor Supply, just a few weeks in, doing a lot of listening and learning right now. I think probably the best way to answer that would be just explain what attracted me to Tractor Supply. I start with -- it is very much a differentiated leading retailer in the space, with a strong brand, a true reason for being, in a differentiated customer base, a very special culture and unique opportunities for growth. I'd also comment that the team has made a number of investments in the last few years, which are starting to scale. And you're seeing the benefits of those with our customers. And we're confident that those will continue to deliver results in 2020. I also do think that there is, as I said in my opening remarks, an opportunity to continue to become even more, integral, into our customers' lives. And things like the Neighbor's Club and other categories that we are pushing on. And activities are going to help us do that. But I'm very excited to be here. And as I said earlier is I look forward to engaging with the investment community over time as appropriate. Q - Chuck Grom Okay, so, no initial thoughts on, store targets or margins at this point? A - Harry Lawton We have no updates to any of our long-term targets, at this time. As we're still -- those are still very much what we're focused on. And I think our 2020 guidance is consistent with those. Q - Chuck Grom Okay, fair enough. And then just on 2020, when you think about what Tractor can control in terms of sales. Can you force rank where you guys see the most optionality over the next four quarters in terms of Neighbor's Club, cultivating the relationships that you've built up kiosks digital? I know you got a couple of new brands hitting Toro. Just help us contextualize how you think about the year, in terms of what you guys can control? Thanks. A - Kurt Barton Chuck, this is Kurt. I mentioned three things that, we look at as the Tractor Supply controlled initiatives that we believe benefit us in 2020 and we're going to lean on and we've made the investments. First is, the relevant products and services. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our outdoor powered equipment lineup is strong, going into the spring/summer season. So we'll lean on the combination of those brands there as well as the introduction of Triple Crown. In addition to that, secondly, our private label credit card momentum is strong, coming off the introduction of the 5% reward back. And we'll carry that momentum out of the fourth quarter into 2020. And we believe it's a sales driving asset that we've got. And then, I'd ranked third with that as Neighbor's Club. And how we're actioning the data as we mentioned to be able to not only retain and communicate with potential lapse customers. But as a lifestyle retailer, the ability to find look-alike lifestylers and then digitally engage with them is a completely new tool that we've got. We started to put that into place in the back half of 2019. And I guess after those three, I'd throw in that, we're excited about what John Ordus and the store operations team is doing with their Tractor Way program that came out of operational efficiency. They've taken work out of the back room. And they're moving it to selling cultures. And where we've introduced that, earlier in 2019, availability of product, scores from our customers were up and customer service scores as well. And we know if those two increase it's positive to sales. So, we also believe fundamentally there's some good traction in that program. Q - Chuck Grom Very helpful. Thanks and good luck. Operator Next we'll go to Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Q - Steven Forbes Good morning. I wanted to\u2026 A - Harry Lawton Good morning, Steven. Q - Steven Forbes \u2026maybe revisit the fourth quarter traffic performance. Maybe if you could provide a little more color around maybe the cadence of traffic where risks -- or if the weakness was concentrated during a specific period in the quarter. It really is like if you compare December traffic trends versus the average, I mean, is there a large call out or any sort of quantification you can provide us?  A - Kurt Barton Yeah. Steven, this is Kurt. In regards to the traffic trends, first, the primary drivers mentioned was weather related. And I'd point that out, because the two real factors on both comps and traffic were about comparing up against a strong hurricane in October of 2018 and then the expected positive change in weather conditions in December not actually occurring as expected and heavily forecasted. So, in regards to the cadence and expectation, October and November as we expected saw some decline in traffic, because hurricanes drive a good heavy amount of traffic. You even get the ancillary customer coming in for that destination. November was extremely cold last year. So, October, November while traffic was down was not against our expectation. The expectation was we would see more normalized December cold weather and that's really in both total and traffic where the missed expectation occurred as principally in the month of December. Q - Steven Forbes And just a quick follow-up right maybe stay with you Kurt, if you can just help us better understand the monthly weights as we look out the fourth quarter -- the first quarter, what does January represent as a percentage of the total as we conceptualize right the ongoing weather risk? A - Kurt Barton Steven, we don't give specifics. But as we've said in the past the quarter, the month weight heavier as you move through the quarter. So, January is the weakest in total percentage of the three and March is the heaviest. Q - Steven Forbes Thank you. Operator And next we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Q - Simeon Gutman Thanks. Is the volume better now? A - Harry Lawton Yeah. A - Mary Winn Pilkington  It\u2019s better. Thank you. Q - Simeon Gutman Okay. Thank you. And Greg congratulations and good luck in retirement. And welcome Hal. A - Harry Lawton Thank you. Q - Simeon Gutman My question the first one is on 2020, you talked a little bit historically about getting up leverage closer to 3% -- at the 3% level. You're getting to flattish margins with a little bit less than that in 2020 at least the midpoint of the guide. You mentioned Kurt, I think some efficiencies that you're getting. But are you under spending in any place? Have you cut back in any spot? A - Kurt Barton Simeon, this is Kurt. So, in regards to long-term targets in 2020. Our long-term targets anticipate that overall in regards to our targets of continuing to invest in the business opening 80 Tractor Supply stores, we can have an assumed 3% plus comp and see operating margin improvement. What we also know is in a year like 2020 where we anticipate that that number could shift below that, we can make the necessary investments in the business and we can actually -- we can flex and control manage the expenses like we did in Q4 to help us maintain that operating margin. In a year like 2020, if we were to fall towards the bottom end of that range, the team will be as controlled and nimble. And we've done that in Q4. And if that were to be the scenario, we would actually have lower-than-normal levels of incentive compensation as an example. So, we believe that we can maintain that margin. And as we grow the business, we do think the long-term plans continue to show opportunity to even have operating margin improvement. Q - Simeon Gutman Okay. And then the quick follow-up is on the pet category. You mentioned, you're looking at the data and you're retaining your customers. Can you talk about are you still acquiring customers at the same rate? I didn't know if you were careful with your comments because there is a change. I mean retaining is good, but are you still growing your customer base at a rate that you were before in the pet and Q categories? Thanks. A - Seth Estep This is Seth. Look when you look out at Q4, specifically in Q3 and Q4, the ability for us to leverage our Neighbor's Club capabilities has been really, really strong. So, we're seeing nice gains when it relates to acquiring new customers through utilization of that tool, specifically like Kurt was talking about a little bit in these look-alike. So yes, we see us continuing to go out and acquire market share and gain new customers through the category. Q - Simeon Gutman Thanks again. Thanks. Operator And next we'll go to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Q - Seth Sigman Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and Greg best of luck and Hal welcome to board. I wanted to follow-up on the comp outlook. I guess from our side, we're still not clear as to why. It's largely just weather and you're not really seeing any sort of change in the consumer. The comp guidance for this year of one and a half to three, it is below that long-term algorithm that long-term 3% plus. And so, is that just because of the first quarter comparison? Or are we missing something? So, if you could just add a little bit more context on why you're setting the range where you are for 2020 comps? And then I'll just have a related margin follow-up. Thanks. A - Kurt Barton Okay. Seth, this is Kurt. As we planned our 2020 year-end the guidance that we shared with you we look at all factors internal and external. Certainly, first quarter plays into some of that assumption. But as we look at the business we're realistic as to 2020. While our customer continues to show signs of being healthy, in 2020 early sign there's indications of GDP slowing. It's an election year. Those types of things we had to consider in 2020 that can play into the consumer. So, we anticipate with our initiatives that we've got good momentum, fundamentals are strong. We can drive in the long-term towards that target. But what we're presenting to you is a reasonable prudent expectation for comp sales in 2020. Q - Seth Sigman Okay. Thank you for that. And then so just in light of that comp outlook, why is flat the right margin set up for 2020? In other words, if you do think that comps could be a little bit more constrained than the longer-term potential, is there an opportunity to maybe invest a bit more aggressively this year? If you go back to past periods where comps were under 3%, the margins haven't really been flat or up in those scenarios. So, just love to get your perspective on that. And then just the gross margin you are guiding to an improvement any more color on that? Thank you. A - Kurt Barton Sure. Seth, this is Kurt again. And as we framed up the operating margin for 2020 trying to center around 8.9%, a number of the things that you mentioned is certainly a part of our consideration. As I answered an earlier question, we believe we've got the initiatives in place that can allow us to -- with profit improvement and efficiencies allow us to offset some of the pressures on the business, particularly wage pressures to be able to maintain that margin. In other cases, we have initiatives in place that help offset some of the investments we want to make in the business. So the way I'd frame it up for you is we've got a number of variables and levers we're pulling and allowing us to make the right investments. If the comps were at the lower end, we may flex on it to allow us to maintain around the 8.9% as well. So, we're going to manage this real time and we're going to work with the levers and flexibility they have. And I'll just point back to Q4 again and just show our ability to manage that and be nimble as an example. Q - Seth Sigman Thanks very much and good luck everybody. A - Harry Lawton Thank you. Operator And next we'll go to Peter Benedict with Baird. Q - Peter Benedict Hi guys. Thanks. Congrats Greg. And welcome to Hal. I look forward to working with you. A lot of mine have been asked here, I'm just going to hit a couple of quick ones. First, just maybe I don't know if it's for Seth. But the timing of the store within a store Seth rollouts? And also the SKU localization efforts, any color on how it's going to cadence in 2020? A - Seth Estep Yes. So first with stores within the store. I mean, you'll start to see those to come to life as we do reset throughout the year where we target key brands. So, it's our goal not only to build on that strong exclusive brands, but also make sure we anchor with the leading brands in the industry. And so as we do reset such as here in Q1, I mean, you'll see Toro come to life in the store as you're there. You'll continue to see Purina come to life as we do our feedback resets. So, those types of things will come throughout the cadence of the full year as we touch those planograms. When you look at localization and store, our localization, we just now are in the process of finalizing standing up our assortment optimization platform. So we'll be rolling that out methodically making sure that obviously we do that as prudent as we can. While at the same time when we think about localization, the team has been really focused on partnering with some of our key suppliers as well. So, you take the spring -- you take the spring season that we're rolling into here. We're going to make sure that we're set and ready to go to capitalize. So, partnerships we have with key suppliers such as ScottsMiracle-Gro, leveraging their analytics team, making sure that we have the right products and the right store at the right depth. That's another key piece of the localization that the team is focused on to make sure that we can capitalize on the traffic and drive sales. Q - Peter Benedict Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe one for Kurt. So look I know looking at the business in halves is really the way to do it for Tractor Supply. But as we think about the 1.5% to 3% comp range for the year, does that envision maybe any of the quarters being above or below that range? I mean, it seems reasonable maybe 1Q below that or maybe more opportunity in 4Q. Any color on just how you're thinking about it, Kurt, would be helpful. Thanks so much. A - Kurt Barton Peter, I'd say generally, there's low end and high-end across the quarters. And as I mentioned, first quarter is going to be our lowest, but nothing of significance to call out beyond that range of about 1.5 to three in any particular quarters. Q - Peter Benedict Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much guys. A - Mary Winn Pilkington  David, I think we've got time for one more question in the end. Operator All right. We'll go next go to Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Q - Zach Fadem Hey. Thanks for fitting me in and I'll keep it quick. First question on the profit improvement plan. How much does that come into play over the past two quarters, particularly with EBIT expansion on sub three comps? And then curious if you could talk about what's next for the plan and how you think about that 2020 opportunity to drive further productivity? A - Kurt Barton Zach, this is Kurt. On profit improvement in the back half of the year, as you know, we've been -- we've made investments in store in DC productivity, indirect procurement and transportation. In the back half of the year, the one area that really drove the key benefit coming out of it that would be the transportation side of it. We're able to jump on that early in late 2018. And back half of the year, as you know, we saw benefit from transportation. We're excited about the other categories, but there's been a balance of what we've had to do to invest to make the changes in engineered labor standards in the distribution center, we had to build an indirect procurement team and the work we've done to roll out all the tools and training in the stores. So the opportunity in those three other areas is now as we begin to roll that out and it matures and we train. So these are multiyear benefits that just early in their maturity and a lot of runway in those three other categories. Q - Zach Fadem Got it. Thanks for that remark. And then \u2013 sorry, just in the pet and feed categories just a quick question on your auto ship efforts. Do you think this is an offering that resonates with your customer base? And then just given the economics, is this an area we should expect to lean in on going forward? A - Seth Estep So yes, this is Seth. So we've obviously implemented some of the subscription-based services throughout the year. We see it as an opportunity long-term that we'll continue to test into and make sure that we do it correctly. So, you'll hear more about that in the future. But obviously the capability that we brought to life, we do anticipate leveraging as we move forward to make sure we continue to drive market share. Q - Zach Fadem Got it. Appreciate the time. A - Mary Winn Pilkington Great. Thank you. Yes, I'll turn it over to Hal now. End of Q&A Harry Lawton Great. Thanks Mary Winn. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. In closing, I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this extraordinary retailer. I mean what has made Tractor Supply is and what will continue to make us special. I believe our business is well-positioned across the retail landscape as it's a company that has a very clear reason for being and is relevant to our customers. Our commitment to provide legendary service and great products at everyday low prices will continue to be the foundation of our growth. I look forward to sharing more about our plans to strengthen our position in the coming months. Mary Winn Pilkington Thank you all for joining the call today. This will wrap it up. Marianne and I will be around if you have any questions. And we look forward to talking to you on our first quarter call in April. Thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply and have a great day. Operator And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I want to start off by recognizing this is an extraordinary time. First and foremost, this is a human health crisis, and secondarily a global economic crisis. We hope your loved ones and your family are healthy and safe. We're living in a generational moment that is unprecedented. Each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we'll respond. While our call this morning is about our first quarter results, we will focus more on updating you on where we are with the crisis at hand, how we\u2019re navigating the uncertainty and how we are responding to strengthen our business. I want to start by thanking the entire Tractor Supply team who has truly come together to ensure we are taking care of the health, safety and well-being of each other and our customers. This is our absolute, soul, number one focus priority. The culture and purpose driven nature of Tractor Supply has served us well in responding at this critical time. It has never been more clear or more evident of what an advantage this strong foundation is to the company. I'm incredibly proud of how the Tractor Supply team and our vendor partners have stepped up to every challenge.  Our goal is to make sure we come out of this pandemic stronger. Stepping back, let me share with you how we\u2019ve approached this crisis. As the virus began to gain traction in China, we put together a cross functional team that was dominantly focused on our supply chain. This team worked with each of our factory partners at a purchase order level to identify issues and coordinate substitution products and other merchandising actions that we needed to take to ensure we have product to support the spring and summer seasons.  As the COVID-19 evolved and it became more clear that it would impact the United States and our retail operations here, we chartered a global pandemic response team that was grounded in our previous business continuity planning processes that we had put together. This team is a broad reaching, cross functional team. It has been meeting twice a day, seven days per week since late February, that it\u2019s included not only the Tractor Supply team members, but also supplemental third-party members that can help us on both medical as well as risk and liability. They are empowered to move fast and make decisions. They have served as the central nervous system for the bulk of our response. As an essential needs based retailer, we are focused on being there for our team members, customers and communities in this unprecedented and uncertain time.  I'd like to take some time to highlight some of the ways that we\u2019ve responded to the COVID-19.  Starting on March 16, for our frontline team members, we began awarding appreciation bonuses. For example, hourly team members receive an incremental $2 per hour. Early on we extended sick pay leave by two weeks for both full and part time team members who self-report contagious flu or COVID-19 like symptoms.  We do not want anyone to come to work who is sick, and we've been very clear on that with our team members. If they're sick, we want them to stay home and get better. To-date we've had over 1,500 team members utilized this sick pay benefits. We recently announced 100% coverage of COVID-19 medical treatment for team members under the company's medical plan and we're also waiving cost sharing fees for telehealth visits. We've increased personal protective equipment for team members, along with installing plexiglass barriers at cashier stands in stores and expedited the rollout out contactless payment options. We embarked on our most ambitious hiring drive ever, with plans to fill more than 5,000 full time and part time team member positions across our stores and distribution centers. Since our announcement we are seeing significant increases in applications and hiring, and all time hiring week highs.  To continue to enhance the safety of our in-store shopping experience, we've added a dedicated greeter at every store to drive awareness of social distancing, monitor the number of customers in our store and provide additional cleaning support, particularly carts. We also have modified our store operating hours, and added a designated shopping hour for high risk in seniors 60 and older, while adding store labor hours to improve customer service and safety. We've added incremental inventory to support high velocity consumable skews that our customers count on us to have in stock, as their dependable and essential supplier. We also launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade to say thank you to our team members and customers. Over the first 10 days that our first TV commercial was shown, it was seen by over 2,200 times with the reach of approximately 700 million impressions, and then just last week released our second ad as a part of this campaign.  To support our team members and communities, we\u2019ve made a commitment of $2 million. This includes a $0.5 million of existing Tractor Supply Employee Assistance fund to assist team members most impacted by COVID-19, and $1.5 million for the establishment of the Tractor Supply Company Foundation, and this foundation will be committed to the growth and development of our rural areas with initial focus on the COVID-19 recovery efforts in these rural markets.  This is a highly fluid crisis, and these are historically unprecedented times. There are broad range of outcomes of how our business will perform in the coming weeks and months, depending on how the crisis evolves. We are doing everything we can to think through how the next several months will play out. We are leveraging our past experiences; we are leveraging numerous third party resources, all to assess the uncertainties and to take very calculated actions. Some of the uncertainties we are thinking about are how the macro economic factors will evolve, including unemployment and GDP, the impact of the crisis on consumer shopping patterns, the impact of legislation such as the CARES Act on consumer and small businesses, the degree of quarantine measures that may still occur, either in the near term or in the fall season, and then the degree of uncertainty in the economy for the rest of 2020, as well as the degree, the incremental cost of doing business as an essential needs based retailer in the current environment.  With these uncertainties we've taken action to increase our cash on hand. We\u2019ve suspended our share buyback program, we re-prioritized our capital spending and we\u2019re controlling discretionary costs, all the while maintaining our dividend.  Now let me talk about some of the other things we're seeing and experiencing. We are seeing significant changes in consumer shopping behavior, from trip consolidation to their preferences for contactless payments, to their preferences for curbside pickup, and home delivery. And I believe the crisis represents an opportunity for us and we are moving rapidly to capitalize on those opportunities.  We are reprioritizing our capital spent to reflect the changes we're seeing at our consumer shopping behavior and a few things we\u2019ve announced recently. Three weeks ago we launched curbside delivery for our buy-online pick-up-in-stores nationwide. At the same time we also established two dedicated parking spots at every store in the country that are for buy-online, pick-up-in-store or court curbside deliveries.  For curbside delivery, all a customer has to do is order online, when they get an email that says it's available to be picked up, they drive to our store, they pull in one of these two conveniently located parking spots, they call the store and then we bring the items right out to their car in a very contactless way. We\u2019ve seen significant increases in buy-online, pick-up-in-store orders and customer adoption of curbside pickup has been remarkable. With more than 70% of our recent buy-online, pick-up-in store orders utilizing the curbside pickup option.  To enhance the safety of the customer shopping experience and provide greater convenience, we increased by 50% our mobile point of sale hardware capacity in our stores. These additional devices allow our team members to do a number of activities, including line breaking, where we've got queuing occurring at our registers that conduct outside transactions that may be incremental orders occurring on a box transaction, order to help fill up propane and be able to allow the customer to pay right there, and they also allow us to execute curbside delivery. We've got an app that can fully check off the delivery, all contactless. In less than three weeks we expanded our same-day, next-day delivery offering from about 400 stores or 20% of the chain to all stores. This is a great example of how we're accelerating our capabilities to be more relevant to our customers. We realize this could become a point of differentiation for Tractor Supply and we move fast to capitalize on our customers\u2019 needs for delivery.  In partnership with Roadie, we had plans over the coming year to continue to increase the number of stores that are offering same day and next day as a delivery option. However, given the escalation of the COVID pandemic, customers demand for delivery services became more pronounced and so we responded. Together with Roadie, the team worked and we accelerated the ramp up of same day delivery across the remaining 80% of our stores, again doing this all in about a three week time frame.  Tractor Supply now offers customers the safety and convenience of same day and next day delivery on almost all the inventory in our stores, nearly 15,000 items that our customers need to live the life out there. This includes things like livestock feed, dog food, power tools, Tillers, Riding Lawn Mower, Chicken Coops and even more. They can order all these, have them picked out of our stores, loaded into trucks and cars and brought to their homes, all without having to ever leave their farm or home. We are now the nation's first major general merchandise retailer to offer same day delivery from a 100% of our stores. Overall during the pandemic, our feedback from our customers has been very positive, with improving customer satisfaction scores. When I am visiting stores, our customers share with me how important Tractor Supply is for them and their families. You can see it on all our social media like Facebook and Instagram. This upbeat customer feedback is very inspiring to the team and reinforcing of them to do what they're doing, which is service to our customers and take care of their team members.  To briefly touch on the first quarter, the Tractor Supply team delivered strong comparable store sales and strategically invested in our operations at the COVID-19 crisis evolved. Importantly, and most importantly, we were there for our team members and customers as the dependable supplier of needs based essentials.  Prior to early March we were on track for an estimated comparable store sales growth in the range of 1% to 1.5% for the quarter. As one of the warmest winters on record, impacted our seasonal businesses in January and February, as well we were lapping a strong 5% comp in the prior year.  Over the last three weeks of the quarter though, as COVID-19 rapidly evolved, we experienced a strong increase in our sales volume as our customers relied on us for the essential everyday products they needed in the face of this crisis.  At the last several weeks to the quarter showed, our customers view us as a critical need, as critical to the needs of their animals and pets, just as the grocery store is to the needs of their family. We experience strength in key essential categories like livestock feed, pet food, heating fuel and other core consumable products as our customers stocked up for their anticipated need. Our e-commerce business experienced remarkable growth as we move through March and that growth is continuing in the second quarter.  The importance of our store network is evident with the strong growth in buy-online, pick-up in-store and it's a more cost effective way for us to fulfill these online orders. This is another area where we're seeing rapid adoption by customers. In the latter half of March nearly 30% of our buy-online pick-up in-store orders were from new customers. Along with that, 65% of the orders were by customers that were using this service for the first time.  As we saw the stock up activity start to slow, our sales activity has continued to stay strong as we're now three weeks into the quarter. Categories that involve living a more sustainable life and enjoying the outdoors are experiencing robust growth. Our customers are engaging in activities such as backyard gardening, lawn care, landscaping, homesteading, fencing and backyard poultry, all these categories are strong and they are playing to our strength. From a customer perspective we're growing with existing customers, but also gaining new customers. Within our Neighbor's Club we're seeing existing customers making their first purchase in other categories, in pet food and livestock feed, poultry departments starting to cross shop like they have not before. In addition, we're reactivating members and we're experiencing record highs in our new customers.  In summary, the first quarter represented solid performance by the team and the second quarter is off to a strong start. I'm incredibly grateful to our store teams who are the heart of our relationship with our customers and our distribution centers who keep the critical supply chain moving. As we look forward to the reopening of the economy, I'm very proud of the opportunity for Tractor Supply to participate in the President's Great American Economic Revival Committee. It is an honor to represent the company and rural America.  Now, I'll return the call over to Kurt to go through some financial highlights and I will come back to share more of what we're doing proactively. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and good morning everyone. I hope you, your families and loved ones are safe and healthy. I\u2019ll walk through the highlights of our results for the first quarter and then share what we are doing to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 from a financial perspective. For the first quarter of 2020 net sales increased 7.5% as we had strong comp store sales growth of 4.3%. The comp store sales growth was driven by a 5.4% increase in comp average ticket, and a 1.1% decrease in comp transactions.  The declining comp transactions resulted principally from two factors. First, the difficult compares in January and February due to the prior year\u2019s strong winter selling season; and second, we believe consumers consolidated shopping trips in March under the current environment as Hal discussed.  Our average ticket was driven by strong units per transaction growth as customers stocked up for essentials. Commodity price inflation had a slight impact on average ticket as inflationary trends moderated during the quarter. As we shared previously, January and February in total tracked in line with our expectations with March up 12% given the stock-up sales we experienced.  For the quarter we had robust growth in our consumable, usable, netable categories with declines in discretionary, clothing and footwear, and to a lesser degree declines in our winter seasonal categories given the milder winter.  Big ticket sales increased in line with our overall comparable store sales growth. Safes, heating stoves, Tillers, Trailers and Generators were drivers of this growth, partially offset by declines in snow blowers and compressors. For the first quarter gross margin was essentially flat to prior year at 33.8%. The gross margin performance reflected a favorable benefit from transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. Our efforts in 2019 help drive lower year-over-year average carrier rates, as well as reduced average stem miles. Fuel rates were modestly favorable compared to prior year.  The transportation benefit was offset by the strong sell-through of consumable merchandise, which generally carried below chain average gross margin rates, and greater markdowns of winter seasonal merchandise. Including depreciation, amortization, SG&A as a percentage of net sales improved by seven basis points to 28%. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in comparable store sales, and a net benefit from legal settlements, primarily from the favorable settlement in the Visa MasterCard, interchange fee class action lawsuit.  Partially offsetting these favorable items, certain first quarter costs as a percentage of net sales were higher than the prior year. These were driven by approximately $7 million of incremental costs from COVID-19, such as investments in team member pay and benefits; the impact of additional labor hours, and supply costs dedicated to COVID-19 cleaning actions, and the charitable contributions through our Tractor Supply Foundation to support our team members and our communities during these crisis.  Additionally, specific to the Frankford distribution center, we estimate approximately 10 basis points of impact on SG&A as we had not fully cycled the opening of this new DC, until the latter part of the first quarter. All in, we are pleased with our performance which helped to contribute to modest operating profit increase. Diluted earnings per share was $0.71, an increase of 12.7%. For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $263 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling about $41 million.  As we move into the second quarter, demand for our products and services continues to be very strong. We believe Tractor Supply is benefiting from the favorable spring weather and the consumer trends associated with COVID-19. As a team, the stores and the distribution centers are well prepared for the spring, the busy spring summer season. We are focused on capturing current opportunities, while managing for the long term.  Turning now to how we are responding to the challenges of COVID-19. We are laser focused on what is within our control. We are looking to capitalize on opportunities and investing in the future, while balancing liquidity and cost mitigation. We're actively managing our supply chain and inventory levels to support key categories where there are strong sales trends. On cost management, we're reviewing all discretionary spending and reducing spending that isn\u2019t appropriate given the macro economic outlook. As an essential needs based retailer, we are faced with an elevated cost outlook for the second quarter in the range of a net incremental cost of $30 million to $50 million. These incremental costs are attributable to the appreciation bonus for our frontline team members, increased store labor and higher safety and cleaning costs.  As this is a very fluid situation, the degree of how these incremental costs will play out for the second quarter, as well as the second half of the year will be determined by the length and depth of this crisis. We continue to forecast capital spending in the range of $225 million to $275 million. We are deferring spending in certain areas, while accelerating spending in digital and other more consumer facing areas to capitalize on the trends that Hal mentioned.  In regard to our new store opening, we remain confident in our 2,500 store target and we are currently on track with our new store opening schedule for 2020. That said, given the practical realities created by the disruption of COVID-19, we believe there is potential for the timing of some of our new store openings to be delayed. This could push some store openings to later in the year or even some into fiscal 2021. Finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide more insight into our ability to navigate COVID-19 from a liquidity standpoint. Given our financial strength, we are confident that we'll be able to maintain appropriate liquidity as we manage through the current crisis. To free up additional equity within our existing credit facility, we executed an accordion loan of $200 million in March and just this week we executed a $350 million loan within our existing bank group.  We currently have over $800 million on hand in cash and cash equivalents, with approximately $165 million of additional liquidity available if needed. To further enhance our financial flexibility, we have also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program effective March 12. While our quarterly cash dividend is determined each quarter, we do not anticipate suspending or reducing our dividend at this time. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and the significant economic uncertainty it introduces, we made the decision on April 7 to withdraw our guidance. Once we believe that we have sufficient visibility to reinstate guidance, we will do so.  Tractor Supply successfully weathered business cycles over time. I believe our strong financial position will continue to serve us well in the future, and we are taking the steps to position us to come out of this crisis a stronger company. As that completes our financial overview, I will turn it back to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thank you, Kurt. Our top priority is the safety and health of our team members and customers. In the current environment, we are more relevant than ever to our existing customer base. At the same time, we are acquiring new customers and seeing market share gains as a result. We are taking this opportunity to invest in the business, do the right thing to support our team members, but also to strengthen our position.  It seems like a long time ago, but many of us were together on March 10, and during that time we share with you some of our early insights on the business and all those items that we discussed, all still are true and are very relevant and you've heard many and them sprinkled through our comments today. We will certainly be leaning into those as we make our investment decisions through the second quarter and the second half of the year. We are not losing sight of the long term.  During these times, we will focus on the strategic opportunities to serve our existing customers, while also expanding our reach. I believe that the strength of a company is shown in a time of crisis. I am confident in this company. We are navigating this one by leveraging our strength and pursuing opportunities that will help us thrive over the long term.  Tractor Supply is a very resilient business with a proven business model. In closing, my thanks and gratitude go to the entire Tractor Supply team. Thank you.  With that, Mary Winn we are ready for Q&A. Mary Winn Pilkington : Great! Christina, we\u2019ll open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning everyone. My first question is on thinking about demand, realizing and respecting that you know there's no guidance and we're in a fluid situation. Thinking about the stocking up in your business, maybe a hangover period and then some normalization, how are you thinking about it and can you glean anything since you have a pretty diverse store base? Yes, you're more or less open, but states have different restrictions and so maybe you have some insight around timing. But just trying to think if we're going to see some peaks and valleys here as we move through the next few months or quarters? Hal Lawton : Hi Simeon, good morning. This is Hal. Yeah so, maybe I'll just kind of walk through a little bit around kind of the three phases that we have seen in our business and then just talk about how we're thinking about it.  So, the first phase is exactly as you articulated. The last three weeks of March we saw substantive stock up behavior, material stock-up behavior. As we said in the month of March, our comps were 20%. For those three weeks \u2013 sorry, my apologies. For those three weeks our comps were 20%, the comp of March 12%. And that was really driven in areas like livestock feed and pet food and things like propane, these very essential almost grocery like categories that our customers rely on us for.  As the first kind of week of quarantine really took hold across the country, that first week of April, we did see some early give back across the hand, really more than just a few days. And then really for the full three weeks of April here's, as we said our sales have been very strong, and they've really transitioned from kind of livestock and pet food feed stock up, to much more the things that I shared earlier on around the life out here lifestyle; things from homesteading and fence management and fence building to poultry and chickens and coops, to sustainable living, to gardening, to landscaping, to lawn care, all those things are really what are driving our business right now, and what we're finding is that you know our existing customers are shopping, they are cross shopping categories in an increased way. We're seeing reactivated customers, customers that haven\u2019t shopped with us in over 12 months in the store, and we're seeing new customers in our store at an all-time high.  What I'd say is that now I'm going to transition a little bit on how we are thinking about it. There are a variety of goes-ins and goes-out that are impacting our business. And we are monitoring all the data on a minute-by-minute hourly basis to take very calculated decisions on how we're driving the business.  One big \u2013 in fact there\u2019s several factors, and I\u2019ll hit each one of them quickly. One big factor is the fact that 50% of retail is closed and so pick your number. Even if GDP is down 20% or 25% and there's a much smaller pie, but there is only 50% of retailers. So while it\u2019s a smaller pie, there's a bigger piece of the pie for those retailers that are open.  And how that plays out, as there has been a big category shift to spend during that time if you look at things like food service and retail and I mean clothing, and apparel and entertainment and travel, all those are way down, significantly down and I think there's a big, there's a significant out of category shift happening across consumer spending right now that we're benefiting from.  The second thing I would say is where our stores are located. I think you're seeing this widely talked about in media and you can see in the caseloads that are reported publicly, but we can also see in our results that the more rural the store is the better the performance of that story is, and as we all know just the COVID cases as a percent of population not as dense in those areas, and also the rulers of the country have remained kind of more so open during this time.  The third thing I\u2019d talk about is convenience. Our stores, both the format size, the work we've done on our website to create convenient fulfillment options and our \u2013 and the location of our stores typically with a very acceptable parking lot, I think have benefited us for a convenience and being an inviting perspective.  Now those are a lot of the things that are positive, some of those could have some shifts that go against this. I\u2019d say on the flip side, we are absolutely watching how are the reopenings occurring, how is GDP occurring, is consumer spending starting to shift as thing start to reopen and what is that going to mean for us. We are also just watching unemployment overall. We're starting to watch unemployment, how it might affect rural areas and would some of that rural benefit start to give itself back. Certain industries that are in rural areas don't reopen or continue to stay closed.  You know we are watching all those, all those nuances, very, very closely and I\u2019d say collectively up until now they've been very favorable for us, but it's very uncertain how they'll play out over the next month, back half of the year, and really until we reach to either a new normal or a vaccine and we get back to normal. But those are many of the things that we are looking at and a lot of goes-in\u2019s and goes-out\u2019s, up until now very \u2013 it\u2019s going our way, but we're being very calculated in all the actions were taking. Kurt, anything you\u2019d want to add. A \u2013 Kurt Barton : No, I think you hit that and we are recognizing that the favorable items and tail-winds today can shift at any one point in time and it\u2019s just there is a lot of uncertainty and that's, I think what's reflected in the prepared remarks and the release that we issued today. Simeon Gutman : That's fair. My one related follow up is anything to glean positive or negative yet in oil markets and you know you can understand the premise of that question. A - Kurt Barton : Yes. I mean this is Kurt. I mean certainly the oil market is a very fluid situation, so we're watching it very closely and right now our data is showing us that we're seeing limited impact or decline, but we recognize how quickly and how fluid this situation is. So two points maybe they give you on that, on how we're looking at it. First, I'd say we do anticipate based on the forecast and the fact that there is such a strong supply with a real softness in the demand for oil, that there's got to be some supply taken out, and so the pressure on that local economy will likely exist. We do believe though this is still somewhat different than historical experiences that impacted Tractor Supply like in 2016. And as an example, in 2016, we saw after coming off a peak, 1,800 rig counts went down to about 400 in an 18 month period of time.  In 2020 we're seeing that the rig counts have sustained over the last year, so around 7 to 900, a little over 700 today. Various forecasts show that that may be cut in half and you could be seeing 700 out of 350, so it's quite a bit different in regards to the decline.  The second point is just to remind around our exposure. About 10% to 12% of our stores are in markets where there's oil economy and historically only a percentage of our products have been impacted. So it's a percentage of product in a small percentage of our stores and we will be flexible and nimble in flexing in our product, but while this could prove to be a headwind in the near term, it again is a small percent of our stores and we believe that the strength of our business models needs base can certainly perform well in this situation. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck! Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Baker from Instinet. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Baker : Hi! A couple of follow-ups there and Hal, what a time to start as CEO, but I commend you on the job you're doing.  I'm wondering if you can quantify some things. For instance, the spread between some of your more rural stores or stores that aren't in at rural locations or even quantify April to-date relative to the 20% you're running towards the end of March. And I guess I'll ask up front to the extent that you pass on quantifying, although I think it would be helpful. I did want to ask about the cost. Why are we looking at $30 million to $50 million in the second quarter versus only $7 million in the first quarter, understanding that the impact in terms of the number of months in the second quarter could be longer. For us its only started towards the end of March, but still that seems like a big increase. Thanks. A - Hal Lawton : Hi, this is Hal Lawton. I\u2019ll answer the first couple of components to the question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt to handle the last part of the question. We're not prepared today to share specific numbers, but what I would say is we are seeing material differences.  First off, I\u2019ll start with all of our stores are generally kind of rural or suburban and we have kind of shades of grey even in the context of that, the way we evaluate and look at our stores. And I guess I'd say is, the more rural the store is, the better the store is performing, speaking generically, and then the closer the city is to an urban area, the lesser the stores performing, kind of speaking generically, and we can kind of map that out. We really see the gradients of their sales performance across almost any category and so you know as you all know, the bulk of our stores are in rural America and core rural America and so that is benefited favorably and I do think many other companies have been talking about a very similar trend.  And then on April to-date, I think what we just say is the growth and the strength that we saw in March has continued into April and we're very pleased with our April results so far. As we said, the customer's category, our behavior has changed significantly and in my view, in a very positive way, the category is demonstrating the essential needs in orientation of our business and into the kind of people's lives and their livelihood and their families and their needs and it's gotten very broad across landscaping, gardening, sustainable living, fencing, homesteading, home care, you know things that really speak to the fullness of the product offering that we as a business carry. So rural stores are very strong. April to-date continues the momentum from March and I\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt and talk about the cost, Q1 versus Q2. Kurt Barton : Sure Michael, this is Kurt. And in regards to the range of these additional expenses and the difference between Q1 and Q2, first let me just point out the differences between the quarters. You'll recognize from some of the business updates and releases we started to produce in the mid part of March and later that, the efforts that we took in regards to wages, labor and safety and cleaning began in those last three weeks of the quarter. So those expenses that we pointed out for Q1 were principally in the last few weeks of the first quarter and the expectation as we continue to do that and more just extends throughout the second quarter. Let me just talk about what these costs represent and then how it plays out. The bulk of these costs, about 80% roughly is labor related or benefits related and Hal spoke to much of those in his prepared remarks. Most of the remaining 20% is for supplies and safety and cleaning and how that plays out throughout the quarter or even in the second half, as I mentioned, it really depends on the extent and depth of this crisis, specific to Q2. The low end of the range assumes that these efforts play out through all of April and May. The high end of that range would assume that we extend all of the wage, the benefits or cleaning if the prices would require that, all the way throughout the second quarter. So that's a way you can think about the cost of how it would impact into the second quarter. Michael Baker : Thanks. We\u2019ll talk about a related follow-up with how \u2013 it sounds like some of the sales trends in April are strong, but different mix, so I presumed that would have a less negative impact on your gross margin. It seems like it\u2019s being less dominated by Q and more by some of these outdoor areas which I would think would have better margins than Q products. Is that a fair assessment? A - Hal Lawton : Yeah, I think that's roughly fair. The other thing I'll add is, and again you know we\u2019ll see how the next two months play out. But like most other retailers that are open, we have pull back on discounting, on coupons, on promotions, you know in the spirit of not trying to drive too much traffic on one day, driving queuing, you know just trying to have more of an everyday ongoing. Really what's the core of us anyway in everyday low price business, which is what we do well every day, and so I think you know we'll see how the next couple months play out and whether or not we \u2013 you know how we need to manage that going forward. That\u2019ll be \u2013 that's something else that you know it's part of our strategy we've been trying to implement. Michael Baker : Great, I appreciate all the time. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes : Good morning. I wanted to start with the Roadie Partnership, right. Clearly a significant accomplishment like to roll up the program in such a short period of time, but how could your same-day, next-day delivery offering evolve, right. As I believe you were or have been testing a few options over the past couple years, what made Roadie the right choice today and/or should we expect incremental investments to maybe alternative forms or options throughout this year as you test and learn from this initiative? Hal Lawton : Hi Steve, it is Hal. Thank you so much for your question. Hope you're doing well. Yes, to start at the highest level and just say our aspiration is that customers can buy anywhere anytime and get it delivered or picked up or shop with us in any way they want, and you know we talked a little bit about this in early March, in continuing the digitization and omni-channel efforts for Tractor Supply.  Given the COVID-19, you know we rapidly accelerated the rollout of same-day, next-day delivery and I'm just \u2013 I can't say enough about the flexibility and the speed of urgency and just to the implementation precision of Roadie, of our stores and our technology team to really get this executed in a really good way.  Roadie\u2019s been a partner of ours for some time. You know I have a really high regard for them. I worked with them when I was at Home Depot over five years ago now and they're \u2013 you know they serve a large number of retailers in a similar capacity. And since we already had 400 stores rolled out with them, from a speed perspective moving national with them made the most sense, and they do an excellent job. I've had several orders in the last couple of weeks delivered to myself, as have Kurt.  What I would say is though, we know that we need to have a best-in-class solution and that requires us to test a variety of options, and so we're in the process of doing that. We have the Roadie solution as they have kind of built out and is kind of their normal Roadie Solution in all of our stores right now.  We\u2019re going to take in a subset of stores. We have two different subsets of stores, each 250 in size, where over the next two months we will start rolling out some different pilots. One of those will be a dedicated truck and a dedicated trailer and a dedicated driver that are all owned and operated and staffed with a Tractor Supply team member. So that will be a Tractor Supply branded truck, Tractor Supply branded trailer and also tracked by a team member who will be responsible for the delivery. They also will work our stores to do additional B2B intercepts and to drive kind of that, you know that more sales force oriented like delivery model. And then in another 250 stores we\u2019re working with Roadie to replicate something that\u2019s in between their offering and what we're doing with our own branded truck to have a dedicated truck and a dedicated trailer. It expands the offering of products so that they can deliver, also slightly lowers the cost and that will evaluate those three offerings over the next few months and then provide a further update and then of course rollout the solution that we think that are most needed by our customers.  But again in summary, we know that this is where we have to go. Incredibly pleased with the speed at which we moved and we're continuing to test and pilot, to make sure we've got the right solution and at the end of the day we're committed to taking advantage of this opportunity, and as we get to our new normal and hopefully back to normal for Tractor Supply to have emerged in a much stronger place than we were when we started the coronavirus. Steven Forbes : Thank you for that. And then just a quick follow up. I think I thought you mentioned strength in new customer growth. I don't know if you can provide some color on how these customers, maybe whether its demographic or the baskets have compared to the average customer. Are they shopping multiple categories or just a few, and then you know a comment may be on the initial initiatives right around customer retention, as you think about growing your customer base. A - Hal Lawton : As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing unprecedented really record breaking new customer shopping with Tractor Supply and those customers are shopping with us, both on our e-commerce platform, as well as in store. They're leveraging by-online, pick-up-in-store curbside delivery. As I mentioned earlier, there's a large percentage of new customers that are using that.  But as they shop with us inside of our stores, they're shopping across a whole range of categories and you know whether it be pet food or whether it be a more sustainable lawn care landscaping type offerings, so we\u2019re seeing broad shopping behavior from them we're seeing them really engage in many of our new offerings that we rolled out in the last few weeks, including curbside delivery. As it relates to customer retention, you know I'm really pleased with the efforts that the marketing team has taken over the last few weeks. As we've gone in and put in a welcome to the Tractor Supply kind of customer kit in place and day one, day seven, day 14, what are we doing with these customers? How are we touching them? How are we reminding them that we\u2019re here for them? How are we continuing to engage with them, we\u2019re doing that \u2013 and we're doing that not only just in a generic way, but we're also doing it based on the specific categories that they purchased, and the way they purchased with us.  And so, if they bought online with us for the first time, that way we kind of say \u201chey, wasn\u2019t that great? Hope you enjoyed your experience. Let me tell you about some other things we are doing.\u201d If they bought pet food, were saying \u201cHey, thanks for buying pet food. By the way you can sign-up for subscription for us, but you also have a bunch of other categories you can shop with us.\u201d So really, you know textbook like, kind of new customer onboarding program that we've rapidly implemented over the last few weeks to make sure that these new customers are retained. Steven Forbes : Thank you, and stay well everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Hal, you laid out a lot of the macro and big picture uncertainties that are going to impact your business. But under what conditions do you think your comps will turn negative and when do you think that critical point is when you'll know. Kurt Barton : Michael, this is Kurt. Let me take that. Hal pointed out a number of the uncertainties, certainly the things that are favorable to the business right now and all the potential for uncertainty in the near term and even in the back half. The key factors that we were looking at and he mentioned those, we are keeping a close eye on unemployment and consumer sentiment. The timing and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis could impact it, and is there a shift to the impact on rural markets, and then weather always can play a bit of an impact, if you just threw that in there outside of some of the crisis type items.  And those would be the primary ones that we're watching. Most of those are tailwinds right now, and if those were to flip any of those or a combination of those could have that level of impact on the business. But importantly we're confident in our business model and probably never been more evident than these times right now. The strength of our model and being a needs based business in the rural market. So as you can hear, we've got a lot of confidence in our business model and our ability to weather those situations. Michael Lasser : Just to follow-up on the timing question. At what point do you exit \u2013 traditionally exit the seasonal lawn and garden category? Is it possible that all of that just didn\u2019t pull forward right now to this timeframe, because folks just staying at home and do have some time on their hands. And then as part of that timing question, there has been some massive declines in a lot of commodity costs, not just oil but across the board. When do you expect to start to see that deflationary impact on your business and what's the reasonable expectation for deflation in the back half of the year? Kurt Barton : Yeah Michael, this is Kurt. Why don't I first address the question on inflation and then I'll toss it over to Seth on timing of product sales. On the inflationary side of it, as I indicated we saw some slight inflationary benefit in the first quarter. In those particulars as you mentioned, we look at it similarly, there are indications in the near term on both oil and corn that in the near term there's more indicators of deflationary pressures in the business. And we would anticipate as it works its way through the supply chain, that in both of those cases we might start to see some modest deflation even playing into second quarter. And while hard to predict, if following all the forecasts in both of those categories, we would see that pressure may begin to increase a bit more in the second half of the year, and we're going to be watching it carefully. This is about the best we could probably indicate on prediction of this at this point. Seth Estep : Great! Thanks Kurt. Hey Michael, this is Seth. Michael Lasser : Hey Seth. Seth Estep : Hey! In terms of your question as far as you know potential pull forward and just kind of lawn and garden, you know as you look at the current consumer trends and the shifts in spending activity that Hal spoke to earlier, we believe that there continues to be a runway ahead of us, because not only are we seeing the strength of this among our current customer base, but this is also one of those areas we're seeing new customers engage at Tractor Supply, within some of the new brands that we\u2019ve launched, the ability to partner with some of our key partners in these areas.  We continue to focus on areas such as gardening and increase those hobbies over the last few years, basically going just over 400 stores in certain key live goods to now over 1,700 stores and then when we shift into the summer months as well, you know we believe that consumers will still be around the house, and we're really starting to pivot some of our merchandising tactics and activities to linking parts for center court, as well as go after some of these backyard activities knowing that customers are going to continue to be around the house for the foreseeable future.  So I'm really proud of the work that the merchants are doing. Not only getting products back in stock to make sure we can be that essential retailer for our customers, but also as we look ahead to the future months to be able to go where the customers are going where we believe the hobbies and activities are going to take place. Michael Lasser : Thanks a lot, and best of luck! Seth Estep : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the puts and takes with regards to margin given the increased E-commerce demand you're seeing, especially in light of your change to one-day delivery and increased buy-online, pick-up-in-store, and how do you think it\u2019s evolved as the year goes on? Kurt Barton : Yeah. Hey Kate, this is Kurt. In regards to the margins, let me just hit the gross margin quickly and then SG&A. While we\u2019ve seen strong growth as Hal mention online, he also mentioned a real strong percentage of that being the buy-online, pick-up-in-stores which does carry \u2013 which is really what the most effective/efficient way for us to sell online merchandise and not a significant pressure in Q1 one on the gross margin.  More specifically, the impact on gross margin, we saw about a 20-basis point impact on the shift in mix in the last few weeks of the quarter. So if you normalized for the mix shift in the last few weeks, the flat gross margin on a more comparable basis outside of that was running about 20 basis points up. That's about in line with our typical last few quarters.  From the expense side of the operating model, I pointed out the 10-basis point de-leverage from the new DC which we've cycled starting in Q2, and the net impact of the incremental COVID expenses offset by the favorable settlements were a few basis points. If you normalize that, SG&A actually, the seven-basis point leverage would be closer to more about a 20-basis point leverage on a compatible basis. Kate McShane : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning everyone. Could you talk about how the balance sheet might normalize after this crisis is over? You've built up debt, built up cash. Is that an opportunity then to perhaps get quickly back into stock repurchase or dividend policy? What might happen there? Kurt Barton : Yeah Chuck, this is Kurt. As we mentioned, we took some precautionary measures in this environment and in our capital allocation strategy, shifted our priority to liquidity in cash; that's the right prudent thing to do. The business is strong and as we work through this crisis and the macro economic factors and the uncertainties begin to become less uncertain and there's more normalized business, we would anticipate shifting our capital structure back a little bit more to where we previously were.  At this point we're going to emphasize for utmost precautions, just maintain a structure with additional cash. We believe that gives us a real strong position if there were to be a worst case scenario and I would not anticipate reengaging on share repurchases, while we are borrowed on these additional loans at this point.  So we could see ourselves paying those down. We have the ability to prepay whenever we want and upon prepaying down, we would re-evaluate our capital structure, particularly when to re-engage in share repurchases. Chuck Cerankosky : And finally \u2013 thanks for that Kurt. And finally, Hal could you discuss what categories are in the home setting purchase group that you mentioned? Hal Lawton : Yes. So hi, it\u2019s good to talk to you today Chuck. I would reference those in terms of those just things people are really doing around their farm and their ranches to just maintain and their homes. So we are seeing, if you think about in our stores if you want, fencing, T-post, you know you are looking at corral gate, you're looking at chickens, you looking at chicken coops, you look at the people creating gardens in their backyard and then buying the vegetables and the rakes and the hose to the tillers to create those. It's really just all the things that our customers do every single day.  You know they are incredibly and a terrible humanitarian crisis, but a byproduct of it is that you know families are spending more time at home and they are spending more time together outside and they are wanting to keep busy and we have really all the things, we are built for that. We are built purposely built to enable people to do those sorts of activities around their homes, their lands, their ranges and their farms and that's the sort of activity that we're seeing, that\u2019s the sort of categories we are seeing lift and drive the business. Chuck Cerankosky : Thank you very much. Good luck for the rest of 2020. Hal Lawton : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Christina, this is Mary Winn. Now that we tipped the top of the hour, with that we\u2019ll wrap up our call. So everyone thanks for joining us today. I'm around if you need anything and we look forward to talking to you in July.

Before we address our results for the second quarter, I thought I'd just step back, take a moment, acknowledge the environment in the United States right now. There's no doubt we're in a generational moment. Before the quarter began and for the entirety of this quarter, we've continued to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and really all that's come along with it. And then towards the end of the quarter, we've seen widespread protests focused on racial inequality in America. We're a purpose-driven company at Tractor Supply through all these times. We've stepped back and led with our values, and I'm incredibly proud of that. Been so impressed and inspired how our team has come together and responded. And in all situations and across all functions, the team has moved with speed and focus to address this dynamic environment while also executing and delivering on record-breaking sales. Start off by just talking about team member, health and safety. We've taken extensive and proactive measures in this area. Masks are required for all team members and customers in all stores. Each day, all of our team members take their temperature and go through a symptom screening before coming to work. We are in the process of implementing biweekly testing for over 500 team members who travel, and we will be conducting sample testing within all our DCs to stay on top of that robust large population. Additionally, we've arranged for robust case management to conduct contact tracing and provide health care support for all team members who are impacted by COVID-19. And also, I thought I'd add, where there -- in areas where there's been widespread community outbreaks, such as in Waco, Texas and Costa Grande, Arizona, where we have distribution centers, in those areas over the last 6 weeks independently each, we sent in rapid response teams to conduct facility wide testing in concert with contact tracing and case management. In summary, just want to reinforce how committed we are at Tractor Supply to being a safe place to work and shop and how committed we are to implementing industry-leading best practices across all parameters of safety. We're also committed to advancing a diverse and inclusive culture, built on our core value of respect. To promote social progress, we invested in a dedicated time of reflection for all 38,000 team members to discuss the importance of diversity and inclusion in our company. We did this team by team by team. Additionally, over the last few weeks, we published our first ESG report. We hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion, and we donated to cause of the supporting quality and strength in our local communities, and you can expect many more actions from us on the diversity inclusion front moving forward. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We experienced unprecedented sales. Notably, they were strong the entire quarter, all 3 months. We had consistent, elevated levels of sales each week, and we had record growth across all channels, product categories and geographic regions. Kind of turning to the numbers. Net sales grew approximately 35% with comparable store sales plus 30.5%, driven by a comparable transaction count increase of 14.6% and a comparable average ticket increase of 15.8%. Diluted earnings per share grew 61% to $2.90. And e-commerce saw significant growth, strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did in the quarter to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. Kurt will walk you through greater details on the quarter and our outlook and walk you through some more numbers here in a moment when I turn it over to him. But I thought now what I'd do is shift to some operational highlights.  During the second quarter, we announced several strategic investments in our team members who are at the heart of our relationship with our customers. Early responses to the pandemic included paid sick leave and expanded benefits and appreciation bonuses. Totaling -- the benefits and appreciation bonuses totaled $35 million in Q2. And then as we progressed through the quarter, it became clear that we were moving to a new normal, really operating for the foreseeable future with COVID-19, and I'll talk more about that later. And so consequently, we made the decision to permanently enhance our compensation and benefits, including wage increases across all of our stores and distribution centers of a minimum $1 per hour for all hourly team members. In addition to the wage increases, more than 2,000 frontline managers at our stores and distribution centers are now receiving annual restricted stock units with the goal of helping fuel their entrepreneurial spirit and allowing them to benefit in the company's long-term success. We also took the opportunity to ensure we're supporting the health and wellness of our team members. And what we did was we chose to offer health care and benefits to our part-time team members. We are committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Operating in elevated comps for 13 weeks presents a number of challenges. During the second quarter, we added over 5,000 net new team members, primarily across our stores and distribution centers. These team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated volumes. Also, to facilitate our distribution network's capacity, we opened a new mixing center in Florida. And also, we work closely with our vendor partners. They've been key contributors to our success and supported our supply chain with speed and nimbleness. We'd like to express our sincere appreciation for their collaboration and support of our mutual customers. Our focus remains on working together to ensure we remain in stock for merchandising categories that make us the dependable supplier for products that our customers need to support their lifestyle. During the quarter, we rolled out curbside pickup, same day, next-day delivery, relaunched our website. And in early July, we rolled out our new mobile app. And we've seen acceleration in adoption rates of technology initiatives with multiple years of consumer adoption being compressed into 10 or 12 weeks' time. Our e-commerce results were impressive with triple-digit growth increases. And this triple-digit growth increase included buy online and pickup in-store orders. This sharp acceleration in consumer shopping preferences is becoming ingrained in our customers' behaviors. And we're fostering this relationship in a digital way through frequent communications, whether it's digital marketing or in e-mail, and we're accelerating our focus on the transformation of our digital platforms and services. We have an opportunity to create deeper customer relationships of scale, and we're laser-focused on that opportunity. Speaking of customers, during the quarter, another investment we made was in our brand-building initiatives. Given the current dynamic, we capitalized on the opportunity to shift our marketing spend, which had been traditionally print media, to more digital and national TV. And notably, we launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. We launched the initial campaign in March during the early weeks of the COVID pandemic. And the campaign has continued to evolve. And what we're working on is matching the country's mood and the cycle of the pandemic, and we've done 5 different commercials in the last 4 months. Our most recent TV ad has been focused on reinforcing Tractor Supply as a safe and convenient place to shop for all you need for your summer out here. Our research indicates that our unaided brand awareness and Tractor Supply being in the consideration set for shopping trips are both increasing. More importantly, we had our customers shop -- we had more customers shop with us than ever before as we experienced robust growth in our customer base with increased sales across existing customers, new customers and re-acquired customers. And so what I thought I'd do is to share with you 5 kind of key observations of our customer behaviors based on the market data and research that we have. So the first observation I'll mention is we're growing trips and our customers are spending -- and our existing customers are spending more with us. Our core customers, our existing customers are shopping more frequently and their baskets are larger as we benefit from their trip consolidation. And these customers are shopping more categories from us than they ever have before. And we've finished the quarter with close to 17 million Neighbor's Club members. The second observation I'll share is that we're gaining new customers at the fastest rate in the history of the company. For the second quarter, we saw 3.3 million identifiable new customers, and that represents almost over a 14% year-over-year increase.  The third observation is that we're reengaging our lapsed customers, and they're returning to shop with us at a higher rate than ever before. For the quarter, we reactivated almost 2 million customers, which was an increase of 42% year-over-year.  The fourth observation that I'll share is that the new customers we're acquiring as compared to our core customers, they're skewing younger, higher income and closer to 50% female, which is an increase of 10 percentage points compared to our historical trends of 60% male. And the fifth and last observation that I'll share is that the new customers are becoming repeat customers at the fastest rate ever. This is at a time when our overall customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. We believe key aspects to our customer service such as being a convenient place to shop, a tailored lifestyle-oriented product category, our legendary customer service and our strong in-stock levels are important to keep these new customers engaged with our brands. That's what's attracting them to us. Notably, purchasing patterns for our new and reengaged customers are very similar to our existing customer behaviors and product category engagement. Looking ahead, we know our opportunity is to capitalize on these trends and to nurture these customers and to gain market share. And we have strong plans in place to retain these customers with marketing and product offerings, continuation of our national advertising campaign, but robust digital onboarding CRM tool kits are being executed. Taking a step back from our Q2 results and actions, I want to share broadly what we're seeing from a macro perspective. Key trends we're seeing that are working to our favor include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends; consumer spending shifting from travel and entertainment that kind of trapped spend is now being spent on home and land; and of course, pet adoptions, they're at an all-time high.  In addition, we believe our business benefited from the government stimulus and activity that helped bolster the economy. And while we're not planning for this government stimulus activity to continue, many of the other trends I mentioned, such as pet adoption and trip consolidation and rural revitalization, we definitely expect those to continue and to be prevalent with our customers over the next few quarters. Speaking of that, as we look ahead, we believe many of these consumer behaviors that we saw over the last 3 or 4 months are going to continue in the second half, but there's going to be some nuances and some differences. For instance, we expect -- we definitely expect consumers to still be [indiscernible] with their land and their homes. It is their safe oasis. But the things that they will do will be different. As an example, in the spring, customers were buying lawnmowers and kayaks and working in their yard on their fencing and their gates. And we think in the fall, some of that will continue, but instead of lawnmowers and kayaks, they're going to shift to buying things like patio heaters and firewood and fire pits, but they're still going to be working on their land and on their homes. They're also going to continue to do things that are more outdoor related, but are fall and winter oriented, such as things like raking leaves and winterizing their gardens. Overall, we believe there will be a higher level of category participation in the fall and the winter categories, just like there was in the spring, it's just going to be different, and it will be higher than it's been in the past, and we believe that's going to continue into the second half. Now looking at even further, while we can't predict the future and there is a significant amount of uncertainty, our team is operating under the premise that we will still be dealing with the pandemic in the first half of next year. We're buying to that assumption, and we're orienting our planning around that assumption. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. We believe that our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. We have an opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come.  And with that, I'll turn now the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give some insights on our strategic growth initiatives and other drivers of Q3. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Before discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to recognize and thank our incredible team. I have personally been inspired watching everyone come together to face the current environment, embrace new ways of working and decisively taking actions to serve our team and our customers in the face of unprecedented conditions.  With more than 20 years with Tractor Supply, I could not be prouder to be a part of this team. This quarter was certainly exceptional and like no other in the history of Tractor Supply. The second quarter benefited from the macro trends Hal shared with you. While at the same time, we had a great spring. The weather was ideal across the country with favorable temperatures breaking early in the spring and consistent moisture, providing a sustained spring/summer season. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the largest driver was our customers' desire for product categories that supported their Out Here lifestyle, as they shifted from other interests like travel, entertainment and dining. From home studying, land maintenance and fencing, backyard living and caring for their animals and pets, our customers have clearly made the care and improvement in their homes and land a priority. This is also inclusive of living a more self-reliant lifestyle and adopting new hobbies like backyard poultry, gardening and bird feeding.  Now we believe brand awareness and the new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was followed by tailwinds such as the favorable spring/summer weather that I mentioned earlier and the benefits from being an essential business that remained open during the early part of the quarter. Underlying these primary drivers, the government stimulus checks likely increase spending across the board in all categories. Now another way to look at this quarter's comparable store sales growth is to break down the comp between transitory factors, such as government stimulus checks and COVID-19-related sales as compared to sustainable, more structural tailwinds like trip consolidation, the increase in new customers and re-engaged customers, the rural revitalization trends and the growth in companion animal ownership. While it is difficult to estimate the impact from each of these drivers, we believe that nearly half of the Q2 comparable store sales growth can be attributed to structural tailwinds, giving us a sustainable opportunity for growth. I'll wrap up my discussion on sales with a few other performance highlights. First, we had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which was generally in line with our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by strength in mowers, trailers, safes, pressure washers and 3-point equipment. Second, our CUE products, consumable, usable and edible, which is a representation of our strength of our core business, had solid mid-teens comp sales growth. And lastly, commodity inflation was essentially flat for the quarter. Moving on to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 36.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 155 basis points. This increase was driven principally by a reduction in the frequency and depth of promotion as a result of strong demand for our product categories. We also benefited from favorable product mix, along with the lower transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales, was 22.3%, a decrease of 33 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs for the strong increase in comparable store sales. The leverage was achieved -- the leverage achieved -- we achieved in these SG&A categories was partially offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased store labor hours to support the significant increase in sales volume and increased incentive compensation given our strong performance in the quarter. We incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 pandemic of approximately $55 million, including the appreciation wages for team members, PP&E supplies and incremental store labor hours dedicated to managing social distancing in the stores as well as cleaning and sanitation. Operating profit increased nearly 56% with operating profit margin of 14.1%, an improvement of 188 basis points. Net income was $338.7 million, an increase of 55%. Diluted earnings per share was $2.90, an increase of 61%. Turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.69 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an 8.4% decline in average inventory per store. The reduction in average inventory per store principally reflects the robust sales trends and the solid increase in inventory turns during the quarter. Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter. To date, we continue to see the strong sales momentum in the business. We expect this momentum to continue, albeit at a lower level than the second quarter, as we forecast delivering strong sales and profitability for the third quarter. While we typically don't provide a unique situation due to COVID-19, we are providing our view on the third quarter. Given the level of uncertainty, it is difficult to provide guidance beyond Q3 right now. Factors contributing to a heightened level of uncertainty include the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the tapering of government stimulus benefits, elevated unemployment levels and even the November elections. With this backdrop, we would anticipate the strength in our comparable store sales trends to moderate as we move through Q3. Overall, we feel very good at about our business leading up to the November election cycle. But as we all recognize, it just creates a significant level of uncertainty for the consumer. For the third quarter, we expect net sales growth of approximately 16% to 22% and comp sales growth in the range of 12% to 18%. Net income is forecast to be in the range of $136 million to $162 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.35.  Two factors to consider that are impacting our outlook for the third quarter include COVID-19-related costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million to ensure the health and safety of our team members and our customers and $15 million for the prioritization of our strategic growth initiatives. And please keep in mind, as we previously disclosed, our move to permanent wage and benefit changes will cost approximately $13 million this quarter as well. We are raising our capital spending outlook to support our strategic growth initiatives that Hal will discuss momentarily. Our previous estimate was $225 million to $275 million. For 2020, we now anticipate capital spending in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology. Looking beyond the third quarter, we anticipate fourth quarter comp sales performance to be above our original expectations when we enter the year. As mentioned earlier, we expect the current trends to moderate throughout Q3, and we believe that moderation will continue into fourth quarter as our outdoor seasonal sales become a lower concentration of our business and we get back to a higher mix of CUE products. Additionally, we are planning for a more moderate holiday season than normal, but with stronger online growth. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage our capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing in initiatives for long-term growth. We are taking actions to capitalize on the opportunity to capture and sustain a greater share of the market. Year-to-date, we have generated a significant increase in cash from operations. As Hal will discuss in a moment, we are reinvesting a meaningful portion of this incremental cash flow into our business with the strategic goal of emerging from this crisis stronger than before. The team at Tractor Supply is excited about how we will continue to be an innovative leader in our channel. Now I'll turn it back to Hal. Harry Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Let's look ahead. Look, as we think about our business, we have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends that we're benefiting from now and to retain the record number of new and reengaged customers we're seeing. And our goal is to capitalize on our ability to drive sales and higher productivity. Our financial strength allows us to stay focused on the long term, creating an even greater competitive advantage as we're investing to fuel long-term growth. We continue to operate from a position of strength. And we're laying the groundwork for the future. And so today, we're excited to introduce 2 new strategic initiatives that are being implemented across all stores within the company. The first is the build-out of our field activity support team, and that's focused on improving the productivity of in-store execution. And the second is the expansion of several technology and service enhancements to capitalize on consumer expectations. Turning to the field activity support team. This initiative is designed to improve our merchandising activities in store, which represents the second largest body of work for our team members. This initiative builds on the successful rollout last year of The Tractor Way program, which addressed the largest area of work in our stores, the receiving and stocking of merchandise.  And kind of stepping back, more broadly, our goal is to improve the productivity of our store payroll. And we want to shift hours away from tasking to customer-facing and keep finding ways to be as efficient as possible in what we do in tasking, so that way we can drive customer-facing hours. And this is a very common retail approach. And so the work of the FAST team includes executing a merchandising programs like center court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. The FAST team, as mentioned, will allow the store teams to spend more time on customer service, help them improve their in-store execution and ultimately lead to higher comparable store sales. These teams are in the process of ramping up, and we're hiring more than 1,500 FAST team members with 1 FAST team per district. These teams will be in the stores starting in August, and the goal is for each FAST team to be in every store every week. And each team -- and the focus of the team will be to improve store-specific measures and address sales driving activity. Over time, we would anticipate that these teams will receive support from our vendor partners, which is common in the industry, as the work is directly related to the on-shelf execution of their product. And also the FAST team has the potential to help drive store-level efficiencies as the teams ramp up. This type of dedicated team is a proven strategy of cross-sectors of retail, in particular so -- and they've been proven to drive customer satisfaction rates and sales, and they'll allow the store teams to prioritize customer service and continue to drive productivity through your labor in the store to get very efficient on your tasking. Our second initiative is building on our technology and services capabilities. And this includes the rollout of contactless payment in the quarter, expansion of our in-store WiFi capabilities, enhanced ship-from-store online fulfillment and increased delivery capabilities. Within the last few weeks, we had a soft launch of our new mobile app that allows for greater customer convenience and integration with our Neighbor's Club. We will begin to communicate more about the app to our customers in the upcoming weeks. We know mobile access is important to our customers, and our new app makes shopping easier and more convenient.  In addition, we're expanding our ship-from-store capabilities. We're adding subscriptions at the point-of-sale in our stores and implementing contactless payments at the registers in our stores. Further, we're substantially increasing wireless access in our stores as we move from 2 access points in each store to 5 access points at each store. This is all tied to supporting contactless payments and our mobile point-of-sale hardware that we doubled the capacity of earlier this year. Our technology capabilities are becoming a strategic advantage for Tractor Supply. In addition to these 2 chain-wide activities, we are focused on driving our -- we're also focused on driving our space -- of driving space productivity across our stores. The first initiative that we'd like to talk about today is driving the productivity of our side lot. Typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have inside the store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through reworking of the side lot is in progress, and we're beginning some tests right now here in the third quarter.  In total, we'll do about 75 stores this year in terms of transformation of our side lots. And we have the ability to transform our side lot with expanded product offerings in select categories, enhancing the shopping experience of categories that are already out there. And it can be offered to -- it can be leveraged to offer a wider product assortment in select categories, enter new categories and also offer the convenience through the expansion of buy online, pick up in store and really what it will become is buy online, drive through for pickup. This transformation can help us continue to keep our customers engaged at Tractor Supply and take our customer experience to the next level. During the third quarter, we will also begin testing a new interior space productivity program for our mature stores. Project fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. Much like the FAST teams, space productivity programs of mature stores have proven -- have been proven across retail concepts to drive higher sales per square foot when deployed from a consumer's point of view. An active space productivity program is also important to protect the brand image of the Tractor Supply. Similar to our side lot test, we anticipate completing about 75 fusion stores in 2020, and there will be some overlap between the 2 pilots. Given the size of our store base, both of these efforts are a multiyear opportunity to continue to refresh our store base, create new shopping categories for our customers and further drive comp sales. As we look ahead, we have a robust new product innovation pipeline. One key introduction is the addition of power tools from Makita, a brand known for their reputation for high-quality power tools. In companion animal, we have a significant reset of our dog food offerings occurring right now here in August. This reset will reallocate space for winning brands, along with exclusive and new brand introductions. This will also allow for the expansion of our exclusive line with Miranda Lambert's MuttNation On The Farm and the addition of the Victor dog food. Our customers have been asking us to carry the Victor brand for quite some time, and we're excited to add it to our dog food offering. We will be the first national retailer of Victor. Victor dog food launches -- is online available today with a limited SKU offering, and you can start to see the product, and it's currently rolling out in our stores right now. Across all parts of the store, we had exciting products for the fall and winter as we adapt to serving our customers in the current environment. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we begin to move into fall.  On the marketing front, we're excited to announce our partnership with Turner Sports during the coverage of the upcoming restart of the NBA season. We will be very visible throughout the season with our Stronger Together ad campaign that launched on Tuesday. To wrap up, we're focused on our ability to improve the execution in our stores, enhance our legendary service and transform our stores to make them even more productive and more compelling to our customers. Product innovation and category expansions play a key role in driving our space productivity improvements.  Our technology enhancements and service offering expansions are reflective of the macro trends we're experiencing, and we believe this is a structural shift that will be going on for a long time. Despite the current operating backdrop in the U.S., we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply.  I and the rest of the team remain confident that Tractor Supply will emerge from the pandemic a stronger and larger company. My sincere appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 38,000 team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we'd like to open -- we'd like to now open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : My question is centered around inventory. Inventory was down per store, had a pretty strong flip versus your very, very strong comp. I know it's based on very strong demand. But how are you managing this? And how do you expect the inventory piece to evolve over the next couple of quarters? Harry Lawton : Kate, absolutely. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, operating at kind of 20%, 25%, 30% comps plus for 13-plus weeks puts some strains on the business that we've not seen historically and really proud of how the team worked through all those challenges to meet the needs of our customers. And inventory has certainly been one of those challenges. And we've taken a number of actions to lean into that in terms of increasing our visibility of forecast with our vendors, obviously increasing receipts and working very closely with them, and in a minute I will ask Seth to talk a little bit more about our vendor interactions. But what I'd say is we would like to have more inventory in our stores.  We would like our inventory levels to be -- in-stock levels to be higher right now. And we are working very closely with our vendors to do that. In many cases, we're selling product right when it comes off the back of a truck. As an example, we are I think the largest seller of stock tanks in the United States. We are selling close to $2,500 of those a week. Our manufacturer is able to make $3,000 a week. So as soon as we get a truck, they hit the floor or hit the outside in the side lot. And we've got will calls and our customers taking them immediately off the lot. And so, again, we wish we had more inventory. We're very focused on getting more in our stores. We're very focused on getting our in-stock levels, and we're working very closely with our vendors on that. And I'll turn it over to Seth to maybe just make a few more comments on that front. Jonathan Estep : Thanks, Hal. Yes. Kate, so as Hal mentioned, obviously, it's our desire to get as much inventory as possible and one of the things that the merchant team has been doing each and every day is partnering with our supplier base and what I can tell you is that our suppliers are stepping up in ways in which how can we make sure that we can get each of the products that we sell today, but also looking for opportunity buys. And the team has been really nimble in looking at ways to reallocate space in our center court to product that's available when things are supporting the lifestyle that is out there whether that be around backyard and activity and home setting, things of that nature. So really pivoting to new items and new categories.  And as we've gone that route, one of the benefits that we've also had is strong sell throughs. So we have our each -- our replenished items that Hal talked about. But also when you look at our drive-out programs as well, we're sitting on about 30% less clearance inventory today than we have -- than we were this time last year, just based on the overall strength of the business. So it's a couple -- it's again a couple fold. Number one is that we want to make sure that we can have that product in stock to drive each and every day bids for your own programs. But then number two, we also have seen the benefit of strong sell throughs, which have benefited in less clearance inventory, which has allowed us to go after opportunity buys, which are driving some significant comps right now as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Peter Keith : Great results, and thanks for the thorough prepared remarks. Maybe a guidance question for Kurt. Given the solid gross margin that you guys posted in Q2, could you help us understand the potential continuation of some of these drivers with Q3 and what's guided via strong sales backdrop? Kurt Barton : Yes. Certainly, Peter. This is Kurt. And in regards to gross margin and the continuation of that, I'll first start by reflecting back on Q2, where we saw several factors that were favorable and across the board very ideal, and we were able to capitalize on that. And our priority will always be to continue to gain market share while trying to balance good solid gross margin. So as we compare Q2 versus looking ahead, for Q3 and forward, we'll continue to stay focused on EDLP, which does support less promotions. As you just heard Seth mention, our inventory is in its cleanest shape. And so we anticipate some less offseason transition or clearance.  And then we did see some benefit in Q2 on transportation efficiencies. We think that will continue, but albeit at a more moderated level as we start to cycle some of the benefits in the [Technical Difficulty]. We anticipate strong gross margin performance year-over-year. The key drivers of product mix and promotional may not have as strong of a benefit in the second half, but we do continue to think that there's benefit from both of those and the opportunity we have with good, solid, clean inventory going into it. So you'll see from our guide that we anticipate momentum and continued year-over-year strong growth or performance in gross margin. Peter Keith : Okay. That's helpful, Kurt. And maybe another question just for Hal. The new customer acquisition numbers that you gave were quite impressive. Now that you're several months into what seems to be elevated acquisition, do you have any observations in recent months on the ability to retain the people that have come into the stores perhaps in March and April? Harry Lawton : Yes. So we're monitoring repeat purchase rates of all of our new customers and our reacquired customers. It's a regular muscle and analytical skills that we have set up. It was part of all the work the team did in Q1 of this year and into Q4 last year as we migrated the platform to Microsoft Azure, and we're able to leverage the analytical tool set that comes along with that. And what we are seeing is that we're continuing to see strong new customer counts, we're continuing to see strong reacquired customer counts and we're seeing them shop with us a second and third time at a higher rate than they have historically with us. And those trends have been very consistent from the early days of the pandemic up until now.  And as I mentioned, they've had a -- early on, there were probably slightly more rural. I'd say now it's -- or slightly more suburban. Now it's kind of moderating. It's kind of reasonably mix between suburban and rural. It does have a tendency to be a little more female, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And then online, whether it's direct ship sales or buy online, pickup in store with curbside pickup, does over penetrate some with those new customers. But they're giving us a strong customer satisfaction scores. And in their surveys, they're saying they intend to repeat shopping with us. And then in their actions, they are continuing to shop with us as well. And our aspiration is to invest significantly in digital and national marketing as well as specifically in the -- in our CRM toolkit to continue to engage those customers. And of course, that's one of the reasons we hired 5,000 new team members this quarter, net new team members, was to provide that legendary customer service that we're known for and ensuring that we can serve effectively the increased counts of customers we have in our stores. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Baird. Peter Benedict : So two questions. First, just -- maybe just on the cadence. You mentioned pretty consistent top line across 2Q and that that's continued in 3Q. So as you're looking forward, you mentioned expecting some moderation, which makes sense. Just trying to understand maybe what your -- what level of moderation you're thinking about there? I mean, you said in 2Q, you thought maybe half of the comp was kind of sustainable structural stuff. Is that a good benchmark for us to think about how maybe you're planning the balance of 3Q? And then, obviously, with some more moderation in 4Q? That's my first question. Kurt Barton : Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. Thanks for the question. In regards to the comp sales, I'll address the point you made on the second quarter first and then pivot from there to kind of help with the third quarter. We saw, while unprecedented volumes amazingly, consistent performance throughout the second quarter, all 3 months at a fairly strong elevated level. And even when we look at the 2-year stack month-to-month, just continue to show the consistency between April, May and June. And as I mentioned, the level of performance continues through July. We do anticipate that as with what we can see today and having a -- it's just volatile and uncertainty in there that the reasons I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we could anticipate seeing some moderation. And to your point earlier, I believe the strength of the core business is a good indicator of where we would see the third quarter and the last half of the third quarter potentially more falling in the range. So we're giving some prudent evaluation to some of the tailwinds that could have less benefit, causing us in the third quarter while starting off strong to really end in the range that we gave in our overall guidance. Peter Benedict : Okay. That's fair. And then just a question maybe for Hal or Seth. Just around the animal ownership trends, and you mentioned the dog adoption, but also I know the backyard poultry trend has been particularly robust. Maybe rank -- if you could rank order maybe the importance of those businesses within your overall animal business, you guys are serving equine, other large animals, so just so we can understand which are the most important categories. And then just what you're doing to kind of capitalize on that backyard poultry trend that's continuing to surge here? Jonathan Estep : Peter, this is Seth. When you look at our overall pet and animal businesses and talking about rank order of the two, I would kind of look at each of those a little bit independently. So for us, we have a primary desire, obviously, to own the pet customer in the rural marketplace. And a lot of efforts are going in place, whether it be on our pet supplies resets and continue to make sure that we have the product there as we're seeing these record adoption rates. The pet supplies business just showed incredible strength in the quarter. And we're continuing to see that strength. Obviously, Hal mentioned the pet food reset that's coming up as we continue to go where kind of the customer is going and where those trends are. And so pet for us is something we want to make sure that we look at that, whether it be on the tractor side as well as with pet sense that we want to own that category, obviously, in the rural marketplace.  Animal is obviously the other category on its own. And with those, obviously, it's multi-species approach. You talked about backyard poultry, you talked about equine. And the merchant team really puts together independent strategies to really attack each of those areas of the merchant categories. And as we talk about localization and regionalization, the animal side is one of the areas that we see some of the most localized and regional differences at times so that we can go after these categories. So the team, our feed rack is actually done on a store-by-store basis relative to the local assortment. And we obviously want to go after these things, and we're continuing to go after sales here.  Backyard poultry is something that we have seen some really nice strength in. And just to put -- give an example of some of the nimbleness that has occurred throughout the year, our Chick Days, what we call Chick Days, which is one of our big center court events in the spring is typically about a 9-week event. That event actually has not ended. So as we've seen the strength and the momentum in that category. The team was able to be nimble, reallocate center court space. Most of our stores are continuing all of that. And we'll continue with that throughout the fall, as we want to make sure that not only we can capitalize on these trends, but also be that dependable supplier as we're seeing new customers come into the category as well as current customers adding to the flock.  So pet and animal, both, I would just say, are going to be 2 of the primary pillars as we look forward not only this year but for the years to come to drive comp and drive the overall business. Mary Pilkington : This is Mary Winn. I am going to ask that everyone please keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up. We have a lot of people in the queue, and we'd like to be able to get to as many people as possible. So thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Hal, you've had a remarkable start to your 10-year at Tractor Supply, but you are setting yourself up for a tough act to follow next year. So with all these productive initiatives in place, significant amount of new customer acquisition and knowing what you know today, do you think Tractor Supply can comp positive in 2021? Harry Lawton : Great question. And I don't think I've got the crystal ball in front of me on that one. But what I can -- and I would acknowledge just the wide range of uncertainties over the next 18 to 24 months, but I'll reference -- I'll start by referencing what we talked about in our prepared remarks is that we're planning for the COVID-19 pandemic to be a significant factor in the United States and in consumer shopping behavior, at least through the middle of next year. And we're bind to that. We're building our assortment plans around that, and we're putting in place our operational plans to support that.  As we look beyond that, that's where we're -- that's why we're talking about growth initiatives today. We truly are focused on emerging as a stronger company than we entered this pandemic. And we're going to -- we're investing in things like our FAST team to make us more operationally efficient, we're investing in technology to make us easier to do business with, and importantly, we're looking at our format and our store and saying, how do we make it more productive. And for those of you that have followed our business for quite some time, it's been a while since we've gone on a strong space productivity improvement initiative inside of our stores. And we're very -- it's early days, but we like what we see in terms of the initial actions we're taking on the space productivity program, project fusion in our stores, and we're doing 75 of those this year. And then the side lot has always been a -- I think, by all accounts, a big opportunity for us. We've got anywhere between 15,000 to 20,000 square feet in our side lot. It's kind of concrete slab.  Typically, it just holds most of our agricultural products out there. And you think about a lot of other retailers that have a similar side lot and how much more efficient they use that. And so we've got 75 stores that we're standing up this year that radically, radically transform our side lot. And our goal is to see how those 2 different 75 store tests play out as we get through the fall. And then more to come from us on how we would expand that into next year and the years beyond. And like I said, we're investing in from a position of strength right now. We're not sitting on our laurels. We want to lock in these new customers. We want to transform our business, make it a more attractive company to retail to come shop at and also a more efficient retailer as well. And so at this point in time, I'm not sure I could predict the comp for Q3 of next year, but what I can tell you is we're leaning in to make sure that as we exit the pandemic that we've taken all the time we have here to make our company a better company exiting the pandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : A little bit related maybe for Hal. I wanted to ask you about the outside space and then the improving productivity. You're doing around $300 a foot, and I think that still includes your e-com. The home improvement retailer, you used to work at, does about $500. And I'm just doing this to illustrate the difference. I know you're not a home improvement store. And then Kurt mentioned some structural tailwinds. Curious if the opportunities that you're testing here to drive sales per foot are incremental or should we be thinking big? And any sense of where these store tests, where you think the store productivity or sales per foot could land? Harry Lawton : Yes. So we're not prepared to talk about targets and what we think our goals are yet. We've got these 75 stores in each of the pilots that we're standing up here in the fall. And as we get more data and see the performance of those, we'll certainly share that as appropriate. What I would say is both of them are -- both of the tests are step changes in the company's value proposition and in our format. And notably, in the -- inside the store, it's a significant step forward in how we allocate space, cutting in new programs and new categories and brands, more room for lay down areas to bulk out product and drive sales. And much more clarity around the connectivity of aisles and looking at all -- every SKU has to earn its way. Every program has to earn its way into the store. And Seth and the team have just done a fantastic job in leveraging data to really redefine what that store should look like.  The side lot is a -- it's hard to express [indiscernible] radical transformation. You were basically taking the 15,000 square feet that we have there now, shifting it over to compressing it to about 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 square feet through racking that kind of merchandise this product. If you walked our store, you'll see stock tanks, you'll see corals, you'll see gates. And typically, a lot of times, they're laying on the floor bundled together. We're now putting these up and racking. We're now merchandising that they're shoppable. We're opening up the drive-throughs with automatic gates that allow customers to drive through and pick up. We're looking at certain categories like garden. We're looking at feed and how you drive through and do drive-through pickup on feed. We also selected high-volume buy online, pick up in store orders, so you can do drive through buy online, pick up in store, you don't have to wait out front for it. We're dedicating staffing for outside.  We're putting new Theatro headsets in all of the stores. So that, that way, our team members can talk to each other and manage what will be really, in essence, move from a 15,000 to 18,000 square foot store to a 30,000 to 35,000 square foot store. The side lot will now be covered going forward, much like what you might see in some of the more larger mass and home center stores. So it is a significantly different store than it was before when we were done with these productivity program rollouts. And we're very excited about the opportunity. It gives us an opportunity to really transform the productivity of the outside to bring new categories in. Seth was very involved and kind of led our CUE transformation in 2009, and we think this has an opportunity to serve as another step change for us going forward. Simeon Gutman : And the SKU count goes up, Hal? Harry Lawton : There will be some modest SKU count, but certainly, those additionals -- that would be more reflective of the outdoor area, where we've got new square footage that we're merchandising. But we're still very focused on space productivity and inventory productivity. But there will be some add of SKUs and some add of inventory to support those higher sales volumes that we're anticipating. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim. Steven Forbes : Maybe I'll just put the two questions into 1 here. The focus on the field activity support team. I believe you mentioned 1,500 team members right organized at the district level. And maybe just correct me if I'm wrong here, that's about 8 to 10 per district. And then as we think about the funding for these -- some of your big box peers, right, have gotten some vendor support for these type of initiatives. Maybe just talk about your dialogue with the vendor community, whether there will be some form of vendor participation, either initially or after you prove out, right, some of the productivity gains and then just real quickly, right, where servicing versus tasking hours are today versus where you think they should be? Harry Lawton : Yes. So let me kind of hit a few of those. First off, we are working methodically through the core tasks that we put on our stores and looking to make them more efficient such that we can shift those hours to customer-facing. And as you mentioned, that's been a program that's tried and true and been executed across many other retailers very successfully. We started that last year with the Tractor Way program. That is our #1 task that we ask our team members to do is to receive a truck and get the product to the shelves. And we implemented with technology and with process, a significantly improved approach to that. The next biggest task that we had is the merchandising activity that happens in our stores, whether it's seasonal resets, End Cap executions, what we call FCIs, which are resets of certain categories at the completion of the line review, et cetera.  And that's our second largest activity. And as you know, right now, we use existing labor in our stores to execute that. It's again, tried and true across retail. When you could aggregate a team and have them focused solely on those executions and those tasks, they are efficient, you get more efficient because they're putting together -- they're doing the same reset across 15, 20 stores at a time. You also get more efficient in your processes and your systems to drive that execution, whether it's the way you build your planograms, whether it's the way that you load your product on the -- as it comes into the store on pallets and gets set aside, et cetera. And so we are very committed to just driving tasks down in our stores, making it more efficient and shifting it to our customer service. And this is all about how do we make our company more productive, how do we continue to make our company all resources count. As it relates to the funding for those headcounts, as you said, it is very common in the industry for the vendors to support that sort of program, and I was kind of implying that in my remarks because the activities are directly related to the on-shelf execution of those vendors' programs. We have a vendor conference in a month, and this is one of the discussion points we'll be having with them. And then also, over time, as our stores get more efficient in their tasking, I do think there's opportunity for our payroll to be more efficient in the stores as well. So in the long term, while we have some incremental investment we're making in this team in Q3 and it will slide a little bit into Q4, in the long term, we think this cost is transitory, not structural. Mary Pilkington : Operator, Carol, we have reached the top of the hour, but given the number of people we have in the queue, I would elect the call go for a few minutes longer. So maybe, we will move to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli from RBC. Scott Ciccarelli : I had another followup on the new customer front. Just given its importance, your ability to kind of let this year's trend. I was wondering if you guys have any data on who your new customers are and where they're coming from? In other words, are these customers new to the rural environment because you're moving out of urban and suburban areas? Or is it more that they're shopping at other venues and migrate to Tractor Supply? And if it's the latter, what channels are they leaving to come to Tractor Supply? Harry Lawton : Yes. It's a little bit of both, Scott. So we all read the same data sets on kind of about mobile data and seeing where people are in the United States, and you're seeing less density of mobile data in cities, and you're seeing more density in suburbia and even more density than past in rural. And when we look at our customers and these new customers and reacquired customers, we're seeing that. It's people have left the cities where we don't have stores. They're moving into suburbans -- they're moving out of the suburbs, so they're moving out to the rural communities. They're embracing the Out Here lifestyle some, and they're shopping Tractor Supply because we are that lifestyle.  And then for the customer -- but we also are gaining share with customers that are already out here, so to speak. And I think it's coming from a -- and it's coming from a variety of places. So -- and I'll head into the categories, just to give you some examples. So in apparel, where our sales have been strong, as we said, all categories were double-digit comping. We think that we are benefiting from trip consolidation there. Instead of customers going to a stand-alone apparel or retailer and they get about that 1 or 2 items and do they really want to kind of take on that kind of safety kind of element, they're coming into Tractor Supply. They're already going to be in there to buy maybe pet food or animal feed, and they're picking up their clothes while they're in there or boots or any other item that we have in the apparel area.  Then you think about pet, all-time high pet adoption, a lot of new customers in the market or maybe customers that used to shop for pet food in say Mars. Our store being 15,000 to 18,000 square feet with a big focus on safety, and we've been very vocal about that. I think we're a kind of convenient location. We're probably -- and many of our customers, in fact, our #1 customer shopping criteria when we do our survey results right now is safety and cleanliness. And we have leaned into that from our actions and then also in our marketing. And so we think we're capturing some of that share, where just people are more comfortable coming into our store. And then you go around on pet feed. There, we think we're taking share from some of our farm and ranch competitors, who maybe are having more difficulty getting access to product right now. As you all know, some of the co-op chains are maybe having a little more of a struggle. And we think this is where the scale of Tractor Supply and being the size that we are and the connections that we have with our vendors, as Seth talked about earlier, really allows us to stay in stock and service that essential retailer for those customers. And we've been very focused, as Kurt was mentioning earlier on, everyday low price. Our pricing in pet food and animal feed right now is as sharp as it's ever been. And then you go all the way around into garden. And we think we've gained a lot of share in garden this year. And it's been a great spring. But we think even in the context of that spring, we've gained a lot of share. And I think that speaks again to our format. I think the merchandising team did a great job setting ourselves up for garden this year. We are planning on taking a big swing in that category this year. And it really worked out well for us as customers said, \"hey, I'd rather really go to a 13,000, 15,000, 18,000 square foot store, where I feel comfortable going in, I can get in and out quickly, usually a standalone parking lot, not an overwhelmed parking lot.\" And the products that we have in our stores are equivalent to really what the other options they have elsewhere. So it's a little bit of both, new customers, existing customers, and on existing customers, I think we're taking it from many of the places you would think they would have historically shopped. The last thing I'll mention is online. We've been aggressive online. We mentioned the triple-digit online growth that we had this quarter. And we think we're holding our own and taking share online as well from whether it's multichannel players or from e-commerce only. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : And may I say congrats, great job of executing. My main question here, Hal, is really as we think through everything that you just said on this call, and there's a lot that you said on this call, a lot of initiatives. I think you were already planning on focusing on space productivity before COVID. So I want to understand or better understand what initiatives that you're talking about today were already in place before COVID? And what initiatives, investments are you making now that you're seeing how fundamental consumer behavior might be changing because of COVID? Can you kind of maybe parse those 2 things out just so we can understand the new things that you're putting in place? Harry Lawton : Yes, Matt, and thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say, 2 things I would say on that. First off, in March, in mid-March, when we had kind of our meet and greet up in New York, we did talk about space productivity. And I'd say that was kind of early days thinking, if you recall that we were sharing with you and saying we thought this was an opportunity and we were going to go start to take -- put plans in place to attack the opportunity. The first thing I'd say is just outstanding work by Seth and his team and John Ordus and his team and our construction team. We're in the midst of a pandemic, and we're doing all this activity to support our team members, all this activity to drive the business in the midst of it. They're also putting in place plans to address base productivity strategically and look out 18 months, 2 years, 3 years. So first off, I'd say we didn't really have a road map in place in March when we talked about it. It was more of an idea. And over the last 3 to 4 months, the team has kind of not only walked and chewed gum at the same time but jumped rope and pulled together what I think is a very compelling, a potentially transformative plan for the company. The second thing I'd say is we are leaning into those tests in a more aggressive way, given the strength of our business right now though we might have otherwise. We're doing 75 of each one of those stores, which is a pretty aggressive swing for a pilot, but that just demonstrates the bullishness that we have in the solution and also the speed at which we want to execute once we get the data sets out of the pilots. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of our call, and I would like to turn it back to Mary Winn for final comments. Mary Pilkington : Well, thank you very much, Carol. And I'm glad we were able to get a few more people in there for the Q&A. So thank you all for your cooperation. This does conclude our call today, and thank you for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter call in October. And I'm around along with Marianne if anyone needs anything. So thank you all. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And once again, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Mary Pilkington : Good morning and in honor of the 40,000 team members of Tractor Supply, welcome to our third quarter 2020 Enhanced Earnings Event. Thanks for taking the time today to join us and I do hope you're all staying safe and well. And on behalf of all of us at Tractor Supply, I also want to thank frontline workers around the country, including our own team members who work so hard to ensure that our stores can continue to provide our products and services to the communities we call home.  Today, we have a packed agenda. First, we're here to discuss our third quarter results with Hal Lawton, our CEO; and Kurt Barton, our CFO. After that, we'll be joined by members of TSC's executive team, who will go into greater detail on some of Tractor Supply's key initiatives to support our company's long-term plans. Following their presentations, there will be an extensive Q&A period when they will take your questions.  Our goal is to allow about an hour for the Q&A session and we plan to conclude our event by noon, Central Time. A replay of the webcast as well as the Q&A session will be available on our website at irtractorsupply.com under Events and Presentations.  But before we get too far down the road, I'd like to ask you to take note of our safe harbor statement. Please note, some of the discussions, presentations and statements that we make today regarding our business, operation and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In many cases, these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations or any of its expectations or any of its forward-looking statements will prove to be correct and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements are included at the end of the press release issued today and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because we use select non-GAAP measures to describe our business performance, we've provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which is included in the appendix of this presentation and will be posted on the IR section of our website as part of today's call. The information contained in this webcast is accurate only as of the date discussed. Investors should not assume that statements will remain operative at a later time. Tractor Supply undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this webcast.  Thank you for your time and attention. Now we'd like to share a video featuring one of our many team members who lives our lifestyle and brings the Tractor Supply story to life. Harry Lawton : Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. When I first saw the video that we just shared with you, I thought it really captured the essence of Tractor Supply as a purpose-driven company. It is who we are. It is what we do. In retail today, having meaning and purpose with customers makes all the difference. It is a pleasure to speak with everyone today not only about our third quarter results but also about our Life Out Here strategy.  We see opportunities to capture tremendous growth ahead of us. As we're in the midst of a global health crisis and all that comes along with that, we didn't feel that it was appropriate to do a full investor community day. Rather, it's our goal today to share our Life Out Here strategic framework and provide greater insights on our initiatives as we plan for 2021 and beyond. Over time, as the world normalizes, our goal would be to host another event in the future as appropriate.  Tractor Supply is well positioned to leverage our stores and capitalize on our omnichannel capabilities. We have a large total addressable market with an attractive position and are gaining market share. We're focused on operational excellence, execution discipline and making investments from a position of strength for long-term value creation.  We're on a multiyear journey to evolve the future of our company. We are thriving as our second and third quarter results indicate. And with the actions we're taking, we're committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to our more than 40,000 team members of Tractor Supply that delivered these strong results. This is a team that's been operating during a global pandemic, supporting recovery from multiple natural disasters and executing at elevated sales levels while, at the same time, laying the foundation for our future growth.  Coming into the quarter, we recognized it would continue to be a challenging time and our team certainly stepped up to the challenge. Through it all, the organization has lived up to our mission and values. And I also want to thank our vendor and supply chain partners who've done a tremendous job supporting us in this challenging operating environment. I'm incredibly proud to be a part of this team. The results that we reported for the third quarter would not be possible without the team's inspiring efforts over the last several months.  The Tractor Supply team has been fully committed to adapting to the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic. Our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. And we're committed to being a safe place to work and a safe place to shop. And we continue to implement industry-leading best practices across all parameters of safety.  Our team member engagement scores continue to rank among the best-in-class. We have taken steps to reinforce our appreciation of the hard work of our teams that enhance and build on our culture. We're also committed to supporting and strengthening the local communities that we call home. Before we get into our Life Out Here strategy that I'm very excited to share with you, let's cover off on some of our third quarter performance.  The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for Tractor Supply. Our results were very much a continuation of the trends we experienced in the second quarter. For Q3, we had robust and consistent growth across all periods, all product categories and all geographic regions. Our brand awareness campaign, along with our new customer growth, continues to be a significant driver of our performance.  Our e-commerce business continued to drive triple-digit comps with nearly 80% of our omni sales picked up in our stores. And e-commerce continues to increase significantly as a percentage of our overall sales, doubling its penetration year-over-year. The work we have done to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. For example, our recently launched customer app has had almost 500,000 downloads since our launch in July. For the third quarter, our business continued to perform at record levels. As an essential needs-based retailer, we are supporting our customers the products they need to take care of their families, their animals, their land and pets. Net sales for us in the third quarter were up 31% over last year with comparable store sales up 26.8%. Much like second quarter, we had good balance across both our transactions and our ticket growth. The top-performing categories were in our core competencies of pet food, feed and forage, agricultural fencing, poultry and bird feeding, along with seasonal categories like zero-turn tractors, outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden as we had an excellent extended selling season for these categories. And we had robust performance in our big ticket sales, driven by strength in zero-turns, safes, generators, trailers and front-engine riders.  Our CUE products, consumable, usable and edible categories, which represent the strength of our core reoccurring business, had comp sales growth in the high 20% range, an acceleration from our mid-teens performance in the second quarter. We're gaining share in these businesses and across the board, including pet food.  We continue to engage with new and reengaged customers at amongst the fastest rate in the company's history. On a combined basis, more than 10 million identified new and reengaged customers have shopped with Tractor Supply since the start of the pandemic. These new customers skew younger, higher-income and slightly more female and they represent significant incremental growth opportunities for us to unlock. More customers shopping with us than ever and they have larger baskets. The feedback from our customers on their shopping patterns at Tractor Supply include positive comments such as convenient locations, selection of products and most importantly, previous positive shopping experiences at our stores. Our opportunity is to capitalize on these trends as we look to nurture these customers and gain market share. We're working hard to retain these customers with marketing, products and service offerings and we'll continue to make investments to do so. Before we turn to our strategic framework for Life Out Here, Kurt will now take you through some greater detail on our performance and share our outlook for the fourth quarter. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal and good morning, everyone. I will go through more of the third quarter financial highlights and then come back as part of our strategy update. At that time, I'll share with you greater details on our focus to generate shareholder value. First, I want to build on the overview of our sales that Hal shared earlier and provide a couple of additional highlights. We did have marginal sales benefit from emergency response products as our teams work to support the communities impacted from multiple hurricanes and the wildfires out West. In addition, much like the second quarter, we had ideal weather conditions for the quarter also contributing to the comp sales performance.  Another highlight for the quarter is that we continue to achieve strong year-over-year growth in our private label credit card sales. The largest growth in our PLCC tender came from standard financing while also seeing strength in our big ticket sales. We continue to see strong growth in this program, providing us the confidence that our 5% reward program is resonating with our customers. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 36.4% in the third quarter. That's an increase of 138 basis points. This increase was driven principally by a reduction in frequency and depth of promotions and a lower level of clearance, both of them as a result of strong demand for our product categories and our focus on everyday low price. We also benefited from lower transportation costs as a percentage of net sales as most of our cost inputs were favorable to the prior year, such as domestic carrier costs, imports and fuel costs. We did begin to see a meaningful shift in the domestic and import carrier costs beginning in the third quarter, which will begin to flow through the P&L during the fourth quarter. And I'll speak to that in a bit later.  Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 30.7% compared to the prior year's third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses improved 14 basis points. The robust comp sales performance drove over 250 basis points of leverage in our core SG&A expenses, inclusive of the permanent wage and benefit increases effective in July of this year.  Now the strong leverage was partially offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; investments in strategic initiatives, including incremental advertising initiatives; and increased incentive compensation, with the majority of that incentive compensation for the benefit of the frontline store teams, given the record sales and profit performance in the quarter. The incremental costs related to COVID-19 pandemic was in line with our expectations, albeit at the higher end of the range and it included additional labor hours and supply costs dedicated to the cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of our team members and our customers. The 3 incremental cost factors I just pointed out represented the vast majority of the offset to the 250 basis points of leverage.  Turning to profitability. Our operating profit dollars increased $90.4 million over the prior year, with operating profit margin of 9.7%, an improvement of 152 basis points. Net income was $190.6 million, an increase of 56%. Diluted EPS was $1.62, an increase of nearly 59%. When I come back up later in the event, I'll give you a greater perspective on our cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation priorities, all of which builds on the current strength and health of our balance sheet.  Moving now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, our view assumes no significant worsening of the pandemic or any dramatic reclosing of the economy. To date, we continue to see the strong sales momentum in the business. We expect this momentum to continue, albeit at a lower level than the third quarter as we forecast delivering strong sales and profitability for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe it's always better to look at our business by the halves of the year. Due to the unique situation related to COVID-19, we are providing our view on the fourth quarter similar to how we did last quarter. Factors contributing to a heightened level of uncertainty include the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the potential for incremental government stimulus benefits, elevated unemployment levels and the November elections.  Additionally, the fourth quarter is sensitive to shifts in weather trends and seasonal holiday shopping patterns. With this backdrop, we would anticipate the strength in our comparable sales trends to moderate as we move through the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and comp sales growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Net income is forecasted to be in the range of $163 million to $175 million and diluted EPS of $1.37 to $1.47. We anticipate gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of flat to a modest increase compared to the prior year.  There are three factors driving the shift from the more favorable trends of the 2 most recent quarters. One, we are cycling strong prior year gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which benefited from strong direct margin performance as our merchant teams partnered with our vendors on achieving a solid overall landed margin. And then two, we anticipate the transportation cost to be higher as a percentage of sales due to rising costs in both domestic and import transportation and along with that, higher seasonal surcharges for small package parcels related to our strong and growing e-commerce business. And then three, in comparison to the previous 2 quarters, we are planning more promotional events during this always-promotional-holiday-shopping season.  In regards to SG&A, there are 2 incremental costs to the business factored into our guidance. First, the COVID-19-related costs of approximately $17 million to $20 million to ensure the health and safety of our team members and customers; and then second, an incremental $12 million to $15 million for the prioritization of our strategic growth initiatives. And as a reminder, consistent with our third quarter, our move to permanent wage and benefit changes will represent an incremental $13 million in the quarter. And for modeling purposes, as a percentage of sales, we estimate 40 to 50 basis points impact from incremental incentive compensation based on the strong performance of the quarter and the full year. Lastly, we are forecasting our net income growth for the quarter to be generally in line with the sales growth.  To wrap up, our recent results reinforce the confidence and optimism of our future. We are moving fast to capitalize on the exciting opportunities we see ahead of us. I look forward to coming back here to discuss with you our plans for delivering sustainable shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Hal. Harry Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. We've been operating in this challenging environment for more than seven months now and our team continues to show great resilience, determination and commitment. Once again, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the remarkable performance across the entire Tractor Supply team. Thank you. Mary Pilkington : Thank you, Hal and Kurt. I believe that our results year-to-date create an environment where we can continue to strengthen and grow our business well into the future. Now let's turn our focus to our Life Out Here strategy. This approach builds on Tractor Supply's strong heritage of over 80 years as a dependable and convenient supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. Hal will now share more details around the strategy and his insights. Harry Lawton : For the next hour or so, you'll hear from myself, John Ordus, Seth Estep, Rob Mills and Kurt Barton on our Life Out Here strategy. As mentioned, these presentations will be followed by Q&A. All right. So let's jump into it. Tractor Supply has a strong heritage of being the dependable and convenient supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. We are a purpose-driven company. We're deeply rooted in our mission and values. We have a resilient business model and a track record of performance. And importantly, we see an exciting future with compelling opportunities for growth and value creation. We're an integral part of our customers' lives. We equip a way of life, a way of life that we respect, love and often live ourselves. We serve the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers as well as those who simply enjoy the rural lifestyle.  We have a diversified retail footprint of over 1,900 stores across 49 states. Our footprint is a competitive advantage for us and it allows us to address the needs of our customers better than anyone else in this fragmented market. Our size also allows us to have strong relationships with our vendor partners and to efficiently invest in technology and supply chain infrastructure.  One of our special sauces is our ability to leverage this footprint and while being nationally strong, also being able to tailor to the needs of our local community. Our culture is a competitive advantage. Our mission is work hard, have fun and make money. This mission is supported by 10 values. Combined, they serve as the underpinning of our culture and guiding principles for how we conduct our business.  Our focus on Life Out Here, in combination with our culture and our store footprint, has been our foundation for our business model. This business model has proven to be very resilient as we're needs-based and demand-driven. This has allowed us to expand from 200 stores to over 1,900 stores in the last 20 years, with trailing 12 months' revenue nearing $10 billion. We have consistently delivered strong results over the last decade. We have a track record of positive traffic and same-store sales growth. We've generated strong free cash flow while maintaining a discipline on the use of financial leverage. We are strongly committed to environmental sustainability efforts. This is important to our team members, our customers, the communities we call home and our investors.  As an example, we've saved 138 million kilowatt hours since 2013 and we've recycled 3.3 million wood pallets last year. In 2018, we announced our goal to reduce carbon emissions from our facilities by 25% by 2025 and we've made great progress towards achieving that goal. We are also a strong proponent of diversity, equality and inclusion in our workforce with over 49% of our team members being female. We also published our first ever ESG tearsheet this year, along with completing our inaugural submission to CDP in August. And hopefully, you all saw our announcement last week that Tractor Supply was designated as a Great Place to Work.  We compete in an attractive market that is benefiting from numerous tailwinds. Consumers have always invested in their homes and they are doing so now like never before. Pet ownership is at an all-time high and pets have evolved into a true family member. Also, we've seen the migration of the United States population out of dense urban areas, out into the rural and suburbs of America and home-standing activities and self-reliance are very much in vogue. And additionally, because of our lifestyle and our 15,500-square foot format, we are also benefiting from trends like trip consolidation. As we look ahead, we see significant opportunities for growth and we're committed to investing to gain share and create value in a large, relatively fragmented market. We estimate that our total addressable market to be nearly $110 billion and we believe that our share to be approximately 10%. And this provides a significant upside potential to expand our share of this large market. To capture this growth, we'll continue to invest in new stores with a target of 75 to 80 stores per year. We feel very good about our long-term market potential for 2,500 Tractor Supply stores. Our new store economics continue to be strong with robust returns. The other way we'll grow is investment in our Life Out Here strategy. We are all about the Out Here lifestyle and our strategy is being focused on being an integral part of our customers' lives. And there are 5 pillars to this strategy. The first is deliver legendary customer service. The second is to advance our ONETractor capabilities. The third is to operate The Tractor Way. The fourth is to go the country mile for our team and the fifth is to generate healthy shareholder return. So let's review them in a little more detail.  First, delivering legendary service is a core component of our mission. This strategic component includes activities such as our brand campaign, CRM activities and the evolution of our Neighbor's Club. The objective of this pillar is to expand and deepen our customer base.  Second, advance our ONETractor capabilities. We launched our ONETractor strategy in 2017 and have made significant progress since. And you'll hear later from Rob Mills on our actions in this area, which includes our mobile app, omni fulfillment options and website enhancements. The objective of this pillar is to ensure that our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations. Excellence in operations has always been a hallmark of Tractor Supply and we call this The Tractor Way, our third pillar. The 3 main areas of focus for this pillar are space productivity, store labor productivity and supply chain capabilities. And you'll hear more from Seth on Project Fusion and our store remodels and on our Side Lot Transformation. And from John, he's going to share with you some insights on our FAST initiative and how we're using it to drive labor productivity.  Our fourth strategy is that we go the country mile for our team. Our team members are a source of competitive advantage for us. We have a highly passionate and engaged team. In many instances, we hire our customers who bring their lifestyle expertise to work every day. And we continue to invest in our team members, their well-being and their workplace experience. We're committed to a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace. We have industry-leading store and DC manager retention. We provide significant opportunities for growth for our team members.  And finally, our last pillar. It's our goal to generate healthy shareholder return. Given our strong financial performance and resources, we'll continue to make investments that you'll hear about today to grow our business. We believe we can set an even stronger foundation that will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger with the goal of generating healthy shareholder return. We believe our key strategic initiatives will be meaningfully accretive to our financial profile. And you'll hear more detail from Kurt later on how the Life Out Here strategy purposely aligns our business and our financial strategy.  The leadership that drives the execution of these 5 pillars is an experienced management team with a strong track record in retail. Kurt, Seth, John and Ben, they bring 65 years of experience with Tractor Supply. And we've got Rob, Christi and Colin, they each have 5 years of Tractor Supply but bringing experience from Ulta and Home Depot and Target. And Melissa Kersey recently joined us as our CHRO after experiences at Walmart and McDonald's. I've never been more excited to be part of such a dynamic team who will lead our strategy in the years to come.  To wrap up, Tractor Supply has a resilient business model with a differentiated and loyal and growing customer base. We are moving at a fast pace. With our Life Out Here strategy, we're creating Tractor Supply 2.0 to ensure we continue as a strong, relevant company for the future. Now is the time for us to invest as we look to drive sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders. Mary Pilkington : Thank you, Hal. For more details on how we're executing the Life Out Here strategy, let's hear from our deep and experienced executive team. First up, Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, Seth Estep. Seth will share some exciting developments within our product portfolio and provide updates on several initiatives focused on driving productivity of the space inside and outside of our stores. Seth Estep : Thank you, Mary Winn and hello, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to share with you some of the key merchandising initiatives to drive sustained top and bottom line performance. We believe we have a significant opportunity to add science, enhanced analytics and category expansions to drive sales and become an even more integral part of the Out Here lifestyle.  Specifically, as we look to drive consistent mid-single-digit comp sales, a maniacal focus must be given to driving space productivity. As you can see when looking at the productivity of our stores versus other retailers in the peer group, we believe we have considerable opportunity to close the gap and we have several key initiatives that we'd like to share with you today on how we can shift these metrics up and to the right.  At Tractor Supply, we have a lot of exciting merchandising programs in the works, but there are 3 initiatives I want to highlight for you today that we believe will help drive our space productivity in our stores. First, we recently implemented new technology that dramatically enhances our ability to leverage AI and data analytics to optimize our product assortments and meet the local and regional needs of our customers. This technology unlocks vast amounts of data and insights to help us make decisions at both the store, category and SKU level.  Second is Project Fusion, tractor Supply's first true remodel program that will help enhance our customer shopping experience, drive convenience and bring forth our latest merchandising initiatives to our existing store base. And third, we have our Side Lot Transformation project that we believe is a significant opportunity to grow sales, increase trips and improve convenience by leveraging our outdoor selling space to live up to our commitment to have everything our customers need to live Life Out Here. Through these initiatives, we believe we will grow sales per square foot, increase market share, improve customer retention and acquisition as well as grow the market basket and profitability. I'm excited to share with you more about these programs today.  We have completed several technology and analytic initiatives that will drive space productivity across all 1,900-plus stores. First, we are currently implementing our new channel-clustering and assortment-optimization tools. These new tools will elevate the way we allocate product in space as we blend science with the art of merchandising. These systems take into account a wide range of data sources and combines them with the overall merchant product strategies to generate optimal product recommendations. We believe these new capabilities will result in growing market share, achieving higher profit margins with improved inventory precision and supporting more regional and localized assortments to be the dependable supplier for our customers, all of which will drive greater sales per foot and store productivity.  For instance, the seasonal division store-clustering example combines stores with similar customer demographics, POS purchasing data and other data points to optimize our seasonal product assortment to fit what they need. This data tells us that group one, in this example, primarily dominant in the Deep South, aligns with the Pastoral Pride Mosaic, a proud working-class customer who lives in rural communities. The data tells us that key product categories for this group are tractor and riders, rec vehicles and tractor maintenance. So using this information, we will tailor the seasonal assortment in these group 1 stores to meet those customers' needs to drive sales and enhance productivity. Our goal is to be locally great and nationally strong by optimizing our use of space and localizing our product assortments to meet the market needs.  Project Fusion is our second primary initiative to drive space productivity. With Project Fusion, our goal is to remodel our existing store base, bringing programs to life with new fixtures, layouts and products that truly enhance the customer shopping experience. The site-level space is analyzed category by category and reallocated as needed to align with current merchandising strategies and to drive space productivity. When reviewing the age distribution of our current store portfolio, we believe we have an opportunity to roll out Project Fusion across 60% to 70% of our store base over time. In addition to these remodels, we will continue to implement our best-in-class merchandising programs to non-Fusion stores through product resets as well as new store openings. By the end of 2020, our target is to roll out Project Fusion to 75 stores and we plan to accelerate this initiative to 150 to 200 stores next year.  Our third major space productivity initiative is our Side Lot Transformation. Many of our stores have an equivalent amount of outdoor selling space as they do inside. For years, we've used our side lot primarily for fencing, other ag supplies as well as storage. By refixturing the products currently in the side lot, we can maintain our current outdoor assortment and add significantly more products in categories that are meaningful for our customers to care for their home and their land. Our goal is to leverage this underutilized outdoor space to be the Out Here lawn and garden authority and to enhance our relationship with our customers to be the indispensable supplier for the lifestyle they choose to live.  There are several ways that we're going to leverage this outdoor space. We're excited to build out a 4,000- to 5,000-square foot garden center in our side lots. Based on our customer research, outdoor lawn and garden is the #1 category that our customer base plays in that we currently aren't a destination for. We are implementing a drive-through pickup lane for our buy online, pick up at store orders to give new and existing customers the convenience in picking up their feed on the go and giving them that contactless customer experience.  This Side Lot Transformation will enable us to become the Out Here lawn and garden authority. By the end of 2020, our target is to transform the side lots of 55 to 65 stores, either completely or under final construction, as we enter 2021. And we plan to accelerate this initiative to an additional 150 to 200 stores next year. We will also start to open up new stores with our new side lot prototype in the back half of 2021. We've already identified growers that could support more than 75% of our current store base. And over time, we anticipate transforming the side lot in 60% to 70% of our stores.  Now that you know a little bit about these initiatives, I'm going to take you on a really quick tour of our Fusion and Side Lot Transformation that we recently completed at our Rome, Georgia store. The Rome store is representative of a typical store for our chain with around 15,500 square feet of indoor selling space and also an attached side lot with an equivalent amount of selling space. This store opened up in 2005 and as you can see, it has an opportunity to improve how we are presenting the brand to our customers. Over the next few minutes, I'm going to take you on that virtual tour and walk you through several of the updates to improve the brand experience and drive space productivity.  It all starts when a customer enters our store. At Tractor Supply, we want everyone to feel welcomed and really connect to the Out Here lifestyle. We want it to be an inviting experience with open sight lines across the store and one of the big changes of this layout involves creating one central customer service and checkout hub that shoppers can really use as the heart and soul of our store.  When you move to apparel, we've reallocated merchandising space to bring in new brands like Columbia, expand winning brands like Carhartt in area, particularly in women's. The apparel area has a fresh new appearance and layout. Next up is tool, truck and hardware. Like apparel, we created store-within-a-store expansions, utilize their air rights with new fixtures, completely retumble the adjacencies and category space to improve productivity. We know we have an opportunity to grow market share in tools and DIY. And with these changes, we're also introducing brands such as Makita that resonate with our customers and their lifestyle.  In our updated feed area, customers can shop by species, whether it be livestock, poultry or equine. In home setting categories, an area we can differentiate in retail today. Here, you can see just our new brooder tower, solidifying TSC as the destination for poultry. Tractor Supply customers love their animals. And in our pet department, we've also increased space, allowing more holding power as well as allocating additional footage for categories like pet food and pet accessories, while improving the sight lines and shopping experience. This is such an important category for us and we continue to see opportunity to gain share. TSC is also a great place to have an outing with your dog and we've introduced new services for customers such as our pet wash. This new feature has been really well received by shoppers. We also plan to incorporate pilot wellness centers in select stores in partnership with our mobile clinic provider.  Gardening and landscape are significant destination categories for Tractor Supply, but we think we are only scratching the surface. As we mentioned earlier, we recognize we have an opportunity to really leverage these categories to grow with our existing customers while attracting and retaining new shoppers. For our seasonal department, we actually shifted it to the other side of the store to align the adjacency with our side lot so we could cohesively bring the inside department and the garden center to life.  Now let's move to the side lot area where you can see a remarkable change in the utilization of space, with one of the biggest transformational things we did was the creation of our garden center. Some of our new category highlights in the garden center include outdoor living and grilling, best-selling annuals, perennials, shrubs and trees, with a primary focus on fruit and garden which are very meaningful to the Out Here customer. We also believe this somewhat softens the store to appeal to a more female shopper base as well, which could drive sales in other categories like apparel, decor and pet.  We've added color in other live goods, really focusing in on items and products that we know our customers want as we want to be the destination for all-things-garden-related for our customers.  Beyond the garden center, our drive-through pickup lane allows for contactless customer service and convenience. Customers picking up buy online, pick up at stores orders stop at the first bay. And at our second bay, we have our new drive-through barn that allows our team members to load heavy animal feed, fencing and other core categories directly into their vehicles, convenience that we know our customers want. This entire Side Lot Transformation was completed without losing any products out of our original side lot. We just improved the merchandising through new fixtures that we think truly enhance the shopping experience and that will drive space productivity.  For my time in the store, I have seen firsthand the overwhelmingly positive response from our customers across all departments of the store with the improved shopping experience, assortment and creation of the garden center. We hope you enjoyed this virtual walk around the store, highlighting just a few of the changes that will bring our existing stores, their product assortments and shopping experiences to best-in-class standards by combining the art and the science of merchandising. We believe these initiatives will have a meaningful impact to driving space productivity and will be one of the catalysts for sustainable comp store sales as we roll out these initiatives out to the chain over time.  I hope you enjoyed seeing our Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation initiatives through the life of our Rome, Georgia store. We look forward to bringing the enhanced format to more stores across America in the coming months and years ahead.  And as we wrap up today, a few key takeaways I want to leave you with. First, we have significant initiatives to drive sustainable sales for space productivity. Second, we believe that our growth investments in technology, Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation will allow us to gain market share and drive comparable store sales over time. And third, our merchandising and shopping experience initiatives are designed to grow, attract and retain customers.  Over the past 82 years, Tractor Supply has worked hard to position our business as the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance products to farm, ranch and rural customers. We built a legacy on our ability to help our customers care for their home, their lands, their pets and their animals. But the story isn't over yet. With these initiatives, we are strategically poised to grow our business and continue to enhance our customers' in-store shopping experience while tailoring our assortment to serve their unique needs. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time today. Mary Pilkington : Thank you, Seth. Tractor Supply has become the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the U.S. by focusing on the continued improvement of our customers' experience inside our stores. We call it operating The Tractor Way and it's how TSC drives productivity and efficiencies to elevate customer service. Here to tell us more about operating The Tractor Way and its positive effect across all 1,900 stores is Executive Vice President and Chief Stores Officer, John Ordus. John Ordus : Thank you, Mary Winn. It's great to talk to you all today about operating The Tractor Way. Before we talk about Tractor Way, I'm going to talk to you about our opportunity. At Tractor Supply, we have a solid operating foundation in place across our more than 1,900 stores. At the same time, we believe there's an opportunity to increase labor productivity. Based on our industry benchmarking, we know we have room to grow to be best-in-class on customer-facing sales-driving initiatives. Our teams have made progress over the last couple of years with a nearly 400 basis point improvement in customer service by adding workforce planning, task management and the rollover of our Tractor Way program. There is still a lot more that we can do to help drive efficiency in our operating processes and structure to free up hours to focus on customer service.  We are going to continue to reinvest in labor efficiencies and the customer experience. We are also going to continue to invest in new stores with a target of 75 to 80 new stores a year, drive productivity of our existing stores, take task work out of our stores and use technology-like initiatives like in-store communication, labor management, interfaces that give team members actionable information and capabilities and optimizing payroll by store.  The foundation of our strategic pillar, operate The Tractor Way, is The Tractor Way program we first launched chain-wide in 2019 as a way to make our freight and recovery process more efficient and reinvest the hours from operational efficiency into customer experience. Our initial program focused on our most time-intensive and high-customer impact processes, things like freight, recovery, daily maintenance, zero-outs and feed the floor. The focus was to drive value to the customers through more time for customer service, improved in-stock position and a recovered store that is easy to shop.  To provide more time for customer service, we drove efficiency in our key processes through designated roles like our assistant manager is now our freight team leader; smart process design that removed wasted steps; we invested in new cards, totes and scanners; and clear finish-line goals and schedules to motivate the team to make sure all stores are following the same process. We have excellent training support and a process built to support all stores and account for normal retail disruptions.  With this foundation, we have built some strong muscle in the world of productivity. I have never seen the field take on a program and execute like they did with The Tractor Way program. They love this program. The outcome of the process improvements allowed us to roll out the GURA sales leader in all stores. I'll talk more about this position in just a minute, but the key point is the position works. Our racetrack in stores engage with every customer. We have the best team members. We hire our customers and they love to talk about our products because they live that Out Here lifestyle.  We're a relationship retailer. Our customers have responded to the changes we made with The Tractor Way initiatives. We measure customer experience in our stores by GURA scores. GURA stands for greet, uncover, recommend and ask. And we also measure overall satisfaction. Our customers score our stores at Tractor Supply. That is who we want to hear from, that is who should score our stores. Even though we are already top box on both metrics, as you can see, we improved our already high scores. This chart highlights the strong improvements in availability of assistance and product availability. Adding the GURA sales leader in every store helps us engage with the customer faster. And as you can see, availability of assistance has increased 250 basis points.  After seeing the success with freight recovery, the most labor-intensive activity in our stores, we are now applying The Tractor Way to other areas of the store. Our field activity support teams are another example of applying The Tractor Way philosophy to remove task work from the stores and make that work more efficient for the teams that are doing it. By removing this highly variable work from those stores and giving it to a specialized team, we have again provided more time for our store team members to execute GURA. The purpose of FAST is to support the stores in creating the legendary in-store experience for our customers through best-in-class merchandising execution. FAST does this through consistency, speed to market, quality, accountability and flexibility. We launched FAST company-wide on September 2020. Let's take a look at our FAST team member setting an end-cap. As you can see, the FAST team member uses the tools we have, provided to be efficient and safe footsteps. When they are finished, the planogram is completely set and the store manager signs off.  Feedback from the stores has been great so far. I was in the store just right after the leather boots set and the FAST team did it faster and more accurately than in years past. The store teams are giving very positive feedback. In the first 4 weeks of the program, we have seen a significant year-over-year improvement in planograms. This leads to higher sales and much better shopping experience. We now are executing planograms at over 95% compliance, which is 40-plus percent better than last year. This is an industry-leading best practice that we will continue to leverage.  With the launch of FAST in 2020, we have built cross-functional alignment and support. We are already seeing the benefits of the FAST team and how we are going to be able to complete more resets on time with a higher level of execution, bringing benefit to our customers, our store teams and our vendors. We believe FAST can do even more to benefit our customers and our stores as the program matures and the teams gain even more speed and efficiency. Some examples are assembly, top stock, recovery, promotions, physical inventories and a whole lot more. And we'll continue to evolve the FAST capabilities over time.  Now let's talk about GURA. The Tractor Way is driven by the commitment to provide a legendary customer experience for our customers. We do that by executing GURA. GURA is the foundation of our customer experience.  Greet. Team member welcomes the customer upon entering the store, shares their name and ask an open-ended question about their trip. Uncover. A team member uncovers the customers' needs by building a relationship and asking further questions. Recommend. Team member leverages understanding of customer needs and resources available to them. They use things like the stockyard to make sure that we can provide the proper recommendations and ensure that the customer has everything they need to complete their entire project. This is where our team members really stand out as they live that Out Here lifestyle and have deep experience. And ask. Team members have several techniques for closing out the sale.  To see the most value from The Tractor Way, we created the GURA sales leader. The GURA sales leader is the air traffic controller of the store. They are responsible for ensuring every customer experience is GURA and for motivating and coaching team members throughout the store. We cover all open hours with a GURA sales leader in every store. Each GURA sales leader has a shift goal and they're responsible for communicating that goal to the entire team. This allows the day to be broken down into smaller segments and creates competition to beat the goal each shift. That GURA sales leader is connected to the entire team with heads-up and hands-free communication through our in-store communication device. This improves the GURA sales leader's ability to increase the speed of service and be way more efficient. Every team member in the store is equipped with a voice-activated, hands-free device that has effectively served as an intelligent assistant to allow for instant communication and information for the customers' needs. We are continuing to provide enhanced training to equip our GURA sales leaders and our team members to be able to provide an even better customer experience.  In our stores, we live out the mission of Tractor Supply every single day. Our mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices. Our mission doesn't say good service or okay service, it says legendary service. Our teams talking about legendary service and being that dependable supplier all the time.  To live up to legendary and to have fun, we developed the Hi Five program. This program supports GURA by nurturing our selling culture and providing opportunities for store team members to have some friendly competition in their stores and with their stores in their district. Hi Five is all about selling. 5 selling priorities give the team members some more specifics about add-on selling, which is part of recommend and ask in GURA. As you can see, our team is really excited about this program. We focus on categories like pet, bird, equine, chicken and seasonally relevant categories. Team members are trained on what makes great add-on sales for them in these categories. This ensures our customers have everything they need and helps the store reach their sales bonus. Hi Five also focuses on additional programs we have to offer the customer, like our Power Plus Protection Plan, Neighbor's Club and our private label credit card. All of these areas are at all-time highs in our company.  We have seen strong success from the Hi Five program and the store team members. This program has been in place for about 2.5 years now. It's always energizing when our teams share their customer success stories when I'm out and in the field visiting stores. I also get hundreds of success stories a month on team members taking care of customers. We hear it from our customers and our team members. This year so far, our great team members have had 743,000 positive comments or 72% of all comments from our customers. 118,000 of these positive comments mentioned a team member by name. This is GURA. That is legendary service. To wrap up, let me on with some key points. At Tractor Supply, we have an incredible strong foundation through our stores and our committed passionate team members who are proud to serve our customers. Our customer service is key to retaining the new customers that shop with Tractor Supply over the past 7 months. We believe that we have significant opportunity to reinvest efficiencies from our labor productivity into our customer experience to drive more sales. Our field activity support teams will allow us to enhance the quality of the in-store experience for our customers, all while driving more productivity. Through new technology and new applications, we can close the gap in customer-facing hours in store with best-in-class retailers to drive more sales.  A differentiator for Tractor Supply is our culture. It is clear competitive advantage to making Tractor Supply a great place to work and a great place to shop. I've been with Tractor Supply for around 22 years now and I'm incredibly passionate about our team members and our customers. As a relationship retailer, the magic happens when our team member engages with our customer. I love seeing our stores and I think you will, too. Thank you all for your time. Mary Pilkington : Thank you, John. Now is a good time to press pause and give you a very quick break. So when we return, Chief Technology Officer Rob Mills will share details on digital's expanding role in our Life Out Here strategy and CFO Kurt Barton will conclude our presentations with our strategy for delivering healthy shareholder return. We'll see you back here in a few minutes. Mary Pilkington : Welcome back. We're glad you're with us. Now before we dive back in, a quick reminder. In just a little over half an hour, we'll have a Q&A session with members of our management team, so please stay with us. At the top of today's presentation, our CEO, Hal Lawton, explained our Life Out Here strategy and its commitment to our customers to deliver the products they need, however, whenever and wherever they need them. Joining us now to share how investment in our digital platforms is allowing us to honor that commitment both now and in the future, here's Rob Mills, our EVP, Chief Technology, Digital Commerce and Strategy Officer. Robert Mills : Hello, everyone. It's great to be here with you virtually today. A few years ago, we introduced our ONETractor strategy. This strategy drove significant progress for Tractor Supply, making great strides in providing a seamless customer experience. Further, the capabilities we introduced as a part of ONETractor have helped to fuel our growth during recent shifts in consumer behaviors and habits, many of which that are here to stay.  The past 6 months have accelerated digital adoption across the retail sector. Our digital strategies are a key part of our plans to sustain and grow not only with our new and reengaged customers but with our core customers who are more digitally engaged than ever. Our digital growth has been driven by introducing new capabilities and improving the shopping journey. Even with this significant growth, we still have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us compared to other hardline and specialty retailers. Just a few years ago, e-commerce represented less than 1% of our business. And today, we are nearing 6% with continued plans to grow that share. Our online conversion rates continued to improve with double-digit growth in recent years as we evolve that shopping experience through new capabilities and have provided an intuitive checkout with efficient and fast fulfillment options. An example of this is how we introduced curbside pickup earlier this year. Delivering legendary customer experience is our top priority, making certain that the customer experience has always ranked above our peer group, leveraging industry benchmarks such as 4C. While these capabilities we have built are serving us well today, we will continue to invest in furthering those capabilities in 3 ways : by implementing a best-in-class platform and technology, hiring and developing the best technology team and growing our digital expertise across the company.  Our goal is to deliver a world-class customer experience, supported by efficient business processes and a strong fulfillment strategy. We are transforming our business to be more digitally focused and we are connecting the customer experience together across ways they want to shop and interact with us. Our customers have told us they want to shop digitally. The success of Buy Online Pickup in Store and Ship to Store programs have illustrated this, representing over 80% of our online sales. We saw rapid adoption of our customer mobile app this summer with customers leveraging the shopping experience, curbside pickup, notifications and managing their Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And our efforts to improve the online experience and drive traffic to the website are resulting in new customer acquisition.  The goals of our advancing ONETractor capabilities pillar are fairly simple. There are 3 primary areas to focus to accomplish this : delivering legendary customer experiences anytime, anywhere, anyway; digitizing our business processes; and furthering our omnichannel capabilities. Let's talk about each of these.  We will continue to transform the customer experience with a focus on personalized content, messaging and products that meet their needs in a fast and convenient way. We are improving the online experience by optimizing search capabilities and navigation to ensure that our customers can easily find the products and services they require.  With our newly released customer mobile app, we are able to further personalize those customer experiences and provide features that make the shopping experience simple and convenient, drawing insights by leveraging information that our customers share with us through our Neighbor's club program, profiles and purchase histories. This allows us to provide product recommendations for their specific animals, pets and property. For example, a customer who purchased baby chicks has specific needs throughout the life cycle of that bird. Using machine learning to identify shopping trends and needs, we can anticipate and serve our content specific to each stage of the chicken's life, from caring for chicks during warm and cold periods to protecting the flock from predators with the right chicken coop. Once these trends and data points are identified, we can leverage artificial intelligence to recommend specific products and content, fulfillment options that fit the customers' lifestyle and even direct customers to on-demand expert advice.  We are taking steps to further the integration of the online and in-store experiences, enabling our team members with information and digitizing the store. Digitizing the layout of our fleet of stores will empower us to drive improvements in sales per square foot, enable team member efficiencies and provide new capabilities such as way-finding to our customers. Imagine a customer who dwells in front of a riding lawn mower outside the store for several minutes. We can message them with a compelling financing offer or offer assistance through our mobile app, allowing them to notify an in-store team member that they have a question. This is just one example of how we are digitizing the in-store experience.  To continue improving the seamless experience, we are investing in intelligent assistant devices John mentioned earlier for all of our store team members, allowing instant communication with one another and being informed of those customers' needs. By integrating this technology with customer-facing capabilities, such as our mobile app, we can reduce wait times and improve the execution, directly impacting the customers' experience, customer satisfaction and ultimately driving sales. You've heard us talk about our expert product knowledge, being the authority for the Out Here lifestyle. Leveraging this deep knowledge, we are able to curate a localized product assortment that meets our customers' needs, positioning our in-store assortment to meet daily needs then augmenting it with an extended assortment on our website and mobile app that remain localized and personalized. In addition to having the right product mix, it's important that we provide rich content for our customers and our team members, digitizing that deep knowledge I mentioned earlier. We can then help them how-to information when they run into problems on their property, provide them data to make decisions about what product is best for their animal needs and make sure they know what is needed to complete each project in advance.  Earlier, I referenced a customer purchasing baby chicks and understanding the life cycle of the birds. By knowing this information, we can offer them content and advice at relevant times, helping them understand when they need to change feeds, purchase supplements and other wellness needs that will improve and maintain the chick's health.  Personalizing the message isn't enough, though. We also have to offer that knowledge and ways our customers prefer, such as showing relevant content on their home page, providing fast answers to common questions and problems powered by automation and offering live ask-the-expert capabilities to share deep knowledge and understanding.  How customers receive their products is a key satisfaction driver in retail today, whether in-store, picked up or delivered. How we execute, the speed at which we do so and the costs are important factors. Over the years, many retailers have accepted inefficient cost structure to accomplish this. We have the opportunity to get it in front of this, leveraging a variety of options to offer the value propositions our customers want without sacrificing profitability. We are working to align our fulfillment options to our SKUs and categories to drive this efficiency and profitability. And combining this, the leveraging of our store locations and inventory investments, we will be able to ensure we provide multiple options that meet the customers' expectations.  With our wide assortment of products, fulfillment is not a one-size-fits-all. By providing options to ship from our stores and DCs, offering Buy Online Pickup in Store and curbside and delivering products from our stores can help us align the right fulfillment method to each specific product. A critical component of this strategy is how we leverage our order management systems to optimize how we route orders across our different fulfillment channels, allowing us to deliver quickly and cost effectively to the customer.  Our goal is to provide 1-day delivery to 99% of our customers while improving our profitability. By investing in systems and artificial intelligence that will identify the right methods and optimize the routing of the product, we can ensure we are choosing the best options, actively leveraging our network of stores for that final mile.  My team is energized to help capture the growth opportunities ahead of us. We have much more in the works and I look forward to sharing with you over time. Today's framework shared with you is how we intend to further evolve our seamless customer experience, advancing our ONETractor capabilities.  In summary, I'm going to leave you with 4 key takeaways that will allow us to capture significant growth opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to improve the customer shopping experience across all channels, striving to be that best-in-class omnichannel retailer. We will have an extreme focus on digitizing our business processes by leveraging data and analytics and we will provide rich personalized content and digital interactions. Lastly, we will improve sales and profitability by providing efficient, robust fulfillment options to fit any need.  At Tractor Supply, we're passionate about our digital vision and I'm thrilled to be a part of this organization. Thanks for joining us today and don't forget to enjoy some holiday shopping on tractorsupply.com. Mary Pilkington : There are certainly some exciting developments coming from our digital team. In addition to meeting the needs of our customers, one of the pillars of our Life Out Here strategy is to generate healthy investor returns. Here's our CFO, Kurt Barton, to take a deeper dive into that subject. Kurt Barton : Good morning again, everyone. In these incredibly uncertain and complex times, the Tractor Supply team has found a way to truly thrive. It is a testament to each and every one of our team members and our resilient business model that we have found a way to really be there for our customers, serving them with care and doing our best to have the right products and services for them at the right price and available anytime, anywhere, any way they choose to shop.  Our Life Out Here strategy is grounded in our focus on delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return. We are humbled by our strong operating financial performance year-to-date, which is a true testament to our differentiated and durable core business. And as you have heard from Hal and others, given our extremely strong financial performance and resources, we plan to make significant investments to enable us to continue to gain market share. We are confident that our planned growth and margin-driving initiatives such as Fusion, Side Lot and FAST, will strengthen our foundation and enable us to emerge even stronger on the other side of the pandemic. My goal is to provide deeper insights on how our disciplined capital stewardship supports our business strategy and can deliver strong and sustainable TSR.  I will first highlight our strong and durable financial performance and the free cash flows that enables us to make the critically important organic investments that we have been discussing with you. These investments will allow us to build on our strong growth platform and strengthen our advantage. I will also highlight how we plan to return excess cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And then finally, I will reinforce our commitment to a healthy and resilient balance sheet with investment-grade credit rating.  We believe the shift in consumer interest and behavior caused by the COVID pandemic has created a sustainable tailwind for Tractor Supply, as shown by the red line on this graph. How long that lasts, we don't know. Nobody has a crystal ball to really indicate when normalcy will return. While the exact dates are uncertain, we view the revenue performance in 3 phases : first, the COVID pandemic phase and then a 1-year post-COVID period and then an extended normalized post-COVID period being beyond 1 year.  The one year post-COVID period represents the period of time for us to comp the current exceptional and unprecedented performance. The 12 months following the end of the pandemic will come with some level of uncertainty in our comp performance, as it will for most retailers. We do expect our comp revenue to be on a different and stronger trajectory post COVID as a result of our strategic investments, as this slide illustrates. As you see in the pre-COVID time period, we had a healthy trajectory line that was 2.5% to 3% comps. Soon after COVID began significantly impacting us here in the U.S., we saw a major step-up change in our comps. With the step-up in growth we have seen during this pandemic and given the important organic investments and broader macro trends that are favorable to Life Out Here, our goal is to sustain the stepped-up sales growth and to achieve an even stronger growth trend line than pre pandemic the year after we see the environment return to normalcy. And that's shown by the steeper slope in the blue dash line relative to the pre-COVID trajectory.  When we reach the normalized post-COVID period, the main improvement we expect to see is on comp sales, where our key strategic initiatives should be meaningfully accretive to our financial profile. Specifically, we're targeting a sales comp in the 4% to 5% range and total net sales in the 6% to 7% range. We expect to remain consistent in our number of store openings in comparison to pre-COVID period. With the step-up in the base revenue, the new stores contribute less to the overall sales growth than the pre-COVID period. And to remind you, we still have headroom to open another 600 locations.  Looking to margin. We believe that through our greater scale and improvements in efficiencies, we have the ability to deliver operating margin in the mid 9% range. This would lead us to attractive ongoing 8% to 10% EPS growth post normalization, all of that on a much higher base. We will also focus on strong free cash flow generation and maintaining a healthy balance sheet, all while not losing sight of our goal of delivering strong and sustainable TSR.  Our key initiatives are laser-like focus on improving store productivity leading to stronger comp growth. As you've heard today, we're very excited about side lot and the significant amount of outside selling space that we will use more productively, bringing in an entirely new range of seasonal live goods and adding speed and convenience our customers want with drive-through feed and drive-through curbside pickup. With Project Fusion, we are remodeling stores to bring an even more productive and relevant offering to each community. The multiyear rollout of Side Lot and Project Fusion initiatives are expected to provide ongoing benefits in the years ahead as we move quickly and thoughtfully store-by-store with the goal of an extended period of 4% to 5% comp store revenue growth.  As you heard from Rob, continuing our ONETractor initiatives will help to increase our omnichannel conversion. Neighbor's Club program enhancements are well underway and the FAST program is rolled out, both expected to drive benefits starting in 2021.  One of our great strengths is strong free cash flow generation. We currently expect to generate approximately $3.5 billion in free cash flow over the next 5 years. We've always exercised strong financial discipline focusing on accretive investments to drive the top line, margin dollars and free cash flow. We are taking advantage of our current strong cash flow generation to make further investments for growth and investments to support our team. Our increased focus on technology and training tools to support and strengthen our team members will continue to drive legendary customer service as defined by our customers today. These investments, when coupled with our ongoing profit improvement initiatives and our working capital improvements, are expected to generate higher operating cash flow going forward versus pre COVID. Our strong balance sheet and our investment-grade capital structure is a strength we can leverage further. As you may have seen, yesterday, both Moody's and S&P announced investment-grade ratings for Tractor Supply. This provides us additional levers in our capital structure to support growth investments. In addition, with this performance, our goal is to return to shareholders approximately $4 billion in total cash payouts through dividends and share repurchases through our strong free cash flow and excess cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will have the financial capacity to consider opportunistic tuck-in acquisitions. We will continue to practice strong financial discipline, always with the goal of delivering strong and sustainable TSR to our shareholders.  This chart puts some dollars to what we just talked about. As you see in this cash flow waterfall, our operating cash flow target over this period is approximately $6 billion. Our capital expenditures are expected to be a total of $2.5 billion over the next five years, reflecting approximately $1 billion in incremental growth CapEx to strengthen our advantage. This increased level of spend is critical to continuing to gain market share. And because of our strong operating model, we expect to be in a position to return, through the combination of dividends and share repurchases, approximately $4 billion to shareholders during this time.  As I indicated earlier, our priority will be investing for growth, doubling our organic investments to include significant growth spend. We anticipate growing our dividend per share, returning to a 30% dividend payout on a higher and faster-growing EPS base. We plan to continue to be active in share repurchases to offset dilution effect of equity grants and to opportunistically repurchase with excess cash. We expect dividends and share repurchases to contribute 3% to 4% to our TSR delivery. While not a key priority, we are open to tuck-in acquisitions at the right price.  Historically, our leverage ratio has been approximately 2x. During COVID, we were able to maintain that ratio and we expect our leverage to remain at that level with the flexibility to use our strong balance sheet for incremental investment opportunities. And we're targeting to maintaining a leverage ratio below 2.5x. And we are positioned well to take advantage of our investment-grade rating and may look to refinance a portion of our debt when there is an attractive opportunity. There has never been a more exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are incredibly proud of our heritage. There have been many key chapters in our amazing history. This is the beginning of a new chapter. Our solid foundation combined with shifts in the macro environment and our Life Out Here strategy provide us with significant growth opportunities. We are purposely aligning our business strategy and our financial strategy with the goal of delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return.  With that, I will turn it back over to Mary Winn. Mary Pilkington : Thank you, Kurt. Well, we've certainly shared a lot of information with you today and our hope is that you've gained some insight into our Life Out Here strategy.  Now for a few takeaways and closing remarks, here's Hal Lawton. Harry Lawton : We are all about the Out Here lifestyle. Our Life Out Here strategy is focused on being an integral part of our customers' lives. And as we close out our prepared remarks, I hope you take away that we're a market leader with strong omnichannel capabilities, that our culture is a competitive advantage, that we have a resilient business model with compelling growth opportunities and we have the resources and are committed to allocating them to effectively execute our Life Out Here strategy.  Thank you for joining us today and I look forward to answering your questions in just a bit. Mary Pilkington : Our executive panel Q&A session is right around the corner. But first, we'll step away for a quick break. We'll be right back. A - Mary Pilkington : Welcome back to the Q&A session of Tractor Supply's enhanced earning event. We've assembled today's presenters and they are ready to take your questions. A couple of housekeeping notes first. [Operator Instructions]. For anyone just tuning in, a quick introduction of our team : President and CEO, Hal Lawton; CFO, Treasurer, Kurt Barton; Chief Merchandising Officer, Seth Estep; Chief Stores Officer, John Ordus; Chief Technology Officer, Rob Mills. We have a line of folks standing by, so let's take our first question. First up is Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem : Thanks for hosting a great event today, really well done. So first question for me on the 4% to 5% long-term comp outlook. This compares to about 3%-plus previously. And I'm hoping you could bridge the gap for us, talk about how you're quantifying the impact of the initiatives you've discussed today. And then what impact would you assign towards changes that are more structural, like the urbanization, rising pet ownership and other external factors due to COVID? Harry Lawton : Yes, great. I'll take that. Zach, it's great to see you this morning and thanks for joining us for our enhanced earnings day. The way I think what Kurt in his presentation tried to kind of outline is we anticipate that COVID will -- we'll be dealing with COVID. It will be part of the U.S. economy and consumer mentality for the better part of next year. And then as we start to comp on top of that, that will create some period of uncertainty, really depending with a lot of parameters impacting that. It could be the pace of the adoption of a vaccine, the effectiveness of a vaccine and then how user behavior changes afterwards.  What I would say is, from our view, the longer that kind of COVID -- the COVID pandemic is here, we think the longer, the more structural a lot of the trends are that we're seeing. If you think about as an example, year-to-date, we've sold 11 million birds. Pet adoption and ownership at an all-time high. Those are annuity streams that are going to continue on. Work from home and kind of this investment in your home, because you're there more frequently, that's going to continue even post COVID.  So as we think about kind of the 12 months post COVID, there's some period of kind of settling out but we're becoming more confident in that. And then once we get to the end of that, then we think we get back to a more normal routine run rate. And if our previous long-term guidance had been about 3%, what we're starting to do is add on top of that 3% the initiatives that we're announcing today. That would be the initiatives of maintaining our new customer base that we've seen and starting to -- continuing to have business from that group that's sustaining our levels that we're already operating at but also growing on top of it. But it also comes down to our existing store base, the productivity we're going to get from the existing store base both inside the store as well as outside of the store and then the continued growth from our digital business. As you know, we've got, I think, over 30 quarters of double-digit growth. And the last two quarters have been over 100% comps. And so we see that continuing to play out. So we feel very good about the increase of our comp guidance from previously 3% to 4% to 5% based on kind of that waterfall of initiatives. Zachary Fadem : Got it. I appreciate that. And then quickly moving to the long-term EBIT margin of 9% to 9.5%. This looks to be a bit of a step-down from about 10% this year. Obviously, given the tough compares next year and the step-up in investments, I'm curious if the 9% to 9.5% margin is the right way to frame expectations during this fiscal '21, '22 transition period or after the near-term investments or both. Kurt Barton : Yes. Zach, this is Kurt. I'll take that question. In regards to our long-term target, we've been very specific in saying that this COVID pandemic, there's uncertainty as to how long it lasts and when does this 12-month of a cycling begin. And some of that may fall into 2021 and so there may be some noise on exactly the level of performance on a top line that would certainly impact it. What you've heard from us on our initiatives are that we believe that this business has got strong sustainable growth. We can begin to not only achieve top level sales growth but sustain this level.  And then for 2021, the operating margin that we gave could have a little bit of variability in it. But a 9.0% to 9.5% in our long-term target is a really good sweet spot for us. We feel like the opportunity and our primary focus of gaining market share and being able to have a 9% to 9.5% operating margin range gives the most optimal overall earnings per share and value to our shareholders. And so our focus is on the long term in both top line revenue and that operating margin. Mary Pilkington : Okay. We have our next question and that question is from Peter Benedict at Baird. Peter Benedict : Thanks for doing this event. Extremely well done, very helpful particularly with everything going on. So thanks for doing this. My first question, I guess, Hal, you threw out the TAM, $110 billion TAM in your remarks. Wondering if you could unpack that a bit, where you see kind of the most potential for gains, the most opportunity. And how do the services play into that? I know in the past, you've talked a little bit about tool rental, things like that, but I'm just curious if that's kind of -- if that's part of the current thinking here as you're moving through the next few years. That's my first question. Harry Lawton : Yes. Good morning, Peter and thanks for joining us on our enhanced earnings day here and I appreciate the comments. Over the last 6 to 9 months, as we've been both dealing with COVID, responding to numerous natural disasters and also dealing with the -- kind of operating at these elevated volume levels, we've also been preparing and kind of laying the foundation for the future of the company. And part of that really started with, what is our total addressable market? And that allows us to understand where share gains can be had and where our opportunities are.  And so we spent a good bit of time really digging in each of our categories, understanding where we participate in each of those categories, what the size of those markets are and then really also thinking about the markets that we address. So really, it's really a rural-suburban kind of cut of the categories that we participate in.  And after doing that work, we came to $110 billion market, a large market. One with a significant amount of opportunity, one where we have nice share at kind of 10-ish percent but one that presents a lot of opportunity for growth in front of us. And as we've talked about, we think there's a lot of opportunity to do more with our existing assets. We think there's opportunities to continue to build stores to our $2,500 target. And there's also opportunity to continue to grow our digital footprint that's dominantly with and through our stores. As it relates to the categories, I'm going to toss it to Seth and he could talk a little bit about some of the categories that we're making big investments in and where we think there's some growth. Seth Estep : Yes. Thanks, Hal. Thanks, Peter. I like the cap, by the way. Yes, when we think about the total addressable market, that's one data point that the merchants have utilized in coming up with where we're really going to focus and, as Hal mentioned, where we're going to make some of these big investments.  To put it in perspective, we showed earlier today the investments in the garden center. And you think about the size of the traditional lawn and garden category that's out there, excluding OPE where we've been strong in for a long time and that's over a $20 billion industry that's out there. So for every share point that we can go out and get, where today we're low single digits when we think about where we are there, that's $200 million of opportunity in revenue growth. So as we think about these things and the data points -- we've looked at that in tools and DIY, obviously, where we are with pet and animal -- we've gone around the store. And as we think about Fusion and how we have laid out the category expansions, where we've looked at those footprints, we've really partnered with our vendor base, use all the different analytics points to really figure out where we're going to go invest in and whether that be in lawn and garden, again, whether it be pet and animal, whether it be in home setting categories, going after market share in those DIY areas and then utilizing our drive aisle to really go after that backyard, that activity and that's what that drives aisles are really for today, right? Take advantage of the current trends that's out there to build a basket. So hopefully, that helps a little bit in kind of how we're looking at the TAM and how we're building our category strategies accordingly. Peter Benedict : That sure does. And Seth, I guess, sticking with the garden center, just curious how you guys are approaching that. Are you going to own the live goods? Are you going to go consignment model? Just curious on kind of the margin and return profile, just how you're going to attack that business. Seth Estep : Peter, yes, it's a variation. So as we're rolling this out, I mean, we're in the initial phases of this. We partnered with some outside resources as well that are very much experts in this area. Again, I think we mentioned earlier, we've identified growers for over 75% of our current store base that we know that we have an opportunity to go out there and build these garden centers. So obviously, live goods are one component. It varies by different product segment of how -- whether we'll be owning it or whether it will be kind of scan-based type product. But then also, the other big thing in the garden center as well, it's really going to open up other categories like grilling, outdoor decor, some of those other things that can be very margin accretive as well as we build not just the live goods themselves. But that's really kind of the footstep driver to then build the basket. Mary Pilkington : Okay. We'll go on to our next question and our next question comes from Steve Forbes at Guggenheim. Steven Forbes : And again, really great to see the visual representation here. So thank you for all the effort. I wanted to start with a multipart question as it pertains to the side lots. So maybe for Hal or Seth, if you could speak to the cadence behind the initiative. Is the goal to have all 150, 200 stores done by spring, seasonal?  And should we expect the program to be completed by -- within that five year time frame that you laid out by 2025? Is that where we should expect all 60% to 75% of stores to be done? Harry Lawton : Yes, Steven and thanks for joining us on the enhanced earnings day today. And as it relates to the side lot, again, we're very bullish on the opportunity, significant opportunity to expand our sales per square foot and better utilize the side lot, the concrete pad outside of our stores. And I thought Seth really laid out that opportunity in his prepared remarks earlier very well.  As it relates to the cadence, as Seth said, we're looking somewhere in that kind of 50% to 65% range of stores for this year to accomplish. We're learning a lot as we go. We've got a real -- we've got great muscles built around building new stores and we're starting to adapt and tailor those muscles to being able to remodel stores. And doing that in the context of COVID, where you've got a lot of permitting that you've got to do and you've got town halls that -- have more virtual meetings now and those sorts of things. But we're working through that, building those muscles, building that flywheel and we feel very good about the progress we're making this year.  Next year as we move forward, we do anticipate getting at least half of those stores up and running in advance of the spring season. And then the remainder will happen through Q2 and Q3. And then as it relates to the 5-year outlook, once we get through midway into next year, we'll have a better sense of what our capacity and capabilities are for rollout in 2022 and beyond. We certainly have aspirations of addressing the -- Seth has said in his prepared remarks, I believe, he said 60% to 75% of our stores were applicable for side lot. And we have aspirations of addressing all those over a 5-year time frame. But what we do in years 2, 3 and 4 and 5 will vary a little bit based on just kind of our learnings as we roll it out next year in terms of our capacity and capability. Steven Forbes : Then just a follow up on pet ownership and the pet food trends. Probably for you, Hal. Would love to sort of hear your thoughts on the importance of this category as you think about ongoing share gains at the local level and would love to sort of speak to both existing and new customer trends right in this particular category, just with all the excitements around pet ownership post COVID here. Harry Lawton : Yes, absolutely. So first on pet, I want to be really clear. We are gaining share in pet food and gaining share in the pet category. And while that industry certainly, there's a rising tide there, we are gaining share in the context of that rising tide. As you mentioned, you've got both pet ownership at all-time highs combined with the humanization of the pet really reinforced because people are in their homes more around their pets. And so consequently, that's driving significant volume in the category.  It is a very strategically important category for us. It's a core part of what we call our CUE business. It drives footsteps, it drives transactions. And it's a cart-starter to build the basket for our customers in the store. And as we talked about our CUE business, I believe Kurt mentioned it, it was in the mid double-digit comps in Q2, up from high-kind-of-teens in Q2. So we did see a step-up in our CUE business and a part of that improvement was driven by our pet business. We saw a significant improvement in the trend in that business from Q2 to Q3. It is being driven by both our new customers, our reacquired customers and our existing customers. We're seeing increased transactions and larger baskets from our existing customers, but we're also seeing a strong number of new customers in the pet category shopping with us.  And their repeats are at much higher rates than we've seen in the past. So it's not a one-and-done or even a two-and-done and are qualitatively, as those customers indicate the vast majority in that they plan on incorporating Tractor Supply in their future shopping patterns.  Also online, our pet business is one of the big drivers of our online triple-digit comps. And that's both happening direct ship to people's homes but also the pickup in store. So we feel like we've got a strong pet business. It's important to us strategically and that we are gaining share both in our stores and online across all the customer base. Mary Pilkington : All right. Well, thank you very much. We'll move on to our next question which is from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good job this year. By the way, Mary Winn said my picture -- my mouth will move, so just watch out. And my first question is strategic and financial. The question is this, Hal, how much of the spending that -- in this plan is influenced by COVID and how well you've done? Were you thinking of these investments irrespective a year ago? Because it looks like you're spending a lot of additional capital. At the moment, the business is growing very fast, so it makes sense but there's a big step-up. And so it looks like the incremental return maybe can't be as good as where they are today. And yes, you're going to get faster revenue growth, but the EPS growth is -- it looks like it's going to slow. So if you can sort of take that all together. Harry Lawton : Yes, Simeon. So hit a few things. First off on how much of this was stimulated by COVID. I'd say we were working our strategy at the same time as we've been operating through the last 9 months. So the two were really much more in parallel than interrelated. What I would say is we do recognize that we're investing from a position of strength. We're committed to emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company and we are confident that we will do so.  As it relates to kind of the initiatives and the EPS, what I would say, 2 things : one, remind you we're at a much higher base now that we're operating at than we were 9 months ago. And certainly, 2 or 3 years ago, we did our long-term guidance previously.  And then the second thing I'd say is every single one of our initiatives and kind of the strategies that they kind of roll up into, we've done business cases for every single one of those. We know what the NPV and the NRRs are. We've modeled the TSR implications of those investments. And they are all kind of in the numbers that we've delivered to you today. And every single one of those investments, we're confident that it -- they generate healthy shareholder returns and generate value in the business. Simeon Gutman : And is the shape of the EPS growth and margins the same throughout the investment cycle? Or does it -- is it heavier upfront and then it accelerates later on? Harry Lawton : Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Kurt Barton : I'll take it. I'll take it. Simeon, this is Kurt. In regards to the time frame, first, I'll just point out and remind that slide I gave on the trajectory. There's a lot of uncertainty, there's the COVID pandemic, then there's that 1-year cycling. In regards to the investments, there's more consistency in regards to our expectation as to when to -- the cadence of that investment. The impact on the timing, we're not going to try to go ahead and at this point try to peg over time. But what we are confident is that we can achieve with these investments, as Hal said, investing right now in a position of strength. We're making those investments now. We've got the cash to be able to do that and these investments will begin to provide that level of return.  The exciting thing about this is this level of EPS growth, the operating margin that we believe we can sustain through that is during this period of time where we're committing to and making a stepped-up investment in the business. That's exciting for the near term. It's really exciting for the long-term and the overall total shareholder return. Mary Pilkington : All right. We'll move on to our next question, please. We'll go to Michael Lasser at UBS. Michael Lasser : Very nice job. So comparing your current guidance from an operating margin perspective of 9% to 9.5% to the 9% to 9.4% that you'd previously rolled out pre COVID, it would seem like based on updated comp expectation that the incremental profitability contribution from the 100 to 200 basis points that you're presumably going to get from the initiatives like Side Lot and Project Fusion are going to come in at a lower-than-average profitability that you'll offset with some incremental sales leverage on fixed costs. So why wouldn't the margin be higher given these incremental comp expectations? Kurt Barton : Yes, Michael, this is Kurt. Thank you for the question. Just build on the -- I'll build on the last explanation I gave earlier. The important factor here is that we're making these investments. It's a significant step-up. These investments are for the long term. These investments are the opportunity to achieve greater market share, sustain the stepped-up growth. And when you make this level of investment, in stores in particular, the Side Lot and Fusion are investments in our leasehold assets. And so these stores have 5-, 7-, 10-year leases. There's a burden in that time frame that we've baked into the financials. And so we think it's a very compelling algorithm to be able to produce the same and stepped-up level of operating margin during this time of investment to be able to continue to grow this business. As Hal mentioned, the last long-term targets that we set out back in 2018. If you think about the size of the business, say, $7.5 billion revenue business on a $4 EPS, we're certainly well beyond those numbers and be able to have the level of EPS growth while returning even greater shares -- greater cash to our shareholders, a commitment to a stronger level of dividend and a consistent share buyback. Overall, I'll just continue to emphasize, for the long term, our focus is total shareholder return. We think it's a very compelling -- much better compelling offer than a previous long-term targets. Harry Lawton : And Michael, the only thing I would kind of tactically call out is that the new sales are not dilutive. If you think about a 9%-ish to 9.4% on a 3% comp and then the investments we're making, particularly as it relates to capital and the depreciation that comes along with that and then our target that we shared today of 9% to 9.5%, they really are flowing through basically at the same operating margin rate that the base business, so to speak, was. So I just wanted to clarify that that's not the case when we modeled it out. Michael Lasser : Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on that. Can you provide more detail on the geography of how this is going to impact both the gross margin? Presumably, D&A is going to step up and so it will be -- that will flow through to higher SG&A. And as part of that, how should we think about what this adds to the operational complexity of running a Tractor Supply store either from incremental staffing or the shrink associated with having more expensive space and products that are more subject to obsolescence? Harry Lawton : Yes. Thanks, Michael. So what -- I'm going to ask John first to just talk about the operational models and the adjustments we've made in the Side Lot and Fusion stores that we've rolled out. Just to be clear, those are reflected in the numbers that we shared today. But John, maybe you can talk about that. And then, Kurt, you can come back to the broader geography questions. John Ordus : Sure. Michael, so what we've done is we put together a store productivity team a couple of years ago. And what that team has done is they continue to look at how we can make things more efficient inside the store. We're doing that, we're able to make sure that we have hours out in the side lot for all open hours of store. So we have people out there to do both the feed floor, the curbside, make sure the propane is taken care of and then also to make sure we have that greenhouse staff outside there. So as we continue to look at more efficiency inside the store, we can continue to make sure that we take hours, reinvest it in customer service and continue with those all-time customer service -- all-time high customer service scores we have. Kurt Barton : Yes. Thanks, John. And in regards to geography, the -- over a 3- to 5-year period of time, I'll stay rather directional and really hit 3 points. Starting with the gross margin, that is an area that we believe we have growth opportunity when you compare to the previous guide or the base year of 2019 for a number of the things that you heard today.  But just to hit a few key points on gross margin, we will continue to focus on our supply chain and our sourcing. There's opportunity to be able to take costs out of that part of the business as well as leveraging the scale that we've got and, from the fast program and from fusion and the productivity, does drive some performance in gross margin, so the opportunities in gross margin.  When it comes to the investments, to your point that you pointed out, the burden is principally in the -- from the depreciation from capital. So that's going to hit that SG&A area. And that is offset from very promising, strong, strategic initiatives on profit improvement. So we believe we can mostly offset the SG&A burden and we believe there's opportunity to achieve on the gross margin. All of that plays out to growing the operating margin modestly over this period of time. Mary Pilkington : All right. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I wanted to ask a couple of questions just on the side lot opportunity. Could you maybe give a little bit of color on what you think the possible sales per square foot to be on the side lot and then maybe what you're seeing currently and/or what the range is? And then I have one other question. Harry Lawton : We are not disclosing at this time kind of the individual pieces of our strategic initiatives. You can expect to hear more from us on that over time. But what I would say is the composition of our new customers and providing the -- kind of retaining them, also our omnichannel efforts, combined with side lot infusion, are reflected in our updated comp guidance.  What I would say is we're very pleased with the early results of our -- of the stores that we've implemented the side lot. Seth showed you the Rome, Georgia store today in a video and talked you through it. But we're very pleased with the early results and that's given us the conviction to do between 150 and 200 stores next year and allocate the capital that's required to do that and the incremental capital dollars that we shared with you today. And more to come, but we think there's a big opportunity in garden. As Seth mentioned, it's the #1 category that we are not a destination for, that our customers really participate in and so big opportunity there.  In feed, where we have the feed drive-through, we are the largest player in bagged dog feed in the country. And an opportunity for us always is to make that process more efficient for our customers. And I really do think the time that it requires to load up a customer's truck or trailer with feed as they begin their day is -- does drive the difference in people going left or right. So that will make a big difference in our ability to keep gaining share in a market that we're already the #1 player. And we're very excited, bullish and going to be investing into the side lot initiative. Karen Short : Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to just ask about the digitization of the store. So I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on how many stores are digitized and then how you think that would contribute to, I guess, splitting the assets? Because it seems like that's a little bit more of a newer nuance to the story that you haven't talked about that much in the past. Harry Lawton : Yes. Great. So I'm going to ask Seth to do that. And specifically, what you're going to hear from him is teeing up kind of the systems implementations we've done around macro and then the systems implementations we've done around micro that kind of come together through our line review process to deliver kind of more optimal outcomes. Seth Estep : Yes. Thanks, Hal. Yes, so we talked a little bit earlier about some of the systems that we are currently implementing, as Hal mentioned. It's both on a macro and a micro level. We are really starting on the micro level right now as we are going through all of our line review processes, whether that be through our store clustering on each individual category as well as then that being the assortment optimization that comes with that. And our tools that -- the Blue Yonder tool that we've been implementing is space aware, so it's integrated throughout all of our merchandising processes and systems. That really allow us to get smarter, better, more scientific and apply the merchandising art to that as well on each individual micro, call it, planogram space within the store.  The next step of that as well is within the software as well as through some projects, will be more the macro store clustering project that we'll be embarking on as well so that we can, again, get better on a local and a regional level and that we can start to tailor space accordingly to what those store clusters look like. Whether that be in opening up new stores or as we go on, on this Project Fusion and side lot journey, those store clusters will -- the macro store clusters will be a big part of that on, call it, what floor plan goes in there.  In addition to those two systems, we also have another system where it's the site-level CADs, where every store itself -- we have a significant number of stores that aren't, call it, a prototype, a stand-alone building that can have some nuances in there, could be a little bit larger than the 15,500, that we don't have great visibility to today on how much, call it, flex planogram space might be in a store. We've now got over 500 stores that we have site-level CADs that were out there today where we can now identify what those flex spaces are. Then as you just think about that and apply the space productivity metrics to it, over time, that can be a really good flywheel to drive comp, knowing that there's a big piece of the store base that has that flex space that now we can take and strategically drive planogram and space activity, too. Mary Pilkington : Okay. Thank you. Next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : My question is on new customer adoption, 10 million alone, I believe, in the second and third quarter. I'm curious on how that shopper is behaving both on trip frequency and basket size versus a more mature Tractor shopper and how that maturation curve could play out over the next couple of years. Harry Lawton : As it relates to new customers, to your point, as we remarked in our opening comments, 10 million new and reacquired customers between Q2 and Q3. And what I'd say is, first off, the pace of new customers really did not slow from Q2 to Q3 kind of the new customer counts that we were seeing on a weekly basis, with the exception of some modest seasonalization between Q2 and Q3, really continued at the same levels, meaning that we were really attracting new customers at the same pace in Q3. Some of that's driven by our continued advertising. But I think a lot of it's driven by just the lifestyle that people embrace in the Out Here Lifestyle and finding Tractor Supply a very relevant shopping destination for them in that lifestyle.  And we are laser-focused on retaining those customers. We're doing that through both our marketing efforts with robust CRM activities and digital marketing activities as well as bringing people into our Neighbor's Club, which we continue to increase our number of millions of customers that are members there, but also just in our stores and focusing on what's important to these new customers, delivering that legendary service and staying really focused on it.  As I mentioned earlier, the reshop rates with these customers are exceeding the historic rates we have of reshop rates with new customers not only on the second but also third time. And that gives us more confidence in the structural-oriented -- that there's more structural-ness versus transitory in those new customers. John, I know -- I'd let him speak a little bit in terms of having all-time customer SAP scores but also the focus on cleanliness and safety that we've had in our stores to really maybe bring some of that to life. John Ordus : Yes. So since COVID started, we've really spent a lot of time on cleanliness inside of our stores. We wanted -- we saw it coming. We wanted to make sure we saw some benchmarking out there as well. And what we've done is we've invested in that. We've invested in making sure that we're cleaning top to bottom throughout our stores all the time throughout Monday through Friday and then Saturday and Sunday, on the weekends, when our customers are in our stores. We want to make sure we had a clean environment for them. Bathrooms, everything throughout the store are cleaned. And we've seen that we're over-indexing now compared to other retailers as far as where we're at on cleaning. As far as customer experience goes, I talked a little bit about it earlier today, just customer experience, that high five, the GURA, we rolled out fast. It allowed us to take some of our people that we've hired that are more task-driven and moved them over into a task-driven environment.  Now the other team members that we have inside of our stores, what they do is they love to sell. They live that lifestyle. They love talking about that lifestyle. We hire for attitude. We hire farmers, welders, ranchers, horse owners. And then they're inside the store and they're doing what they really love, that GURA selling skills that are out there in our stores.  We're also investing in training of them. What that's driven us throughout this year is our GURA scores are up about 90 basis points over where they were last year. Over the last 4 years, they're up about 700 basis points. And then overall satisfaction scores continue to go up as well. Mary Pilkington : Okay. Thank you. Chuck Grom : That's great. So actually, some -- I guess my follow-up would be for Kurt. You spoke to the operating environment until the third quarter of next year may be at a minimum. So I guess if that's the case, I'm curious how you're thinking comps could shake out in 2021 particularly as you begin to cycle some of these big prints from the share. Kurt Barton : Yes. Well, I'll share a little bit of information. The -- we're not going to begin to give guidance or any indication on our 2021 plan, but we are beginning to and have been looking at and have multiple scenarios for 2021. We look at and watch closely all of the indications on how the COVID pandemic is playing out. And certainly, an important factor for us is when does this pandemic begin to bring a level of normalcy back to the consumer.  And vaccines and therapeutics are going to be key. And so I want to first say that the timing of when vaccines become available to the public, the therapeutic measurements improve, we believe, as most, that there's some level of normalcy that may return back to the consumer spending and the consumer behavior. And it's very hard to tell when. As we try to plan, we plan that, that may be mid- to late 2021. And so in that environment, we feel strong about the first half of the year, the first quarter, certainly. And I think we're planning on and investing and being able to have a strong performance in the second quarter.  And then as I indicated, as the chart that I showed indicated as well, that whenever that 1-year period of time to comp, there's some variability in it. We may have some positive growth still, they may be flattish and there's potential for even some downside in those numbers. And so we plan that the first half of the year, there's still a lot of indications for the strength and demand in our business is based on all the macro social distancing and emphasis at home. And then at some point in time, that will begin to fade as there's a level of normalcy that returns. And I think at this point that giving you guys a structure of how we think about it is about the best I can do at this point before we give any 2021 guidance. Harry Lawton : The only thing I'll add to Kurt's comments is we are staffing and buying to a Q2 that is dealing with the COVID pandemic. And we know we had elevated volume levels last year. We knew we were -- we were short on inventory in certain programs as we got into the middle of Q2 because we weren't anticipating obviously when we placed our import orders in the November, December time frame for 38% comps. We now know how consumers behave in the midst of the COVID pandemic and we're working both on our -- with our import partners as well as our domestic partners to build inventory levels to meet that demand this coming Q2. And we also are building staffing plans to meet that demand as well. Mary Pilkington : So great questions as always. [Operator Instructions]. So with that, our next question is from Oliver Wintermantel at Evercore ISI. Oliver Wintermantel : Yes. So Kurt, maybe it's for you. It's a question about free cash flow. You mentioned $3.5 billion over the next five years. So I just wanted to see if there's any -- from the cadence, is that more back-end loaded or have investments there an impact? And then on the share buybacks, you mentioned that you're going back into share buybacks. Is there any timing? And the size, is that also flat then over the next few years? Any color into buybacks. Kurt Barton : Okay. Yes. Thanks, Oliver. So there's two questions in there, free cash flow over time and then buybacks. I'll hit on the free cash flow. Certainly, as a reminder, the timing of the pandemic can play, bid into it, but in general, we've planned for a rather consistent pattern on the free cash flow over time. The investments maybe shift between years as to when a distribution center is loaded, but $450 million to $550 million investments into the business over time with a very continued strong level of operating cash flow from this business, we believe it will be relatively consistent throughout the period of time. And we think that's a really strong, compelling part of our business.  It then leaves us the ability to be able to return cash to our shareholders. And that a really purposeful, important part of the Life Out Here strategy for us is the capital allocation. And our first priority, as we've mentioned, is investing organically in the business with all the things that we've just been talking about. But it is exciting that in that period of time, we estimate or targeting returning $4 billion to our shareholders. The dividends are an important piece of our model. We're targeting to be able to get back to a 30% payout ratio, so there's some strong allocation to dividend. But on the buybacks, we've said in the beginning of the pandemic, we were temporarily pausing that and we did. And it was purposely a planned temporary pause. We do see that as we come out over the last couple of quarters, the business is strong, that share buybacks, as I indicated, are a plan in our capital allocation. So in the next couple of weeks, we'll be talking with our Board about our plans to reengage on the share repurchases and we'll have more information in the near term as to the timing of that. Mary Pilkington : Okay. We'll move on to our next question, which is from Peter Keith at Piper Sandler, please. Peter Keith : A great quarter. I know it's difficult to execute in this environment, but some really nice numbers today. You guys have a lot of interesting things going on. I was hoping at a high level, you could just talk about your competitive positioning and how these investments you feel might be structurally enhancing your competitive positioning relative to the competition. And maybe interested in how you might prioritize or rank those in order of importance. And then as a follow-on, just in the pet category, it's good to hear you're gaining share. But maybe specifically to pet, what are you doing there to enhance the competitive positioning? Harry Lawton : Yes. Peter, thanks for joining us today and appreciate your remarks about our quarter. I'd first start out with we had the opportunity of participating in an incredibly attractive market, $110 billion in size, fragmented, very favorable profitability structure. It's demand-driven, needs-based. And we had the benefit of being a scaled player in that with significant opportunity still ahead of us. As we think about a competitive positioning, we think about it a little bit less about the competitive positioning and more about the customer. And the whole focus is to stay ahead of where the customers' expectations are. And that the entire focus of Life Out Here strategy is to address that lifestyle need, that Out Here Lifestyle need and make sure that our offerings, our capabilities are best-in-class out there and surpassing what the customers' expectations are. And we firmly believe that if we do that, we will gain share in a very attractive market. And we are confident right now across all the categories that we compete in, no matter what the categories in our stores, that we are gaining substantive share.  Specifically as it relates to pet, as I said earlier, we are gaining share in pet. We know that when we look at the overall kind of industry-level data and also when we look at our data and when we talk with our customers -- our manufacturers. And what I'll talk with -- and I'll let Seth talk a little bit about kind of marketing and merchandising activity that we have going on there. Seth Estep : Yes. So thanks, Hal. So yes, from the pet space, for example, obviously, we spend a tremendous amount of time analyzing the space, analyzing market trends. From a product assortment standpoint, the team has absolutely done a fantastic job responding to the dynamics of the industry over the course of last year.  Actually, in Q3, every single pet consumable category was touched and reset and really had the consumer obviously at the heart of all those resets, going from, they call it, a grain-free assortment north of 40% prior to the August reset, now sub-25% and really leaning into some of those science-based brands, introducing new brands like Victor, partnering with Miranda Lambert MuttNation and getting those type of exclusive partnerships out there that can really engage with our consumer base.  But we're also continuing to go after things, like you saw today, like pet wash. We're looking at ways to be that convenient solution and a value-oriented solution for mobile vet clinics, where we have that in over 1,500 stores today. We partnered and have over 20 full-blown wellness clinics now in pilot in some of our stores. And we're talking to some of our partners out there as well on how we can look to incorporate some of that in next year's project -- at some select Project Fusion layouts.  And then obviously, a lot of the investments that we're also making in the digital space are really, really going after this consumer, not only being there for their products but try to really build that relationship with them in the digital space and then obviously with John and his team in the stores. So... Mary Pilkington : Okay. Our next question is from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : So I had one question in two parts. First, can you talk about how much of the business that you would classify as truly repeating in nature? I guess some of animal adoption includes crates and beds and that will, per se, repeat next year. So how do you think about true short replacement cycle as a percentage of your mix? At the same time, buying a riding mower is in short cycle and can you give the other side of it, which is what is -- what portion of the mix would you create as sort of a multiyear replacement cycle business?  And the second part of the question is you mentioned expecting positive comps in the first half of next year given COVID sticks around and mentioning chasing demand in 2Q '20. Would that suggest that you could potentially lap 2Q with the positive comp? Harry Lawton : Yes. Again, thanks for joining us today. As Kurt mentioned in his remarks and also in last quarter's remarks, we see about 50% of our elevated comps being more structural and about half of it being a little bit more transitory. And there's a variety of kind of different ways that we look at it to kind of come to that conclusion, but we feel very good about that. And I'd say, if anything, we're becoming more comfortable on the structural side as the pandemic progresses.  To your point, say, on dogs, certainly, you might not buy that crate again. But if you bought a small bed, then you're going to upgrade to a larger bed. Or if you got a small ball for your pet, it's very much an annuity-type business.  And then on garden, while certainly we have very strong share in things like riders, there's a lot of opportunity, as Seth shared, for us to gain a broader share in the garden business, whether it's in soils and fertilizers, certainly live goods, outdoor power more broadly. And those are the sorts of categories that you can see us really emphasizing, grilling, you can see us leaning into those. So as we start to cycle some of the bigger-ticket purchases, we're looking for those other categories to really offset that and drive those kind of comp sales in those sorts of businesses.  As it relates to Q2, as I said, we're leaning in on it. We're buying for it. We're going to staff for it. And then we'll see how it evolves as we get into next year. There's a lot of uncertainties, as Kurt's laid out, not only the pandemic but how the economy is going to be, what the economic conditions are going to be, unemployment, stimulus, those sorts of things. So we'll -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but know that we are leaning into Q2. Mary Pilkington : Okay. We'll move on to our next question, which is Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Great results. Congratulations. So my question and I'll keep it to one just with respect to Mary Winn's request. It's shorter term in nature, so I apologize. We talked a lot about the potential for -- Kurt, you talked about in your presentation the potential for normalization after COVID. If you look at the results now, clearly, a historically strong comp in second quarter and that's -- I'm sorry, third quarter, I apologize, very strong comp in the second quarter. The guidance for Q4 does assume some kind of moderation. I'm assuming there's likely conservatism in that. But the question I have is, are you starting to see -- even with COVID still there, are you starting to see some indication that your consumer is beginning to normalize in their buying patterns? Is that a factor behind whatever is in the report? Kurt Barton : Do you want to take it? Harry Lawton : Yes, I'll take it. What I would say is our business has been remarkably consistent. And we've seen no trailing off of consumer behavior at all. And in fact, we're seeing right now simultaneous strength in even some extended spring goods and summer goods, say, like riders as well as strength in more seasonal goods like patio heaters, log splitters, chain saws and outerwear as people are starting to think about the winter and as the fall and winter season approaches. And they're really approaching it with the same mentality as they approached spring. And in fact, we're seeing a little bit more of even of some stock-up behavior, where I think those who were last in line, so to speak, in the spring and summer, they didn't -- they weren't able to get the patio furniture. They weren't able to get that pool put in. They weren't able to do some of the things that they wanted to do to their backyard. And they're not going to miss out on that here as they go into the fall and into the winter time.  So our comps month-by-month in Q3 were very consistent. Our comps across geographies, very consistent. Our comps across categories, very consistent. We're seeing that continue into Q4 here. And we're seeing the same level of behavior from our customers as we saw in the previous two quarters, with the exception of it just moderating based on the types of categories that are in season right now. Mary Pilkington : All right. Keep moving down our questions. Let's see, we'll go to Scott Ciccarelli at RBC. Robert Ciccarelli : So I guess I have another follow-up question on the side lots since that seems to be the initiative that you guys are expecting to have the biggest impact on your business. Can you tell us what percent of sales today comes from the side lot? And just related to that, is your expectation that your sales maybe reaches your in-store levels? Or would you expect that, given the nature of those side lots, to continue to lag what you generate in the store? Kurt Barton : Yes. Scott, this is Kurt. In the side lot, I think the important thing to remember is that the side lot today, you've walked it, it's productive. It has a portion of it that you'd view as storage for that large, bulky agricultural-type equipment. And so some of that product outside, is inside other areas, we don't get specific to the productivity of the side lot pre or post on this initiative in there. What we see is a great opportunity for that product itself to be able to sell at or at a greater pace in the modified reduced space for the ag equipment and then reallocate that space to create that environment that's a shopping -- an actual pleasant shopping experience, a convenient shopping experience, leverage it even for the drive-through aspect of the business to capitalize on convenience.  And so it's -- one, it's very early, so it's hard for us to go and say here's what it would -- the productivity is going to be like. But it's also more of a holistic store productivity view for us. And that's how we encourage you to look at it as the convenience that it drives and the new categories that Seth talked about. And what you see in our projections of the stepped-up comps in a normal post-COVID is a primary indicator as you work the number of stores that we roll this out, you can see the level between fusion and side lot and what that's going to be doing to drive productivity in our existing space today.  And we will certainly have more opportunity to share as these first rounds of stores really begin over the next 6, 9 months to show us some true trends in that business. But you certainly can see the excitement of what it does holistically for the store. Mary Pilkington : Okay. Next up on our Q&A is Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : So my question is what are some of the buckets that you have the flexibility to spend on. Should significant upside remain to your current plan? And I asked this because it seems like you're pretty flexible or nimble on marketing spend the last few quarters and how simply that helps with new customer acquisition. Harry Lawton : Yes. Matt, I'm going to turn it over to Rob here in just a minute to talk a little about technology. And I think that's one of the areas that we've really shown a significant amount of flexibility this year. As you mentioned in other areas also in marketing, as soon as the pandemic kicked in, we transitioned from a dominantly kind of more traditional print-based marketing plan to a digital and television-based marketing plan as we thought that there was going to -- the consumer is going to be right to kind of open their aperture on consideration of what retailers to shop. And certainly, the new customers that we've seen have proven that hypothesis to be true.  I think Seth demonstrated a lot of agility and flexibility in digital. I'll turn to Rob to maybe talk a little bit about some of the things we've done but, importantly, a lot of the things that we have on the horizon. Robert Mills : Great. So as Hal mentioned, yes, a lot of flexibility and agility built into IT, which is not uncommon, but this year was a great example where we really leaned in and focusing on what that flexibility and agility would look like especially in the digital space. We started this year with a clear road map of improving that customer experience online, really striving to be that best-in-class, world-class omni-channel provider.  And with that, earlier and within COVID, it was obvious that our customer was adopting very quickly to digital, coming to the website, but also looking for convenience. And this is where the partnership with John's team of implementing curbside pickup very rapidly, expanding our capabilities of delivering to the customer's home very rapidly across the entire store base.  And then looking even in the future, we really have 3 core pillars. One is how do we continue to build that flexibility around finding the product, the navigation, search that will improve the quality of the traffic coming to the website as well as just making it a simpler and easier shopping experience for the customer. The second is really around that convenience factor leveraging curbside but delivering the product to the customer much more faster and efficiently with the goal of 90% of our deliveries occurring same day or within near the same day. And then lastly, really leveraging on that expertise that I've talked about earlier, providing that -- the content, the video, that know-how-to expertise for our customers, that they come to us more. We're clearly trusted with our customer base and how do we bring that through the mobile device and at all times.  You've seen throughout this year, we've changed our deployment strategy from the technology, really focused on agility where we're doing online twice a month, sometimes more frequent, new capabilities that's impacting the stores as well as within the digital space. So really excited about the technology advancements that we're making. We have flexibility to scale up through partners as well as our internal team members and aligning it to our short-term and long-term goals. Mary Pilkington : All right. Thanks so much, Matt. We'll move on to our next question that comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Daniel Imbro : I'll add my congrats to the list. Maybe a follow-up to the last answer on digital investments, how are you guys thinking about the new mobile app? Obviously, engagement looks like it's growing nicely, but is it more of a transactional tool or a research tool for your customers? And while it's only been a few months, can you maybe talk about how you're working to ensure it's truly incremental to sales and not just a channel shift? Robert Mills : Right. Do you want me to take it? Harry Lawton : Yes. Robert Mills : All right. Thanks a lot. So mobile is a key part of our strategy. It has been for several years. Our customers clearly told us mobile first is very important. We have shared in the past that majority of our site, our traffic comes through a mobile device and that's not changing. We accelerated this year the mobile device -- or the mobile application and closed it by 6 to 9 months.  And originally out of the gate, it was to provide some basic selling tools and ensure that we can provide a customer transaction and the ability to pick up within store, but we're very rapidly building on those capabilities related to convenience. And with that is also focusing on the content. So it's a little bit of both. You're going to see us clearly, we want a simple, convenient shopping experience for that customer. But at the same time, we want to always be with them. They come into our stores looking for that product expertise, that service knowledge. That's a differentiator for Tractor. You've heard us talk about how we hire our customers. We want that mobile device to always be with them, that mobile app always available. So if they have questions while they're on their property or questions about their animal or health or wellness being, how are we always there to ask and answer those questions, some through automation, some through ask the experts, so live interaction; and then also at the same time have the products available both in stores as well as at extended assortment, so they can transact.  We see both the sales coming from, in some cases, a shift; in other cases, being incremental and that's what we've seen so far. We're really pleased with the adoption. We have extreme focus and I'm really excited about what's going to be coming in the next couple of quarters with additional capabilities focusing on content and that convenience play. Mary Pilkington : Thanks, Rob. I hope everybody has downloaded the Tractor Supply app. For every download up to 1 million, we're donating $1 to the American Connection Project Broadband Coalition. And as you know, that's a real need in our rural communities, so thank you all for taking the time to download the app. Our next question comes from Brad Thomas at KeyBanc. Bradley Thomas : Congrats on the great results. I want to circle back on a question of trying to model 2021 and I recognize you're not ready to give guidance and none of us know how the top line is going to play out next year. But I was hoping we could just talk about some expense buckets that maybe we know about at this point. As I'm counting it, the wage increases roll into next year, presumably some of the COVID expenses roll into next year. You've now disclosed $12 million to $15 million of strategic growth investments in the fourth quarter. Kurt, are those now expected to roll through next year? And are there any other items that we should be thinking about that you can call out this time as we think about some of the margin or expense puts and takes for next year? Kurt Barton : Yes. Brad, that's good question. And so let me give you some of the directional information as you think about 2021. In regards to COVID, very similar to how it's framed up, how we're looking at 2021, potentially, you would anticipate, we anticipate that the expenses that we've incurred in COVID would continue but yet would likely fade as you move out of a COVID pandemic into a bit of normalcy.  On the COVID expenses, the vast majority of that is labor and supplies focused on safety, cleaning, sanitation, as John talked about. And then there's -- the lesser extent would be medical and sick-related costs and contact tracing, case management. And so you can see how as we transition out of a COVID pandemic, that those costs could dissipate in there as well.  Yes, the permanent wage benefits, we would model that into 2021. On the strategic growth initiatives, the strategy that we just laid out, the primary cost would be in the capital spend and would start to introduce into the depreciation. On the strategic initiatives that we're pointing out today, like in third quarter and even in fourth quarter, the most significant factor was the rollout of the FAST Program, which we said we would do hiring, training, all of that and we would incur that initial burden of the ramp-up of it. And some of that incurs and it's a primary factor in fourth quarter as well.  Third quarter was the next largest piece of the strategic growth initiatives we're advertising. And as Hal mentioned, that's something we may flex in or out as we anticipate. So as we talk about strategic growth initiatives in Q3 and Q4, those are something specific to the back half of the year. And going forward, it's more specific items to these strategic initiatives and may not be at those same levels and likely to be, on a quarterly basis, a level that's lesser than the $12 million to $15 million on a per-quarter basis in 2021. Harry Lawton : You want to say something about incentive compensation, Kurt, because that's a big swing. Kurt Barton : Yes. I mean certainly, incentive compensation, as you model that out, I mean, with the performance in 2021, there's record-level performance and super excited to be able to provide our team members a record level of incentive compensation. And we've talked often, the frontline team members, those in the stores, distribution centers, getting a real strong portion of that incentive compensation. But as we lap that next year, the way that our incentive plans are built, that's actually a leverage point for us in 2021. Mary Pilkington : All right. Thank you, Kurt. We'll go to Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse now. Seth Sigman : I'll add my congrats as well. I want to follow up on that last question. As we're hopefully trying to figure out if demand remains elevated here, should we be thinking about the flow-through next year in '21 being more or less favorable than this past year? And so you clearly have been spending already. Some of that may continue, but you'll also start to lap some of that, you'll lap the incentive comp, but then you'll also have some incremental investments coming in. So just to summarize, like how would we be thinking about the flow-through more or less favorable than what we've seen recently?  And then also, if you can speak specifically about the gross margin, Kurt, because you also noted some incremental pressures hitting the fourth quarter and Tractor is clearly not alone in that. But are you expecting those headwinds to continue? And how do you feel about the offsets to that, things that helped this past year like less promotional activity and all the effectiveness with discounting, would those serve as offsets next year? Kurt Barton : Okay. Yes, Seth, I think I heard two questions in there. One was a little bit of guidance and I'll stay very directional on 2021 and the flow-through. And then there was a gross margin question on Q4 and maybe a little bit on 2021. Directionally, I would guide towards staying somewhat consistent on the flow-through in 2021 principally because what you've seen and what we've seen in this environment today, with the step-up of demand that the COVID pandemic creates for all the things we talked about, the cost of doing business is also elevated. And as the demand for the product may shift as you move out of a peak COVID, so does some of the expenses that goes with it. So I'd stay somewhere in the range that you've seen in 2020, albeit 2020 is going to have a high level of flow-through. And we'll give more guidance on that on our fourth quarter call.  In regards to gross -- in the gross margin, there are some specific things as I called out the fourth quarter. And so the past 2 quarters had tremendous gross margin growth year-over-year on the rate. And fourth quarter last year, we began to see some of our benefits play out and we had our strongest gross margin performance and we'll cycle that. And there are some things that are transitory to the fourth quarter specific to it. How long some of the newer pressures in the transportation business sticks may impact 2021. And then particularly to the fourth quarter, as I pointed out, that's typically just generally a more promotional-type environment with the holiday season. So we anticipate some of the benefit of less promotional in Q2, Q3 puts pressure on the fourth quarter to be able to maintain that.  Looking out to 2021, I would just emphasize we will continue to focus on everyday low pricing benefit there and not necessarily going back to a heavier promotional. So we do anticipate focusing on maintaining as much of the gross margin rate benefit that we've seen of late go forward. Mary Pilkington : Thank you, Kurt. So we let it go just a little bit longer than our 1-hour mark for Q&A, but we'll wrap up with one final question. That question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with TAG. Joseph Feldman : Again, I'll offer congratulations on the quarter and a good event. So I wanted to wrap up with which categories do you think you see the most opportunity for, from the analytics and technology that you're talking about and Project Fusion, not just product categories but space within the stores. As I'm thinking about it, I'm just trying to think like is apparel your biggest opportunity, where there's most upside? Or what are those kind of categories we should look for?  And then if I could kind of tie this together with another question on pets was -- and I apologize if I missed it, but I don't think I heard the word Petsense at all today and I'm just wondering what you're thinking about that. Harry Lawton : Yes. So I'll take the Petsense piece and then I'll turn it to Seth. And Seth, maybe you can walk through kind of the merchandising category portfolio strategy and kind of the 6 kind of must-wins that your team is focused on. Seth Estep : Yes, absolutely. Harry Lawton : Yes. So Petsense, the business is doing very well. It's -- it too is benefiting from kind of the strength in pet adoption and pet humanization. The management team is doing well. We feel really good about the business. It is continuing to grow. It's reasonably immaterial to the overall Tractor Supply portfolio and size and scale. And kind of more to come, I guess, on Petsense, but the Petsense business is doing very well. We're really pleased with it. Seth, I'll turn it over to you to maybe talk a little bit about our category strategies and where we're really focusing. Seth Estep : Yes, absolutely. So yes, we talked a little bit earlier about some of the category strategies that we're going after. And over the course of -- it actually -- it was -- really started this process even, call it, pre-COVID and then just continued to assess the opportunity as we've gone throughout this COVID environment.  And there's really five fundamental areas that we're focused in on. First and foremost, we are going to win at pet and animal. We think we still have a significant opportunity to not only maintain our market-leading status in things like large animal feed that Hal talked about earlier but also continue to gain share there as well, really not only going with our product assortment in stores but some of the convenience play, the digital piece, delivery, et cetera.  Pet is the other piece of that as well. Our customers love their animals. They love pet. We look at that and we know we have the ability to continue not only win with new customers but win with that share of wallet. And so we're -- our goal there is, first and foremost, win in pet and animal.  The second piece to that is going to be in how do we become that authority in lawn and garden out here. We've talked a lot about that today as we look at our exterior space as well as just some of those categories that we're going to go after. And you'll -- and what we've seen so far just in the limit of obviously early in the garden center test. But it's not only as we've gone after the garden center to see that product sell, we've seen the product sell obviously throughout all the seasonal department that's inside as well as some of those secondary categories like workwear, things of that nature have seen some really, really strong lift. We're going to continue to capitalize again on backyarding activity, right? We're going to make sure we leverage our drive aisle, our space, all focused in on the customer, right? And it's what the customer is doing, where they're going and how can we continue to respond to those things for them. And then we're going to also go after market share in like tools, DIY as well as workwear that we talked about. You just look at the total addressable market, you look at our store count, you look at the opportunity that we have, you look at the trends that our consumers are coming to us for to start to consolidate some of those trips and we believe that we have just a significant opportunity to not only maintain our status in some of our traditional core categories but also continue to expand that through some of those other categories as well and really grow and win there.  You'll see that come to life throughout the store. You'll see it in Project Fusion. Talked a little bit about store clustering, we're looking at that on a store-by-store, region-by-region, state-by-state basis. But in a nutshell, we want to really focus in on the lifestyle we serve and the categories that we go after, just making sure that we are there for them and their needs, so they can live kind of that life on their terms. Mary Pilkington : Great. Well, that's going to be our final question. I want to thank everyone who took the time to call in today. As always, those were some great questions.  I also wanted to take a minute to thank the Tractor Supply IR and PR team who worked so tirelessly behind the scenes on this event. Marianne Denenberg, Mackenzie Goldman and Lindsey Mitchell, I appreciate all your efforts.  And thanks to all of you for taking time out of your day to join us virtually. We look forward to speaking to you again on our fourth quarter 2020 call in late January. Take care and please stay safe.",

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you enjoy the opening video. We will all, always remember 2020. And while we'll never recall the year with anything close to fondness, at Tractor Supply, 2020 will be remembered with a small measure of pride, as we reflect on our efforts to take care of our fellow team members, support our customers and invest in the future. None of these results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our team. And I want to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply team members, for how they have lived our mission values and work together to take care of each other and our customers. My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business. The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall, before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health, and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide a contact tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021. In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages, and broader benefits offerings. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities. And we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward. As we talk now shifting and talking about 2021, we believe there is as much uncertainty this year, as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year? Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021, based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm that we shared with you, at our Enhanced Earnings Event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our Life Out Here Strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic, stronger than before. Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continue to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth. For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year, a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent, across all periods of the quarter, across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth were seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers. Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers, as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day next day delivery. We also re-launched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over one million downloads. We celebrated the opening of our 1,900 store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan. We just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our Life Out Here Strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long-term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pre-tax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner [ph] As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense. Earlier this week, we named Matthew Rubin as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time. Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook, before I return to give you an update on our Life Out Here Strategy. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply, as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you in the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customer\u2019s desire for product categories that support the Out Here Lifestyle, as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences. For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor fire pits, along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self-reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird feeding had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customer\u2019s behavior. The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience, same-day delivery and our private label credit card. Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year. We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad based strength, with safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points. Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors. First, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter, and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers, as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum. During the quarter, we issued our first ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issues were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5 times. Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio. Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning our \u2013 for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%. For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis. Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021, as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our field activity support team program, while the fast program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each. Breaking down SG&A, the leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business. As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020, as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels. Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million, while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here Strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business. For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here Strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. Now I'll turn it back to Hal. Harry Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. So now let's shift into 2021. As Kurt said, we're laser-focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways. One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us. Second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers, and the third is executing our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail. We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shop with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings. The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here Strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here strategy. The first is the liver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the tractor way, the fourth is go to country model for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return. So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID. Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from, primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state of the art outside garden feed and farm shopping center. That also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store - of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales. Another initiative we have is our FAST team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales, and we're very pleased with the FAST rollout. We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations. We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are shipped from store, search engine optimization, payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay, subscriptions, both online and in-store and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform. As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program by mid-year. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention. And also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's Club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you. Now just stepping back, we're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences, whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or home setting with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring Chick Days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on trend category. Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we are focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across, 150 stores to 200 stores and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store, through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on-demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow Tractor Supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers, pets, whether in-store or online. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring. In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from, and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger, transform company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. I hope everyone is well and healthy, first of all. Second, I do appreciate you guys providing guidance, obviously not easy given the amount of uncertainty in the environment. But with that being said, I was hoping you guys could help us better understand how you went about constructing your topline expectations? And maybe outline a couple of your key inputs or assumptions? Thanks. Harry Lawton : Hey, Scot. It's Hal Lawton, and good to speak with you this morning. I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter. And I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us, will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky irregardless of COVID. And so, we kind of see those two coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then, as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile [Technical Difficulty] guided between minus 2 and plus 1. So it is a heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels, but with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters. Scot Ciccarelli : I appreciate that, Hal. And how much \u2013 obviously, the macro trends, we actually agree with that assessment. But how much of your expectation is from some of the company specific initiatives, the Side Lots, some of the store remodels? Or is it just kind of all thrown together in a mixing goal there? Thanks. Harry Lawton : Yes. We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that, at these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid single digit comp environment. But I will say that it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the Board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that - give us that sense. First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due in part, due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a significant - the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in one year last year, including 11 million new customers and six million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are for the new customers are holding - have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs. And then, last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members. And you look like our customer SAT scores, our - if you look at the customers perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping and Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store. So, it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around Fusion and Sidelight [ph] and FAST, are adding to the share - creating - helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing. Operator : And your next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Your line is open. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the strategic review of Petsense? And what came out of that review that resulted in the decision to slow the growth of new stores? It just seems like with pat ownership at all-time highs, unless those stores were significantly underperforming the company average, just kind of wondering what some of the specifics were of that review? Harry Lawton : Yes. Hi, Elizabeth and good morning. Yes. This was just completing my first year as the CEO of Tractor Supply. And so just kind of normal course, kind of steps back and did a strategic review of Petsense, right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The business - the net takeaway is where the business is doing well. But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the - kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business, on our balance sheet. And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader, for the Petsense business, and we are - we will continue to invest in Petsense, as we see opportunities. And it's - as I said, the business is doing well. We do think its gaining share, in the specialty space. And we will continue to support that business and moving forward, just at a lower long-term store count target. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. And could you potentially shift more of the sales in that business online, if you're not going to grow the store count to quite as much as you thought. Like, do you just view a shift towards the e-commerce side of the business as a way to expand into new markets? Harry Lawton : Yes. I look forward to sharing with you more about the Petsense strategy as Matthew comes in and has an opportunity to engage and chart the future of the company. And we're very pleased with the performance. The stores are doing well. The website is doing well. As you said, Liz, we do know pet online is doing well. You can look at the industry data, and that's certainly something I know Matthew is going to - we'll be looking into as a way to accelerate our efforts there. So, more to come. Operator : Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. Congratulations on a great year. I wanted to just talk a little bit about the three or five-year algorithm. You had originally called out 9% to 9.5% operating margins. Your fiscal \u201821 bottom end range is already 30 basis points higher than that algorithm. So I guess, what would make the range, I guess, decrease in \u201822 and beyond? And I guess, maybe asked a slightly different way, when I look at that 9% to 9.5% range, that would imply flat operating profit growth in 2022, and that doesn't seem likely scenario? Kurt Barton : Hey, Karen. This is Kurt. Yes, thank you for the question. And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is, we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that, was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually of low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean, the inventory, at some point, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer. And we anticipate this year in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that, that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price. We're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes. There's some anticipated risk with gross margin. So, we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share. And our outlook for 2021 and the long-term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility as things change. Karen Short : Okay. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up is looking at the comp in 2Q to 4Q, obviously, as you have said and we all see, you had very evenly kind of split composition on the comp from 2Q to 4Q. How do you think about when we start to lap those in 2021, do you think the pressure will come more from ticket or traffic in terms of the comp comparisons? Kurt Barton : Yes. It's a great question. As we think about traffic and ticket in 2021, there's a lot of variables and still some uncertainty as we begin to lap that. We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers, certainly some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic, as areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation, as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand. And if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic. So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both has variables that could drive it up or down. Operator : And your next question will come from Steve Forbes from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Steve Forbes : Good morning. So I wanted to start, Hal, with the new and reengaged customer trends, right, you mentioned repeat rates at all-time highs, just curious if you can provide more color here, right? Are these customers engaging at a level that's more comparable to your Neighbor's Club members? Are they shopping across more categories right than the average customer, shopping both channels, right? And why aren't we seeing greater, I guess, entrants into the Neighbor's Club Loyalty Program, as I would imagine, that's sort of a core initiative right for 2021? Harry Lawton : Yes. Hey, Steve, and good morning. A couple of things I'll say. First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that - I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very - we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it. As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's two or three points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not - we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of two months at the 56 day count and at three months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden, and if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer SAT scores are higher than historic as well. So, I'd say all around, we are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year, particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there face-to-face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So, the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year, we're very pleased with and then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior. Steve Forbes : Thanks, Hal. And maybe just a quick follow-up. As we try to conceptualize the opportunity here, how does the 11 million new customers and 6 million reengaged customers compare to 2018 or 2019 levels? Harry Lawton : I don't think we've disclosed that in the past. But what I will say is - and we'll get that some thought on whether to do so. But what I would say is there are material increases from previous years. Steve Forbes : Awesome. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Stay well. Harry Lawton : Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : And your next question will come from Peter Benedict from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Peter Benedict : Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, first question, Kurt, you kind of mentioned inflation at \u201821. And I'm just curious where you're seeing that most acutely off [ph] and size it up, but which categories you're seeing inflation in the business? That's my first question. Harry Lawton : Peter, I'm going to let Seth take that. Seth Estep : Hey, Peter, this is Seth. Hey Peter, as we look at some of the inflation of this coming year and what we're seeing kind of early on, if you just look at the kind of base commodity markets that are out there, I'd tell you early reads. Our steel-based product as well as some of the grain-based goods, if you look at those commodity markets. Feel really good about the handle that the team has on the business to be able to manage it accordingly with our tolls that we have on the pricing side. But those would be the areas that I would say that we're starting to see those come through in the early reads. Peter Benedict : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe, Hal, one for you. Just on the competitive environment out there. Obviously, it's been strong. But even with the strength in farm and ranch, and in the pet area, we're seeing some reasonably large chains have trouble and even shut down within both of those areas. So, I'm just curious as you've got a lot of strategic initiatives in place. But is the competitive environment shifting in a way that maybe has you thinking differently on any maybe longer term initiatives over the next couple of years? Just kind of curious your view on that. I know you got a lot on your plate, but just wanted to hear you add on that. Harry Lawton : Yes. Thanks, Peter. And what I'd say is the \u2013 I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off, people are struggling with in-stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job, managing inventory through the year. We saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We planned for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit. So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there, anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment. And we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curb side pickup, and you can do same-day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well. So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean, we're \u2013 and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores and that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. I mean, if you look at our CUE business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's \u2013 and you think about the proxy \u2013 using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories. And certainly, a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model to track or the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience. Mary Pilkington : Michelle, let me just say one thing, if I may. I know we're at the top of the hour, but we're going to let the call go about 10 minutes longer. Thank you. Operator : Okay. So your next question comes from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. And Mary Winn, thanks for letting the call run a little bit longer and I'll try to be quick. So I was wondering if \u2013 and maybe I missed it, but the percentage of the new customers, I know we talked about this a little bit that are purchasing CUE and then the percentage of those that are repeating. I'm not sure I got that data and if you're willing to give us that data. Kurt Barton : Yes. Scott, how are you? Good morning. Scott Mushkin : Good morning. Harry Lawton : We have not mentioned what percent are buying CUE in their first purchase. We did mention what percent are coming back and buying a second time. So about 20% of our new customers return and shop with us again within 28 days. And we said that's above historic run rates by several points. So we feel very good about our retention of these customers. And that's a proxy at one-time marker, but it's the same if you look across 7, 14 days, 2 months, 3 months, et cetera. As it relates to what they're buying on their first purchase, the 2 dominant areas that they're buying on their first purchase are pet, pet food or poultry and or supplies and such around those two categories. Scott Mushkin : And so that's interesting. And I can be my follow-up. I was going to actually add something else. But a 20% repeat rate sounds high, but if it's skewing towards CUE, you might think you can actually make that number higher. Are there any initiatives to figure out how to make sure they're repeating at a higher rate if they're engaged in CUE and then our yield [ph]. Harry Lawton : Yes, absolutely. So this is what the full focus of our marketing team is focused on, is exactly this, is we've got - we've invested over the last 1.5 year or two in our CRM capabilities, moving that platform to the Azure cloud, upgrading our analytical capabilities, adding new personalization tooling in place and also looking at behaviors, whether on the site or inside of the store and then looking for kind of like comparing them to look like shoppers. And so whether it's e-mails that those new customers get or whether it's digital banner ads, we're retargeting them. All those sorts of kind of marketing channels and vehicles are being used to engage with these customers and encourage them to re-shop with us. And in addition, obviously, we just have the investments we're making in our team members, the investments we're making in our store experience, the investments we're making in inventory and those sorts of things that drive repeat behavior as well. One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service; those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During the midst of the pandemic over the last 6 months, the number one and number two criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail, have I seen those two criteria at the top of a customer\u2019s decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas. And I highlighted the tens of millions of dollars we've spent on those areas in the last quarter. Operator : And your next question will come from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Peter Keith : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Great results, guys. Quick follow-up to Peter Benedict\u2019s question on the inflation. Certainly, a lot of the commodities are ramping up to record levels we haven't seen in 9 to 10 years, would you have an inflation benefit factored into comp? And if so, could you provide that for us? Kurt Barton : Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. In regards to inflation, let me first start with what we've seen here in 2020. I mean, we saw a bit of elevation as we worked our way through the year. In Q4, we still saw a bit of a modest level of inflation, less than 100 basis points of commodity inflation into the product cost. We anticipate that as all of the inflation information, as I know everyone's seen is certainly at higher levels. We're anticipating that to accelerate in 2021. We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly. So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 and are a number of scenarios. But in our guidance, we assume that over the year, a weighted average of about 1% to 2% inflation into the product cost and that certainly could vary first half versus second half of the year. And right now, we're seeing the points that Seth mentioned on grains and steel being primary drivers of some inflation at this point. So as we picked up an assumption, that range of about 1% to 2% is where we landed in our assumption. Peter Keith : Okay. Very helpful. And maybe committing over to a question for Hal or Seth, on the pet trends. Everyone knows 2020 was a record year for pet adoption and acquisition, but what are you guys seeing out there in the field? Are you seeing continued strength? And what would you expect in for \u201821? There's arguments if there's been a pull-forward and the acquisitions will drop-off or there's other arguments that the same adoption trends are going to continue for the year. Harry Lawton : Yes. We are planning for the pet category to continue to remain strong, and to over-perform relative to our overall business in the year. I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream, given that they have a 7, 8 year lifespan. Obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow are only going to \u2013 they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more, as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that \u2013 the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side. And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year, as people continue to work-from-home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed, they're getting them a new bed. All those things, I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels, as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omnichannel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online picked up in store. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 more pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers. So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess, I neglected also mentioned topologies is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year, we have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet. And it's - its systemic mean, it's always on and we do spike it at certain periods. But it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that. We've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months. Operator : And you next\u2026 Mary Pilkington : We'll call this our final question, as we wrap up the call. Operator : Okay. Perfect. So Chuck Grom, is your final question for today from with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Chuck Grom : Good morning. Nice quarter and a great first year, Hal. My questions on Side Lot, it seems like a tremendous opportunity for you guys. I'm curious, how you plan to approach it from a marketing perspective? And also how quickly you think it's going to take the ramp-up to optimal profit productivity levels? Harry Lawton : Yes, hey, Chuck. We are - remain very bullish, on the Side Lot project. It's - as we remarked before, garden is the category that our customers say they most participate in that we don't fully address their needs. And in the Side Lot that we have open, we - the customer engagement with the product and the purchase rate, it was - it's kind of like an overnight switch. Once that's all - when the project is complete and the product is in there, we saw really strong engagement with customers. And this is in the midst of fall and winter when, live goods assortments are very limited and gardening activities is much less. So we've got over 50 of these Side Lots, in - underway right now. Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some were in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100 plus more \u2013 100 plus more scheduled for the year. And we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's in the context of COVID you've got, construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks, if one of the team members on the project is test positive. You've got city municipalities that getting permitting done is very difficult. Getting someone to come out and do a certificate of occupancy is much slower. And the team is just doing an excellent job managing through, all those twists and turns. We're very - we remain very bullish on Side Lot. And like, I said, a number of them underway. I just visited a handful of them in the last week and really excited to have our first batch of them opened in time for the spring season. Chuck Grom : That's great. And just as a follow-up, I believe that the garden center pad is going to be about 4,000 square feet. When you compare that to - when you compare that productivity opportunity to what your stores typically do today, any sense or what you think that can eventually generate over time? Harry Lawton : It's very seasonal. And in my experience elsewhere, the garden centers are very productive, if not more productive than they store, during the core spring season. And then in the winter time, the productivity falls off well below the core of the store. And so, we're looking forward to having a full year ahead of us with these projects to be able to get a sense for what's the max productivity in the midst of spring. How much can we prop the productivity up with things like Christmas trees, and pumpkins, and harvest type stuff in the fall? And then, we'll see where it plays out for the full year. But we are very confident that it will drive significant productivity relative to how the space is being used now and will drive strong shareholder returns. The question is to what magnitude. And we'll know more as we get into spring. Mary Pilkington : All right. Thank you, Operator. This will conclude our call today. And thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter call in April. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2021 is off to a great start for Tractor Supply. I\u2019m extremely proud and appreciative of the hard work by the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. Once again, they took care of each other and tirelessly served our customers who depend on us to live the Out Here lifestyle. I also want to thank all of our supply chain and vendor partners. We\u2019ve been operating in the COVID-19 environment for over a year now, and the Tractor Supply system has more than risen to the occasion as they strive to serve our mission and values every single day. While we anticipated that we would have our strongest growth of the year in the first quarter, our results were significantly ahead of our expectations. When you couple this performance with the continuing momentum we are seeing in the second quarter, the positive macro environment and our strong customer trends, we are adjusting our comp outlook to mid to high single-digit growth in 2021. Kurt will share more details on the improved financial outlook for the year across our key financial metrics. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. We continue to incur significant incremental expense for items like paid time-off, mask and testing. We remain committed to following the advice of the CDC and other medical professionals to protect our team and customers. As we enter the vaccination phase, we are committed to helping our team members who choose to get vaccinated to do so. We are providing a onetime payment of $50 and allowing time-off as needed for all team members who elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccines. To further alleviate the barriers to receiving a vaccine, we have partnered with a third-party provider to facilitate on-site vaccination at our eight distribution centers and store support center. During the quarter, we also announced our entry into an agreement to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home, a retailer with 167 stores across 11 states. This is an exciting step for Tractor Supply as we look to expand our footprint in the Midwest with the high-quality assets of Orscheln Farm and Home. We have always had great respect for Barry Orscheln and team for the strong connection they have with customers in the communities they serve, along with their industry knowledge and capabilities. With our shared values and passion for the Out Here lifestyle, we look forward to bringing together our highly complementary cultures and teams to realize the long-term value and benefit that we expect this acquisition to deliver over time. As we previously disclosed, we received a second request from the FTC as part of their review of the transaction and are cooperating with that confidential review. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transition at this time. I hope you all saw our release this week with our updated ESG tear sheet for 2020, which provides new and updated performance metrics in context related to our environmental sustainability efforts, our commitment to our team members and communities and corporate governance. This report helps us provide detailed information and progress on our ESG journey. In addition, we laid out our commitment to provide new targets in the fall this year as it relates to our greenhouse gas emission plan and our aspirational goals for diversity, equity inclusion. These initiatives make great business sense for Tractor Supply. As a purpose-driven company, setting targets for ourselves creates long-term value and our potential to have a positive impact on the world. We remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. Now, let\u2019s turn to the business review for the first quarter of 2021. We had exceptional net sales gains of 42.5%, with comparable store sales up 38.6%. We materially benefited in the quarter from transitory factors such as stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. Importantly, however, the underlying foundation of our business is robust, and we\u2019re gaining share across all categories, online and in stores and also with existing customers and new customers. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club membership reached 20 million members strong. This is an important milestone for our loyalty program as we know that they are customers that shop us more frequently and they spend more money with us. We saw 2.5 million new customers shop with us in the quarter. And that\u2019s an increase of over 30% over last year. Reengaged customers also exhibited strong growth, up over 12% from the first quarter of 2020. And customer retention for both our new and reengaged customers continues to run above last year. We saw strong growth across all product categories and geographic regions of the country. Comps for each month of the quarter were above 30%. And our growth was well-balanced between transactions and ticket growth. The business, like the last few quarters, continues to be a very consistent and stable. For the fourth quarter, our e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did last year to improve our omnichannel capabilities continues to resonate with our customers. Ongoing improvements to the customer experience for better search capabilities and enhanced personalization are being recognized by our customers. As we\u2019ve experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to see strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories with growth in the mid-20% range. More specifically, we continue to be very encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing within our pet and poultry categories, where we\u2019re driving shopping frequency and market share gains. Over the last 15 months, our unaided brand awareness scores are up 17 percentage points. I believe these type of metrics serve as leading indicators of our brand health and future spending patterns of our customers. We continue to execute our shift away from print advertising to brand building and digital marketing. We\u2019re currently airing our national TV spring advertising campaign that highlights the strength of Tractor Supply\u2019s offering to serve the seasonal needs of our customers to take care of their land, pets and animals. Overall, the strong first quarter highlighted the unique advantages that we have at Tractor Supply. Our team members delivered exceptional results in a generation-defining moment. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. We\u2019re excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revisions to our guidance for the year. Our record first quarter earnings were driven by positive momentum in all areas of the business. Comp sales increased 38.6% as the trends we experienced over the past year continued throughout the first quarter of 2021. Traffic increased 21%, and average ticket grew 17.6%. All geographic areas reported sales gains of at least 30% positive comparison to last year. Big ticket purchases had robust growth, up strong double digits that well outpaced our average comp sales increase. Safes, fencing, utility vehicles, trailers and outdoor power equipment, such as the zero-turn mowers, were some of the notable gainers in the quarter. As Hal mentioned, we did benefit from more transitory factors like stimulus payments, favorable weather and inflation that had a positive impact on the sales in the quarter. In total, we estimate that about one-third of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter is attributable to these transitory factors. Our best estimate is that more favorable weather for the quarter contributed about 400 basis points to comps. Both January and February were colder than last year, with February being the coldest month in 30 years, while the last few weeks of March turned to a favorable spring weather in many of our markets. We also saw retail price inflation, primarily in commodities, which contributed around 300 basis points to our comp sales performance. The impact of stimulus payments is more difficult to quantify, but we recognize that consumers had more cash to spend during the quarter, and we believe Tractor Supply benefited from this in Q1. Towards the end of the quarter, in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw customer spending at elevated levels, especially in big ticket items. Our best estimate is that stimulus contributed somewhere in the mid-single digits to our first quarter sales comps. Even factoring in the transitory benefits, we believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. Trends towards higher spending and consumables continued through the quarter with pet, bird and livestock feeds showing significant growth from last year. We saw growth in the quarter despite lapping last year\u2019s strong stock up buying that occurred late in the first quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. As we\u2019ve said for the past few quarters, we see the growth in our CUE categories as more evidence of an enduring consumer shift to higher pet adoptions and ownership, new customer hobbies like backyard poultry and gardening, along with trip consolidation. For the first quarter, our gross margin increased by 148 basis points to 35.2% of sales, which resulted in gross profit increasing to nearly $984 million in the first quarter. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. Consistent with the trends since the beginning of the pandemic, this quarter\u2019s increase was primarily driven by a lower level of sales promotions and clearance activity. We also benefited from a positive product mix towards higher-margin categories. And consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points of benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams, or FAST initiative. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs, which was a headwind for gross margin. Domestic and import freight costs have increased significantly as well as fuel costs. And we expect these trends to continue throughout 2021. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 27%, an improvement of 103 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the strong increase in our comparable store sales. This leverage was partially offset by three factors : Higher incentive compensation, given the strong sales performance; COVID-related costs; and higher operating expenses to support the elevated volumes. COVID-related costs were approximately $28 million, generally in line with prior quarters, as we continue to take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of our team members and customers. Additional overtime, temporary labor and other costs were also incurred to maintain high service levels. Operating profit dollars more than doubled compared to prior year to $231 million, an operating profit margin of 8.3%, an improvement of 251 basis points. Net income was $181 million, an increase of 117%. Diluted EPS was $1.55, representing an increase of 118% versus the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter, we returned $314 million to shareholders through the combination of our share repurchases and dividends. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 2% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business. And we are working with our suppliers and our vendors to build stock to support this momentum. The added supply chain costs and freight expense necessary to rebuild inventory is reflected in our updated guidance we provided. Moving now to our guidance for 2021. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. We continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes, remaining nimble and adjusting as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results from the first quarter and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second quarter. While the current environment and momentum are both favorable, we recognize that COVID-19 pandemic is not completely behind us and that economic conditions can change quickly. Please keep in mind that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5% to 8%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.4% to 9.7% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.05 to $7.40. This compares to our previous earnings range of $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. Compared to our initial outlook for the year, our forecast does reflect higher transportation costs and product inflation. We experienced increasing pressures from these factors during the first quarter and expect them to continue to be a headwind throughout 2021. In addition, we have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers\u2019 expectations. I want to share additional context on our outlook for the second quarter. While we begin to lap more challenging sales and earnings comps, we currently see sales momentum continue, partially fueled by stimulus payments. We expect a positive sales comp in the second quarter in the mid-single-digit range. Please keep in mind, we\u2019ll be cycling our strongest gross margin performance of the prior year in Q2, where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as a favorable product mix. We are expecting gross margin decline in Q2 due to higher transportation costs, a less favorable product mix and a slight return to promotional activity. We also anticipate a modest onetime headwind in the second quarter relating to the rollout of our enhanced Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program. In terms of SG&A for the second quarter, COVID-related expenses are expected to moderate from the Q1 levels, but are forecasted to be slightly higher than original expectations entering the year, along with higher labor cost to support these elevated volumes. For the second half of 2021, we anticipate tailwinds such as stimulus payments to moderate and performance to be more in line with our original guidance, expecting a modest decline in comp sales. Longer term, we continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. As I\u2019ve stated before, a key component of our financial model is the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. In January, we increased our annual dividend by 30% from $0.40 a share to $0.52. For 2021, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. In summary, it is an exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and see positive momentum carrying into the second quarter. We see an opportunity to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers by investing in our business to maintain everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thank you, Kurt. I\u2019d like to spend the next portion of the call covering some of the key customer trends we\u2019re seeing in the business, providing an update on our Life Out Here strategy and highlighting our spring programs. Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth. These types of trends can simply be described as once in a generation. We\u2019re seeing growth in all our customer segments and across all value tiers of spending with strong retention of existing and new customers. The fastest growth customer segment is our core farm and ranch. This segment is very healthy as rural economies, for the most part, were less impacted by the pandemic and are recovering at a steeper and more robust rate. Importantly, we\u2019re gaining wallet share with our core customer as our highest and medium spend customer tiers are outpacing our lower spend customer tier. As mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong new customer growth and notably, are also seeing strong customer retention. As an example, for our new customers from the first quarter of 2020 last year, more than 50% have returned to shop with Tractor Supply. This is about 300 basis points higher than the cohort from the first quarter of 2019. We are seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve seen a 400 basis-point shift in the customer age cohorts of 18 to 45 years old. This demographic has long resisted many of the traditional generational norms, things like household formation and homeownership. But, the pandemic has shocked this generation and accelerated their embracement of these types of activities. There continues to be a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by the millennial segment. The most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in this customer segment has staying power and could be a structural game changer for us. Another structural customer trend that is working to our advantage is the significant increase in pet-owning households and number of pets adopted. Compared to the overall U.S. household pet ownership of approximately two-thirds, our customers over-index in pet ownership by about 10 points. And our current survey work with our customers indicate 25% have recently acquired and adopted a new pet. New companion animal ownership acts as an annuity for our business as these puppies and kittens grow up and have growing life cycle needs. We\u2019re also uniquely positioned to offer a growing menu of services such as pet wash, vet clinics, prescriptions and televet services. Whether it is more food treats, toys, containment and more, the humanization of pet provides us with future opportunities for growth. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the numerous tailwinds, such as pet ownership, the millennial urban exodus, backyard poultry, home standing and home as an oasis. We believe many of these consumer trends will be enduring shifts well into the future. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever and we\u2019re investing to ensure we continue to play offense in the context of these trends. We are making excellent progress on our Life Out Here strategy and initiatives. At the beginning of April, we announced the relaunch of our Neighbor\u2019s Club program to be even bigger and better. When we launched Neighbor\u2019s Club nationwide in 2017, our vision was to create a unique Out Here community for our customers and a place for them to connect with us. The Neighbor\u2019s Club has permitted us to show appreciation to our loyal customers and to accumulate actionable customer data that has allowed us to deliver to our customers more relevant and personalized communications. Over the last four years, our loyalty program has served us well to be able to thank participating customers for being loyal customers, provide rewards and special offers they value, learn more about their purchasing trends and interest and ultimately, increase customer loyalty to Tractor Supply stores. Today, our Neighbor\u2019s Club program has over 20 million members and is comprised of our most valuable customers. It is a perfect time to upgrade the program with the introduction of points and three tiers of status. Now, neighbors, can earn points on their purchases and redeem them for more rewards. They can earn their way to different levels, so that when they spend, they earn more. With the new features of Neighbor\u2019s Club, we believe we have more tools and features than ever to help facilitate upward migration and spending and mitigate downward migration of spending by our members. The changes to Neighbor\u2019s Club were specifically based on our customers\u2019 feedback. The new rewards and benefits of Neighbor\u2019s Club are relevant to the customers\u2019 lifestyle, such as trailer rentals and shipping benefits. We believe with the new Neighbor\u2019s Club benefits, we have an opportunity to support our customers in a more meaningful way. This, in turn, will provide us a platform for multiyear trajectory for growth as a clear business driver for us. More broadly, we are aggressively advancing our Life Out Here strategy. The FAST team is at scale and providing significant improvement in the execution of our merchandising initiatives. We continue to forecast about 150 to 200 Side Lot transformations to occur this year. As of today, we have over 40 stores operating and continue to refine our learnings for future build-outs, of which 35 are currently under construction. Project Fusion store remodels are also on track for completion of 150 to 200 stores this year. In addition, new stores are being built as Fusion stores with improved layout, signage, SKU expansion and adjacencies. While still early, we\u2019re very pleased with our customers\u2019 response to both the Side Lot transformation and the Project Fusion store layout. Now turning to spring. Our stores in e-commerce are well positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. We remain committed to being the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. We have substantially expanded our assortment in grilling, raised bed garden and other backyard categories. And to capture share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we have expanded our offerings on core products, like long handled tools, wheelbarrows, trailers and tillers. And Chick Days are underway with millions of customers relying on us for their poultry passions. Leveraging our localization efforts, we\u2019re expanding our tool crow to an additional 400 stores. And on the product innovation front, with Carhartt to open a new store within a store concept. This concept was created with our customer at the center of the shopping experience. And by partnering with Carhartt to double our selection, our stores have even more of what makes Tractor Supply a destination for workwear. The new store within a store concept will roll out in more than 100 Tractor Supply stores in 2021 with additional stores to be added next year. To wrap up, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the Tractor Supply team as they\u2019ve remained agile in the face of a very challenging operating environment. My thanks and appreciation go out to each of them for helping to take care of each other and our customers, while operating in a record-setting pace. We have an incredibly strong business and foundation. We see more positive macro factors than we did at the beginning of the year. Customers are shopping with us in record numbers, and we\u2019re investing in multiple initiatives to retain them and provide more reasons to shop with us in the future. We participate in a large and attractive market that we\u2019re working to expand further with initiatives such as Side Lot that will add to our product offering. By doing the right thing for our team members and customers, we\u2019re executing our Life Out Here strategy and building a stronger company for our shareholders. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. All the new customer statistics are very helpful. Can you give us a sense for where you think those customers were shopping before Tractor Supply, or is it more likely they\u2019re just new to the farm and ranch retail industry, and as a result, you\u2019re grabbing a disproportionate share of those incremental new customers? And as part of that, can you give us a sense for how many of those new customers are shopping in the CUE categories, such that you think you\u2019ll be able to get those customers in the sustainable patterns of repeat purchases? Hal Lawton : Yes. Good morning, Michael, and thanks for your question. As you mentioned, we\u2019ve seen a significant amount of new customers shopping with us over the last 12-plus months with above-average retention rates continuing to hold. And as we mentioned, over 50% of the Q1 2020 cohort has shopped us again in the last 12 months. So, very strong retention. When we look at the additional customer data, I\u2019d highlight two big drivers of the new customers. First would be in the core farm and ranch. And that very much is a market share gain, where these are customers that have land, have animals, have had -- our value proposition has appealed to them over time. And for a variety of reasons, they\u2019re choosing to now shop with Tractor Supply. And I think that has a lot to do with the investments we\u2019ve made in technology, the investments we\u2019ve made in safety and health and cleanliness in our stores and certainly, the focus we\u2019ve had on inventory and customer service. And then, the second thing I\u2019d bring up is kind of the millennial customer, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. This segment had a very large increase as a percentage of our sales in Q1. And really, when we look at the data, it really is around the migration of people out of urban environments into suburban and rural environments. And that generation\u2019s starting to kind of take -- form households, buy homes, and as part of that, the Out Here lifestyle is part of the aspiration that they have when they moved out to the suburbia or when they moved out to rural America. And we do really feel like this is a structural trend that will continue to provide growth for us as we look out the balance of this year and beyond. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, if you unpack the math of your 5% to 8% comp guidance for the year, coupled with a mid-single-digit comp for the second quarter, it suggests that you\u2019ll run down, call it, 10% in the back half, at the midpoint of the range, which would be about 1,000 basis-point differential from where you\u2019re going to run in the second quarter on a -- at least, on a arithmetic two-year stack basis, even though the math gets all confusing at this point. Is it right to think that your -- the difference is all going to come from -- you\u2019re getting about 1,000 basis points of stimulus benefit in 2Q, and you probably won\u2019t get that in 3Q or 4Q, or is it more inflation? Weather -- how are you thinking about what\u2019s unique around the second quarter versus not necessarily in the back half? Kurt Barton : Yes. Michael, this is Kurt. In regards to your question, I\u2019d really point to two things. We just finished first quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we recognize that in this environment, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty. We\u2019ve got better visibility on the second quarter and still less visibility on certain factors in the second half. We don\u2019t have significantly greater visibility than we had from our original guidance. And so, that\u2019s one factor, as well as second quarter. As I mentioned, we believe that has some benefit from stimulus, and that begins to moderate in the back half. So, our guidance doesn\u2019t have significant shift from our original guidance on the back half of the year for those reasons. Operator : Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : My first question is on Side Lot and Fusion, and second will be a financial question. So, the first, I know it\u2019s early, and it might even be early -- of early to ask some of these questions on Fusion and Side Lot. I don\u2019t know how many real examples you have yet, but thinking about \u201822 and beyond. Any read that you can provide and how much more productive, even some of the handful of stores that you have are, how they performed, if any better, in the first quarter than the stores that haven\u2019t been touched at all? Hal Lawton : Hey Simeon, good morning. This is Hal, and thanks for your question. I\u2019d start by just saying we are -- the Life Out Here strategy is off to an excellent start. We are -- across all of the initiatives that we have, they\u2019re all underway and getting excellent traction. As we highlighted, the two Neighbor\u2019s Club relaunched a month ago, off to an excellent start there. The FAST team, multiple months of maturation there, having a big impact. Fusion and Side Lot are early days, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we have implemented them in a large number of stores already. They\u2019ve had good customer reactions early on. And the sales performance is as we expected. And in our Q2 call and beyond, you can expect to hear more on performance of those from us as we get through the all-important spring time, and we\u2019re able to fully evaluate the results. Simeon Gutman : And then, the follow-up financial is on second quarter gross margins. Assuming the environment in terms of lack of markdown continues, that should still be a good source year-over-year. But Kurt, you mentioned the pressure that you expect. Is there any way you can quantify, relative -- or direction in terms of freight expense and some of the other headwinds just so we can gauge order of magnitude? Kurt Barton : Yes. Simeon, to address gross margin, I\u2019d first point to a great basis point to look at is referring back to the drivers of Q2 last year that we\u2019re comping and then even reflecting on the Q1 drivers, and that\u2019s really a great way to reconcile to it. And the reason I\u2019d point that out is, last year, some of the drivers in Q2 that we\u2019re about to lap were with the pandemic, you saw transportation costs and certain commodity prices actually declining. And so, that was really a favorable item in there. We are now lapping that first quarter where there was really no promotional or clearance activity. In Q1, the factors that were drivers that we pointed out in Q1, such as the favorable product mix is the last quarter where before we start lapping some of that favorable product mix where the discretionary higher-margin items were a big portion of the mix. So, to give you the level of quantifying of it coming off of that basis, I\u2019d give you the four key factors, and I\u2019ll put it in the order of magnitude. Lapping those lower transportation costs with higher transportation costs right now would be the first. Lapping a favorable product mix in Q2 last year, where the discretionary higher-margin items were a much higher percent than Q would be second. The inflation impact and then followed by, as I mentioned, the onetime Neighbor\u2019s Club impact for launching the points and rewards-based program is a great way of summarizing it. Operator : Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : I have a follow-up on the new customer cohort. My question simply, can you guys quantify the comp impact that you\u2019ve been receiving from new and existing customers, whether it\u2019s this past quarter or the last couple? Kurt Barton : Yes. Scot, this is Kurt. We started the pandemic seeing a strong growth in new customers, and we\u2019ve talked about that over the last three quarters. We continue to see a meaningful portion of our growth coming from new customers. And for the first quarter, when looking at the strength of our business, the new customers, both new customers that entered transacting with Tractor Supply in 2020 as well as new in first quarter really represent a key portion of the first quarter results in the high-single-digit range of our mix of the 38.6% comp. Scot Ciccarelli : That\u2019s fantastic. And just wanted to clarify one other comment that you made earlier, Kurt. So, basically, you guys had much better than -- much better than expected results on 1Q. You\u2019re raising 2Q. You haven\u2019t changed back half from what your original anticipation was. Is that the right way to read it? Kurt Barton : Scot, there\u2019s no real significant change in top line or other factors on the second half. We have certainly considered and recognized some key factors that we pointed out, such as inflation and some of the cost of doing the business. So, we\u2019ve factored that into our overall guidance, but no real meaningful shift in tailwinds or headwinds in our second half algorithm. Operator : Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kate McShane : I wondered if I could switch gears a little bit and just ask about your digital business. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about how customers are using your same-day fulfillment, the BOPIS. I know there\u2019s been a lot that\u2019s been turned on and changed during the pandemic to make it easier to fulfill. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any way to break down how the customer is getting their orders now from digital, and where do you see this going longer term. And then finally, in the same context, are you working towards pushing customers towards the same-day fulfillment and BOPIS options and away from two-day shipping? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Kate. And good morning and thanks for your questions. We are very pleased with the performance of our online business. As we noted in our press release and in our prepared remarks, our fourth quarter now of over 100% growth in the business and its penetration rates continue to increase as an overall percent of our sales. Buy online pickup in store continues to remain approximately 75% of our digital sales, and with curbside pickup, still being about 75% of that buy online pickup in store. So, that\u2019s -- so the customer behavior, even with the growth, continues to kind of stay similar to what it has been in the past. But, what we are seeing is just a much more -- our execution, both from the customer order, all the way through to customer pickup, is just much more efficient than it was this time last year. And that\u2019s really due to all the investments that we\u2019ve made and just the outstanding execution by the team. And I\u2019ll give a brief example of that. We rolled out our first mobile app last year in the summertime. We now have over 1 million downloads of that app, and it\u2019s becoming a material portion of our digital sales. As the customer does a buy online pickup in store order in our app, they can note the type of vehicle they\u2019re driving, the model, the color and then any special pickup requirements they have, like maybe opening up the back of an SUV and putting it in there without even engaging with a customer. Then, as soon as the order is placed, we have Theatro headsets in our stores for every single team member. That tasks within moments, after the order is placed, to sit down to that store, the team member acknowledges. And well over 90% of our orders are now being picked in less than an hour. As soon as the order is completed by the team member, they then check it in with our mobile handheld, which we doubled the capacity of those in our stores last year, and then they take the order up to BOPIS lockers, which we just rolled out in November of last year. The average store has three. And then the customer gets a notification saying it\u2019s ready. On their way into our store, we have an On My Way functionality that customer can hit that. As soon as the customer enters our parking lot, the team member gets a notification saying they\u2019re ready for the order to be picked up. And then, in their Theatro headset, it will actually tell them, Kurt Barton, in a white Ford F-150 is ready for their order, and they\u2019ll walk right out, and they will drop the order in the back of the SUV, as it was indicated. We\u2019re doing well over 90% of that in minutes now. And then, they take the handheld device out there, complete the order because we\u2019ve rolled out additional Wi-Fi access points on the front and the customer drives off. And that is a big percentage of our orders, the customer scenario I just articulated. And the vast majority of the technology as well as the operational components of that are all new from last year. And so, just real kudos to the team for really just implementing a large number of technologies last year as well as operational procedures. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Benedict : Hal, I was wondering, I want to circle back to the rural revitalization theme you were talking about. And just curious if you had any more data around that. Have you guys learned more about maybe what the populations are doing in your markets? Any data that kind of speak to that? I understand you talked more generally about it, but is there anything else you can share? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Peter. I\u2019d say, our data sets that we\u2019re looking at as it relates to kind of the urban departure into rural and suburban is really a combination of our own data, plus what we\u2019re pulling in from external data sources. And if you look at the millennial population in general, this is one that for over almost 10, 15 years now, I think all of us have been wondering if that generation will eventually conform to normal generational activities like house-holding and buying homes and such. And I do think that the pandemic really shocked that generation, and you\u2019re pulling forward now three or four years of those sorts of activities into a year. If you look at home purchases, if you look at household formations, that generation is spiking above all the other generations in those activities. And the urban home purchases that generation are declining, but rural and suburban are increasing. And we see that in our data set as well as we talked about the millennial cohort increasing by 4 percentage points as a percent of our business in the first quarter. And we\u2019re seeing it in our stores in the products that they\u2019re buying and in the way they\u2019re engaging. I think we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we sold 11 million birds last year, and half of those birds went to new customers. And it just shows you a category like poultry, which we\u2019re far and away the market share leader in and it\u2019s a category that really had a renaissance -- went through a renaissance last year and it\u2019s continuing this year in our stores. And you see a lot of new customers coming in buying coops, buying birds, and buying everything that goes along necessary for that passion. And then, they\u2019re taking it out to their new homes in the suburban and rural areas and enjoying the Out Here lifestyle. Peter Benedict : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just on the competitive environment, we know you guys are joining up now with Orscheln. But just how are you seeing your traditional competitors beyond Orscheln kind of act and behave here and then the nontraditional competitors, anytime there\u2019s a market that gets -- seeing great growth, it will attract interest of others. So just curious what you\u2019re seeing, anything interesting evolving on the competitive front as you move here into the spring? Hal Lawton : Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve been really, really focused on our customer over the last 12 or 15 months and with -- are trying to make sure that the competitive -- we stay out ahead of them, and we\u2019re creating a compelling kind of competitive advantage, whether that\u2019s in inventory, and really pleased, as Kurt said, we\u2019d like to have more inventory, but to finish the first quarter, 2 percentage points above last year, given our comp rates. We were relatively pleased there. We have 10,000 more team members than we had this time last year. That\u2019s really indicative of our focus on customer service. And then, if you think about the digital enhancements we made, that\u2019s really about staying ahead of the customer as well. And then, also the investment we\u2019ve made in our brand over the last year. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out the 17-point increase in our unaided brand awareness, moving from 34 points unaided brand awareness to 51 points of unaided brand awareness over the last 15 months. And I think all that kind of comes together to create a really compelling reason to shop Tractor Supply. And we\u2019re certainly seeing the footsteps in our stores and on our website and just staying focused on the customer. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Steven Forbes : I also wanted to sort of focus on customer trends, maybe more broadly. So, Hal, you mentioned 20 million or over 20 million members to date. But, can you remind us how many members transacted during 2020? And then, speak to sort of the differences in behavioral trends, right, maybe just spending trends or trip trends between those 20 million members, right, in the nonmember customer base? Hal Lawton : Sorry. Could you repeat that second part of the question. It muffled on. I apologize. Steven Forbes : Sorry, Hal. Just curious if you could sort of speak to the spending trends, how they differ, right, between the members -- the Neighbor\u2019s Club members customer base over 20 million members and those customers that you have that transact with you who aren\u2019t part of the loyalty member program? Just trying to better gauge, right, what the potential tailwind could be as the new loyalty member program matures here? Hal Lawton : Yes. So, I\u2019d start by first saying our Neighbor\u2019s Club members represent over 60% of our sales. And they shop us much more frequently than our non-Neighbor\u2019s Club members do. And we are seeing equivalent growth in our Neighbor\u2019s Club sales as we are in our non-Neighbor\u2019s Club sales. So, they continue to be very active, very vibrant group. And we\u2019re really excited about the rollout of our new loyalty program because what it does is creates three tiers and rewards our customers based -- the more they spend and the more they earn. And we\u2019re excited about lifting our -- their purchase rates from one tier to the next and kind of driving that upward migration. But they are -- it\u2019s a really strong customer group for us, and we\u2019re really pleased with the results we\u2019ve had in the last year and excited about the ongoing developments in the program. Steven Forbes : Yes. And maybe just a follow-up or to ask that a different way. So, over 20 million customers represent 60% of spend, how many customers account for the remaining 40%? Mary Winn Pilkington : Yes. Steven, it\u2019s Mary Winn. We haven\u2019t given out some of that level of detail, so. But they\u2019re a highly engaged group in Neighbor\u2019s Club. Retention rates are spectacular on it as well. And just\u2026 Hal Lawton : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Your line is open. Elizabeth Suzuki : You had mentioned that inventory, in general, is a little lighter than you\u2019d like. Are there particular categories that are experiencing more acute shortages due to shipping delays or supply constraints? And could there be some pent-up demand or sales that were left on the table due to those inventory constraints? Seth Estep : Hey Elizabeth, this is Seth. Thanks for the question. Yes. As Kurt mentioned there, we really had strong momentum coming out of Q1 and exiting Q1. And while we would love more inventory, obviously, as we said there to continue, obviously to drive sales. So, we feel very good about our position to continue to drive these sales here in Q2. And I\u2019d really bucket the inventory position that we think about really in kind of three primary buckets. The first bucket would be kind of our CUE based product. The team has done an absolutely excellent job making sure that we can continue to stay in stock and be that dependable supplier. And we feel that we can definitely continue to make sure that we can take care of that shopper and customer that\u2019s coming in. Big ticket is really the second primary bucket, and that\u2019s where we really saw that strong demand exiting Q1. And so, I would say early in Q2, that\u2019s where we\u2019re really focused on here, replanning that product that we could bring that in to make sure that we could continue that momentum. And that product\u2019s flowing and have been flowing into stores. And then, third is more on our import side. And the import side is where we did see a little bit more delays as it relates to our inventory position. Most of that is in, call it, our drive aisle type of category. So, if you go in our stores, some of the d\u00e9cor, some of the discretionary type areas, those items have been flowing in nicely. Actually, it\u2019s really putting us in a great position as we\u2019re entering here in the peak of Q2 to make sure our center courts are going to be locked and loaded and full and ready to drive sales. And then, we also talked about the quality of inventories better than it\u2019s ever been. I mean, our clearance position is in an incredibly good spot. So, as you think about that 2% comp inventory, it\u2019s also due to healthy quality inventory to drive future sales. So, feel really good about where we are to continue to drive that momentum here in Q2. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. And just one quick follow-up. I mean, if there are instances where your suppliers are starting to raise prices to you, are you generally able to pass-through those cost increases without much pushback from the customer? Seth Estep : Elizabeth, yes, I mean, we obviously have very robust pricing tool that\u2019s there. Most of our pricing inflation that we\u2019ve seen have been coming from both the grain and steel markets, if you look at what the charts are showing out there. Grain markets have been moderately rising throughout the course of the back half of last year. It\u2019s been pretty steady above, call it, the $5 mark early point this year. We\u2019ve got a very talented team that\u2019s been managing this kind of inflationary environment in the past. And feel very confident in our ability to manage appropriately to make sure we drive market share, but also be able to pass along to drive a level of margin improvement that\u2019s needed as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : So, my first one is kind of a two-part question regarding the Side Lot. And I guess, going to go back to what Simeon was talking about, I guess, if you guys had more availability to do it, would you speed up, if you could? Hal Lawton : Hey Scott. Yes. So first off, on the Side Lot, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve learned a lot over the last six months on the rollout of that program and are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. The team has done just an excellent job navigating through permitting, navigating through kind of COVID and construction crews, also navigating kind of access to steel fixtures and all those sorts of things that are kind of creating a very difficult operating environment. And we\u2019ve done a lot of staffing and hiring of project managers, et cetera, and really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. The team is working full out on the rollout of them this year. We\u2019re confident and kind of reaffirmed our guidance on $150 million to $200 million by the end of this year. And we\u2019ll update you on our plans for 2022 and beyond as we get further into the year. But we still feel very good about 1,500 plus of our stores being applicable to both Fusion and Side Lot, and remain focused on that goal and executing those initiatives as quickly as possible, but also with outstanding precision of execution as well. Scott Mushkin : Okay. So, you would speed up or you wouldn\u2019t? I just was\u2026 Hal Lawton : Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019re running at the right pace right now would be the thing. And if we can speed up as we get further into it, we will. But, I think we\u2019re running at the right pace, right now. There\u2019s -- we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re certainly not constraining ourselves kind of from a kind of capital investment perspective or resourcing perspective. I think, we\u2019re running at the rate that is appropriate for kind of our company right now. Scott Mushkin : Okay. And then, my follow-up question, and basically, I wonder if you guys had the data of new customers buying pet that are also Neighbor\u2019s Club members? Mary Winn Pilkington : That\u2019s cutting the data, Scott. I mean, we have all that data -- for insights, and we use it for all of our digital communications in those areas. Hal Lawton : Yes. Scott, I\u2019d say\u2026 Scott Mushkin : You guys have the ability to cut it that way, though, or do you\u2026 Hal Lawton : I\u2019d start by saying, first, a couple -- I\u2019ll give a couple of data points on that, Scott. So, around a third of our new customers join the Neighbor\u2019s Club. And so, we are seeing good movement of those new customers into the Neighbor\u2019s Club program. And the two biggest drivers of new customers into our stores are pet and feed. And that kind of -- to my comments earlier around core farm and ranch customer and kind of the millennial customer, you kind of -- the trends are kind of applicable. The core farm and ranch customers coming in and buying feed, the millennial customers coming in and buying pet food or chicken feed to kind of fuel those passions and that habit -- those habits. And then, of those new customers, about a third are converting to our Neighbor\u2019s Club as they shop with us. And then, obviously, we would look for that to -- that pace to pick up over time. But, feel really good about our customer trends, and about pet as an attraction for those customer trends but also poultry and feed and then the conversion of those new customers into our loyal Neighbor\u2019s Club members. Operator : Your next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Zack Fadem : You mentioned vendor funding and FAST team benefits of 40 basis points to gross margin in Q1. And as we continue to step up the FAST spend on the SG&A side, do you expect these vendor benefits to build through the year? And could these benefits be high enough to offset some of the headwinds from lower promo, freight and the mix that you\u2019ve called out in the back half? Kurt Barton : Yes. Zach, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll let Seth respond to the last part of your question in there. So, our vendors have certainly been strong supporters of us to be able to fund the cost of the FAST program as we proceed with that. And that\u2019s really our commitment. This team is there to help merchandise and help ensure the sale of that product. And it has been a strong contributor. One of the areas that has been an early win in the Life Out Here strategy. And so, our vendor funding that we anticipated that funding has really began and started to flow through the P&L, pretty consistent about 40 basis points quarter -- throughout all four quarters of the year on the gross margin side. The only thing I\u2019ll remind you is that we said in the back half of last year that we would begin to make the investments in the SG&A to build that team, and that cost actually went through the P&L unfunded. And so, the SG&A cost today for FAST is larger than the funding. And as we begin to build this program, it will eventually neutralize over the years. But for this year, there will be starting to lap in the third and fourth quarters some costs on there. But again, for the year, it will average out about 40 basis points of incremental in SG&A, with 40 basis points of benefit on vendor funding. It will differ between the quarters a bit. And then, I know Seth can go ahead and talk about the investment. Seth Estep : Hey Zach. Just a couple of other points there I\u2019d just roll out. As Kurt mentioned, just one of the big early wins with our Life Out Here strategy. And I\u2019d just say, the timing of the FAST program could not have been better to roll this out with the record volumes that are going through our stores today. Execution has been absolutely excellent among the store teams. Our planogram resets right now are on time, in full, north of 95%, which is a major -- it\u2019s a really good improvement from the past. And it\u2019s allowing our store teams really to focus on the cleanliness as well as to take care of our customers, which has also been a great win for our supplier partners as well. I mean, they\u2019re there to sell products, take care of them and offer that customer service. And then, finally, from a merchant perspective, we plan to have record number of planogram resets occurring throughout the course of this year. And we were able to uptick that last year. And as we\u2019ve been able to operate, and we have been operating in this record sales volume windows, our merchants in the past, we did not have a great avenue at times to go after opportunistic buys, things of that nature to really be able to fill in our drive aisles. And we\u2019ve been able to leverage the FAST team as well as our supplier partners to go after those kind of opportunistic buys, so that we can really maximize the sales trends that are out there. So, I would just say, overall, I\u2019m just incredibly pleased by the FAST program and just really big high marks to the team that\u2019s out there for standing this up and taking care of our supplier base. Zack Fadem : Okay, perfect. And on the loyalty program updates this month, I know it\u2019s early, but any feedback or customer response to reports, thus far? And then, also just quickly on gross margin. You mentioned a slight Q2 headwind to accrue for the elevated benefits or discounts. Is this just a one quarter phenomenon, or a headwind that should persist through the year? Hal Lawton : Yes. So, the Neighbor\u2019s Club program is off to a -- the relaunch is off to an excellent start. At this point, the customer comments are more anecdotal in nature in terms of their positive orientation around the tiers and the excitement about some of the special perks that come along with an around free same day, next-day delivery for a top-tier as well as access to trailer rentals and such. And then, I\u2019d say, we just had our first drop of points going to customers earlier this week. And so, we\u2019re just starting to see some of those redemptions and such. And we\u2019ll be able to talk a bit more about migration of customers over the next couple of quarters. And then, the gross margin impact and modest sales impact that Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, is really more of a Q2 phenomenon that abates as we get further into the year. Mary Winn Pilkington : Given that we\u2019re past the top of the hour, let\u2019s go wrap up our call today. So, Denise, thank you for being our operator today. And this will conclude our call. And thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter call in July. So, thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Our thanks go out to the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their ongoing commitment to each other, our customers in the Out Here lifestyle. The team has been through a lot together over the last 15 months as an essential needs-based retailer, including necessary but cumbersome health and safety measures, surging volumes, the roll out of our Life Out Here strategy, supply chain disruptions, numerous digital investments, and more. The team has risen to each challenge to be there as the dependable supplier to our customers and the communities we call home. Thank you to the team for another great quarter. I would also like to say thank you to our vendor and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome the challenges in the global supply chain network. Together, we were able to support our customers as the dependable supplier for their Out Here lifestyle. Over the first 12 months of the pandemic, through the first quarter of 2021, our sales grew approximately 35%, or $3 billion. In the second quarter of 2021, as we are now comping the comp, we are pleased this momentum and all of the underlying trends have remained and continue to sustain. Looking at the second quarter. The Tractor Supply team delivered a very strong performance that exceeded our expectations as we achieved a 10.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter and a 41% two-year stack. Our results prove yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. Our Life Out Here strategy is still in the early days. We are seeing positive trends from our initiatives. We are excited by the momentum. We remain committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Just last month, we increased pay for nearly 27,000 of our tenured hourly store team members and also raised our minimum wage to $11.25 per hour. Our team members continue to make Tractor Supply a special place that it is. Investing in our team members is not only the right thing to do, it is also a way to recognize their role in driving our business forward. Now, turning to our results for the second quarter of 2021. Our net sales grew approximately 13.4%. Comparable store sales grew 10.5%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 6% and transaction count increase of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.19. Importantly, the underlying foundation of our business is robust. For the quarter, every week had positive comps. Our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. We continue to gain share across all categories, online and in stores. For instance, in Q2, we experienced comparable store growth in our consumable, usable, and edible categories that was well above our overall comparable store sales. E-commerce recorded its largest-ever quarter of sales. The work we have done over the last year to improve our e-commerce capabilities have certainly resonated with our customers. And just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 1.6 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. Given our strong performance year-to-date, coupled with our outlook for the balance of the year, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Kurt will share more details on our revised outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home that we announced in February, we are working cooperatively with the FTC on their second request. We look forward to the benefit this transaction will offer customers with improved product and competitive pricing. We have previously shared key observations of our customer behaviors based on our market data and research, and I would like to update you on that today. Overall, our customer metrics remain very healthy, with both traffic and spending increasing at a balanced rate. So let's run through some of the insights that are most relevant. First, we are seeing broad, continued strength across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping Tractor Supply and these customers are making more trips than ever and are spending more money per trip than ever. We are seeing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. Our retention rates continue to run above historical trends. The conversion of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to a points-based rewards is resonating with our customers. Year-over-year, we've added nearly 5 million new members to the program. In our Neighbor's Club members, they are spending about 3 times the rate of non-members and they are comping at a rate well above the chain average. Neighbor's Club members accounted for about 65% of our sales and that's a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program. We've grown our high-value customer base in the program by about 15% year-to-date, with customers migrating upward in spending, significantly outpacing any downward spending. The retention rate of our most valuable customers is running north of 95%. New customers are joining the Neighbor's Club program at a rate of nearly 30%, significantly above the rate from last year. And the new customers we are acquiring as compared to our core customers are continuing to skew younger. We're seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Our trends this quarter for the customer age cohorts of 18 years to 45 years old were in line with the first quarter. We continue to believe that the growth in this customer segment has staying power. Much like last quarter, the types of trends we're seeing can simply be described as once in a generation. We believe key aspects to our customer service such as a convenient place to shop, product assortment, legendary customer service, and in-stock levels are important to keeping these existing and new customers engaged with our brand. On the macro front, the economy remained strong and key trends continue to work in our favor, such as rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry, and pet adoption. While the cost environment remains elevated across import, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages, the merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. We are closely monitoring the price elasticity to ensure that we are focused on product unit trends. The team is doing an excellent job navigating this environment. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. As the country opens back up, the Out Here lifestyle remains incredibly relevant. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give insight on our Life Out Here strategy and other drivers of the second half of 2021. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today. As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I would like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full year. We are very pleased with our performance. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. For the quarterly cadence, April and June were the strongest months of the comp store sales performance. All geographic regions and all major merchandising categories had comp store sales growth. We believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. A great example of this is the strength in our consumable, usable, and edible products. Our C.U.E. products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. For the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, C.U.E. had comp store sales growth above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed, and dry dog food were among the strongest categories with comp sales all greater than 25%. Of note, we are seeing strong retention rates of our new customers across every species of livestock and companion animal. For example, poultry, a hallmark homesteading category for Tractor Supply has the highest retention rate of the animal species for new customers and new to the category. Our big ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have strong comp sales performance above the chain average. This was driven by strength in zero-turn mowers, safes, utility vehicles and trailers. Lastly, inflation contributed about 350 basis point to 400 basis point to comparable store sales in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 35.8%, a decrease of 67 basis points. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally three items. First, higher freight cost that all of retail is experiencing. Second, an initial impact from the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And third, a more normalized C.U.E. product mix. Our price management program partially offset these factors as we look to mitigate the impact of inflation and other cost pressures. Consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams or FAST initiative, which was launched in the second half last year. Of note, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions as we are committed to being true to our everyday low pricing strategy and continue to see strong demand for our product categories. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 90 basis points above our Q2 2019 rate of 34.9%. Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 6 basis points to 22.3%. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation, as well as good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, additional store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service, and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 40 basis points of incremental SG&A expense with the labor costs for the team. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q2 2019 when our SG&A expense ratio was 22.7%. Operating profit increased 8.5%, with operating profit margin of 13.5% on the quarter. Net income was $370 million, an increase of 9.3%. Diluted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 10%. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.99 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a 14% increase in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021, looking ahead, while the trends in our business provide additional confidence in the structural nature of the tailwind, we remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine roll out can have further impact on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results. There is still some measure of uncertainty we continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes and we will remain nimble and adjust as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong result in the half of the year and the positive momentum we see in our businesses continuing into the second half of 2021. Please note that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. So against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion with comparable store sales growth in the range of 11% to 13%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 9.9% of sales, a step up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.70 to $8. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.05 to $7.40 per diluted share. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. While we continue to lap challenging sales and earnings comps, we expect positive sales comp in both the third and fourth quarter with the third quarter a few points higher than the fourth quarter. Please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance of the prior year where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as favorable product mix where C.U.E. products represented a smaller portion of sales. Much like the results in the second quarter, we are expecting gross margin decline in the back half of the year due to higher transportation costs and continued strength in the C.U.E. products. Our guidance assumes promotional activity comparable to last year in Q3, with Q4 seeing some shift back to normalizing promotions during the holiday season. While we are dealing with significantly higher transportation costs, a mix shift to C.U.E. and cost of goods increases, we continue to see benefit from a pullback in promotions and are seeing less price elasticity from consumers as we adjust prices. We believe we are effectively navigating impacts to our gross margin. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a hallmark of Tractor Supply. We have raised our outlook for capital spending to now be in the range of $500 million to $600 million to reflect higher construction and raw material costs for store projects and increased technology investments for the customer experience. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchase. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. To wrap up, we are very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and see positive momentum carrying into the second half of 2021. We continue to build relevance and market share both today and over time. We are excited about the investments ahead of us to better serve our customers from new stores, Project Fusion remodels and our side lot transformation. We are strengthening our supply chain and growing our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has thrived over the last 15 months. We continue to operate from a position of strength and are committed to investing in the business. Our Life Out Here strategy is designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. We are transforming our stores through our Project Fusion remodel and side lot transformation, optimizing our technology in store and online and investing in how we operate our stores. I am incredibly proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our strategic priorities, especially amid a global pandemic and running the business at an elevated rate. So, let me share with you an update on how a few of our comp initiatives are progressing. I'll start with the field activity support team. The 1,200-plus person organization is designed to improve store labor productivity. Example task of the FAST team include execution of merchandising programs like center court, end-caps, clip strips, planogram resets, seasonal programs and our sales driving initiatives. Rolled out in the third quarter of last year, this team has made great progress in improving execution of our merchandising activity, which represents the second largest body of work for our store team members. Year-to-date, the execution of task by the FAST team is running at 97% or nearly 33 points higher than our base year of 2019. The FAST team is allowing the store teams to spend more time on customer service and improve their in-store execution. We believe the FAST team will continue to contribute to comparable store sales well into the future. Turning next to our Project Fusion store remodel program, recall, our Project Fusion is our state of the art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. We now have more than 160 stores in the new layout and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are taking note of things like the improved shopping experience in our remodel and specifically in our customer intercept surveys, they are calling out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter and easier to navigate factors. While the majority of the remodel have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read of our customer response and the comp lift of the remodel is running in line with our expectations. Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales. Another component of our space productivity program is the transformation of our side lot. Typically, there is as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we had inside the store. The productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We are in the midst of a multi-year project to transform our side lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot spaces leverage to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, enter new categories, and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online, pickup at store capabilities for drive-thru pickup. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. Addition of product categories, increased user shopping, and new services provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged at Tractor Supply and attract new customers to the brand. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our side lot remains a significant opportunity. We currently have about 60 side lot transformations completed and we anticipate having greater than 150 complete as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we are learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for our expanded lawn and garden assortment and we are even more excited than we embarked on the initial test pilot. The team has done a great job laying the foundation of our Life Out Here strategy as we scale our transformational initiatives. Beyond our multi-year strategic initiative, at Tractor Supply, we are always focused on having the seasonally appropriate offerings to support our customers. Wrapping up the summer season, we're exiting the quarter with clean inventory with a seasonal changeover. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings for the transition to the important fall and winter season. Across all areas of the store and online, we have fall-centric merchandising and marketing plans in place to keep our customers engaged. Whether it's the launch of our Pet Appreciation Week in September to the roll out of our Deer Hunting planograms set, or our focus on heating products for the change in temperature, our customers know that they can count on Tractor Supply for the relevant products that they need to live Life Out Here. We are leveraging new items and innovation across grilling, safes, and home and decor. In addition, Ridgecut, our exclusive brand of performance workwear will be expanded across new categories and into women's workwear. These product expansions are relevant to both new and existing customers and will help retain our growing customer base. Across all parts of the store, we have exciting products for the fall and winter as we shift gears to ramp up for our customers' need to care for their land, home, animals and pets as colder weather comes. On the marketing front, we are making continued investments to drive our brand awareness. As part of our plans, we are excited to announce a new multi-year partnership to be the official Life Out Here partner for the Professional Bull Riders effective this season. The partnership includes the flagship presence on the PBR tour that host over 200 events per year, a Tractor Supply branded broadcast boost during the pre-show on CBS and in-arena broadcast activation and local customer activation. PBR will also produce and distribute custom content for our social media channels. We are very excited to support our customers' passion for this dynamic and rapidly growing sport. Again, on marketing, given the strong millennial trends we've been experiencing, we're investing in marketing to continue to attract and nurture this important demographic. Given that the millennial customer cohort may not be as familiar with our brand, we are executing marketing plans to introduce Tractor Supply to this next generation of customers. Just last month, we launched a new campaign targeting millennials' immediate channels like Pandora, YouTube and other streaming services. That campaign is called Welcome to Life Out Here and introduces this new audience to what lies ahead in our stores and the lifestyle we help support. The focus is on key categories such as pet, backyard poultry, gardening and self-reliance. With the primary goal to drive awareness, the millennial campaign has delivered significant impression since the launch. Early results show best in class performance in ad recall and awareness relative to traditional benchmarks. We believe this indicates that we are resonating with this audience and it is driving consideration for Tractor Supply. To summarize, we've delivered strong results year-to-date and made significant progress with our strategic initiatives. We have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply. With our purposeful actions, we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger company. It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good morning. So, Hal, I wanted to focus on the Neighbor's Club relaunch. So, maybe a two-part question here. If we look at the spending tiers, right, that are sort of defined by the program. Curious if you'd provide some context around how these tiers were determined. And any sort of color, right, that you could provide to help us better understand sort of what percentage of members today would qualify, right, for the preferred for plus tiers? Any color would be appreciated there. Hal Lawton : Steve, of our now 21 million-plus Neighbor's Club members. And like kind of all loyalty programs, we try to -- as we created in this case three tiers, we tried to kind of reasonably distribute it with kind of a decreasing proportion across each of the three buckets. And then we also tried to create tier levels that would naturally encourage upward migration and discourage downward migration. I would say a few things. As we talked about on the call, our Neighbor's Club members now account for over 65% of our sales. Our retention rate on our Neighbor's Club members is over 80%, very strong retention rate on an annualized basis. And as we said, our highest -- our third tier of spending, which is the -- the Neighbor's Club Premium Plus, the retention rates there are over 95%. So we're seeing significant upward migration. We're seeing reduced downward migration. And the final thing I'll make a mention of is that our Neighbor's Club members, they make two more trips quarter on average than our non-Neighbor\u2019s Club members. And our Neighbor's Club members had spent over $1,000 a year. We've got almost $2.5 million of those and that's increasing kind of on a daily basis. So, it's a very robust program with its 21-plus million members. We've seen over 5 million members join us in the last 12 months. We're seeing outstanding retention. We're seeing excellent migration. As we migrate them, the retentions are holding and actually improving, and we've seen a significant positive response to the roll out of the new program. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, since the roll out of the program, our Neighbor's Club members are significantly outcomping our overall chain average. Steven Forbes : Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. If I think about the last few quarters, you provided some context around repeating trends. I think a percentage of customers repeating within 12 months, probably on a rolling basis. I think it was 50% last month. You mentioned sort of it's running at a high. So just any context around repeat trends that we think about the growth from the customer base, the experience over the past 18 months. Hal Lawton : Yes. So our customer repeat shopping trends continue to remain very high. New customer retention rates continue to hover in that kind of 50-ish percent similar to last quarter and the previous quarters. And our customer -- our new customer counts were only slightly below our new customer counts from Q2 2020. And so for us, there's a lot of good news on the customer side. We saw 11 million last year. We saw 2.6 million, nearly 3 million in Q1. We're seeing kind of 50%-plus retention rates on those new customers. The way -- kind of an interesting way to think about it is, on the 11 million new customers we saw last year, 6 million have shopped with us again and 3 million of those joined the Neighbor's Club program. And so that's just -- if you think about that walk just some outstanding metrics retention, conversion to the Neighbor's Club program. And then again this quarter, we are seeing new customer counts nearly the same as the second quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Steven. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. My first question is the stabilized period that you outlined at the earnings day, it hasn't really happened yet. I guess it has relative to last year, but the business is still growing. Can you talk about the factors that would argue that the business doesn't need to digest and therefore, continue to grow and then vice versa. What suggests that we are going to have a digestion period and we'll have a deeper stabilization period versus the way you expected it? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Simeon, how are you? I'd start out with -- at the highest level, I'd say, there still continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the United States economy and globally, whether that's on -- certainly as it relates to COVID, the delta variant, the implications that has on mobility and on customer shopping behaviors. I'd say, if you track back to our October enhanced earnings day last year, kind of implied a bit in the graphic Kurt showed with a bit more of a return to normal mentality at some point that was more abrupt in nature. And I'd say, I think as we're all watching how COVID's playing out, that's certainly not the case. And so I'd also say that our business continues to evolve. And if you think back to them, we were talking about 50-50 on structural versus transitory in terms of trends. And I think we'd lean more towards structural now in the way we view our trend. If you think about pet, if you think about the millennial customer, if you think about homesteading, kind of rural revitalization, categories like poultry as an example. So last year, as we've said several times, we sold 11 million birds, half of those were to new customers. We're seeing, as mentioned by Kurt in his prepared remarks, outstanding retention of those customers last year that shopped with us on poultry coming back again this year. In fact, our retention rate is higher than any other animal feed or pet. So, I mean, it just shows you that the trends that began last year are really resonating and resilient and that momentum that we're seeing with our customers and in our business and with the lifestyle -- the Out Here lifestyle that we appeal to is holding incredibly strong. And I think in my prepared remarks I talked about the fact that between Q2 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, we had grown $3 billion and 34% comps. And we were kind of coming into Q2, I think like many companies with certainly us wondering how we would comp the comp and we had guided to kind of flattish at the beginning of the year for that and perhaps even a little down and finished with a plus 10.5%, certainly exceeded our expectations. And it's really all about the underlying trends, the strength in our consumer behavior, new customers and the appeal of that Out Here lifestyle. And I think there is still a lot of uncertainty in the out years and quarters, but I would say we feel more confident in the structural orientation of the trends than we did last October. Simeon Gutman : Thank you for that. In terms of CapEx, I think Kurt had mentioned that it was relatively level in these outyears as it steps up from a couple of years ago. Does it peak in 2021? Do you spend further and accelerate into 2022, how should we think about cadence? Kurt Barton : Simeon, this is Kurt. On the cadence over the next few years, as we pointed out, back in October when we launched our new long-term targets in the Life Out Here strategy, we said that we've got consistency in our investment, in the existing stores as we drive productivity with Fusion and side lot, but that where there may be some variation would be on the supply chain as we grow our supply chain, particularly new distribution centers. And so, as you've heard us in the last couple of quarters emphasize the importance of our investment in our supply chain, we are looking to accelerate and would see us shifting some of the supply chain investments earlier in the next few years. And so there may be higher than average in 2021, 2022, even 2023, but over the period of time, it still averages out about the five-year expectation that we gave. And the important thing is the recognition or our confidence in the structural nature of this business and therefore the importance of our timing of investments in the supply chain. So I see 2021 and 2022 pretty consistent in potential on capital as we emphasize ensuring the strength of our supply chain. Simeon Gutman : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And particularly C.U.E. It's hard to imagine that -- poultry or livestock products are growing as fast as you've been experiencing. But at some point or is this success starting your -- where you are not going to scale they're going to be more promotional, there has been no share losses. So, at what point do you see this risk holding in the next several quarters? Hal Lawton : Hey, Michael, how are you and thanks for joining our call this morning. Yes, I'll start with the fact that we're confident. We're taking share really across every major category that we have in the business, both in stores and online. If you look at the profile between new customers, existing customers, both are showing strong comp, transaction growth, average ticket growth, and as I said in our prepared remarks, more customers are shopping trucks more than ever, they are visiting us more frequently and they are shopping -- they are spending more when they are shopping us. What I would say is, we participate in a very attractive large $110 billion market, where our share kind of based on our new guidance would be barely above 10%. There is a lot of share gain out there and also a lot of share to still be competed with. We're dominantly very focused on our customer and just making sure that the initiatives and the actions that we take are out there to create the best customer experience that we can, whether that's investments in our team members to drive that legendary customer service or investments in inventory to ensure we're in stock for our customers. I would say, as it relates to the promotional environment, we've not -- we've had very little to no promotions in Q1 and Q2 of this year and that's our expectation really for the balance of the year. And I really expect the competitive environment to remain similar for no other reason because of the supply/demand situation that's out there. And the global supply chain is disrupted as I've seen it in my 25 plus years in retail and everyone is working hard to just keep inventory in their stores. And I think that mindset would prevail over any sort of promotional share push that anyone has. I would also just comment that we don't directly compete with really any primary retailer. Being a lifestyle retailer, one of our benefits is that we play across a handful of large categories that are uniquely tailored to our customer, but typically, when we are competing with other companies, it's on a one-off category basis and we really appeal to that whole lifestyle. But I don't anticipate an increase in the promotional environment in the market or certainly for us anywhere near on the near or medium term horizon. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on [indiscernible] accelerate from last quarter. Where do you expect that to go during the next few quarters? Kurt Barton : Yes, Michael, this is Kurt. You stated the results accurate on the last quarter. Let me give quick backdrop and that will lead towards the back half, but we entered the year expecting 100 to 200 basis points of retail inflation throughout the year that quickly produced in Q1 closer to 300 basis points, principally from commodities. And then as we shifted into Q2, at the 350 to 450 basis points of retail benefit from inflation. One, it demonstrates the ability, as Hal mentioned, to be able to adjust pricing appropriately. But the increase in Q2 over Q1 was principally related to transportation costs and other non-commodity type based cost increases. We see in the back half of the year staying at elevated levels. And we would anticipate that the numbers in Q2, it would be at that level and potentially at moderately higher levels throughout the back half. And in this inflation environment, I always like to remind that our merchants in our business, we deal with inflation and deflation every year and they are managing this excellent and we feel we've got the ability right now in the consumer sentiment, the less price elasticity in their behavior to be able to manage the inflation environment very well throughout this year. Michael Lasser : Great, thank you so much. Operator : And your next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Thanks and good morning. My question is on Side Lot. Is it possible now with a few quarters under your belt to give us some update on the sales that you've this spring and any other learnings that you plan to apply to the balance of the stores you are going to open this year in the side lot format? And then as a follow-up, you talked about 60% to 70% of the fleet potentially holding side lot. I'm curious how quickly you think you're going to accomplish all that cycle? Hal Lawton : Yes, hey Chuck, how are you? And thanks for joining the call today. I'd start out with both Fusion and side lot. We are very pleased with the results. And we've made a lot of progress over the last six to nine months on both of these efforts. We've rolled out, as we mentioned, we've got over 160 Fusions done, over 60 side lot transformations done. In addition to the work on those individual stores, we've brought the project management in-house. We're reducing our construction times and lowering costs and we see lots of opportunity to continue to do that as we move forward. Particularly on the side lot, we've iterated on kind of the plans several times and keep optimizing the format every -- as we roll it out. But we are very pleased with the results, with the progress we made in both. On the results, what I'd say is, we typically, I think, kind of historically in retail, it's the same in all my experiences. You start to really get a good feel for how the remodel lift is playing out kind of three to four months after the store kind of reopens and the remodels and complete. Most of our remodels haven't been open that long. So we're really kind of waiting over the next three to six months to start to see how that data set plays out. But what I'd say is, for the stores that have been open kind of over that period of time, they are at the levels that we anticipated in our initial business case. And we have more of those on the Fusion than we do on the side lot. But we're very pleased with the results of both projects. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer excitement around us becoming more of a destination in garden has been more significant than we even anticipated and we are even more bullish on that as we move forward. As it relates to the penetration of the kind of how long, we'll -- I think you can expect to hear us share more of that over time. But I'd say directionally over about a five-year time frame, you should think about kind of the Fusion stores for the most -- the vast majority of our stores having Fusion and on side lot really around that 60% to 70%. I think we're feeling more bullish around getting more of our store base done with Fusion than maybe were even six months ago, just the way that project is going, the cost that we're doing at it. They were doing it for the early read on the lift we're seeing and then the need just to continue to kind of remodel our store base. Chuck Grom : That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up I know this is unrelated I apologize. But given some new over the past few days about this delta variant, I'm curious, if you've seen any choppiness in some of the regions that you operate on vaccinations? Hal Lawton : I'd start with our -- our business has over the last 15, 18 months now has remained incredibly consistent and we've said that on a number of calls, consistent across regions, consistent in category trends, consistent week to week, consistent month to month. As we said, all 13 weeks of this past quarter were positive comps, obviously all three months were positive comps. We exited June with strong momentum and even as we certainly -- as a nation, as we've seen this delta variant pickup, we've not seen any impact on our trends whether at a national level or at a regional level and that's very similar to what we observed last year and I think it's almost -- I hate to say, but I think the lack of mobility sometimes driven by these outbreaks actually plays to the benefit of Tractor Supply. I think it's demonstrated that when folks are spending more time at their homes with their families, their pets, their animals, their land, they buy and Tractor Supply to be kind of that one-stop shop resource for them to continue all those hobbies that they love and they are just spending more time doing those hobbies. And so while we certainly want and wish the country to return to normal as fast as possible, the delta variant, we don't see it as a potential threat. If anything, maybe some upside to it from our business results -- from a business results perspective. Chuck Grom : Thank you, Hal. Good luck. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. If we look at sales trends over the past two quarters and, Hal, could you tie it to the TV advertising you've been doing and did that lead into this relationship with the PDR? Hal Lawton : We want to own Life Out Here and we think we have the credibility to do so and are viewed that way by our customers. And as I mentioned in -- we do an awareness survey of our customers twice a year. In our last earning call, I mentioned our unaided brand awareness in November of 2019 was 37% and then 18 months later, right as we're exiting Q1, it was up to 51%. So we've seen a 14 point -- sorry, a 17 point increase -- 34% to 51%, a 17 increase in our unaided brand awareness. Much of that is obviously our core customer, but a lot of it is off of the millennial customer. And as we mentioned last quarter, we saw a 4 point increase in our millennial customer penetration year-over-year. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that trend continued in Q2. So we think the work we're doing in marketing is broadening the aperture of consumers' understanding of Tractor Supply and driving unaided and aided awareness and kind of driving footsteps into our stores. As we said, we continue to have strong comp transactions across the board and we're really excited about the partnership with PVR. We think it's a category that resonates well with our customer and one with over 200 activities a year that we can do a lot of activation across the areas of the country where our customers are. And it will be a great partnership. As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are also -- we have launched a large marketing campaign targeted towards the millennials. And up until now, the majority of our above-the-line marketing has been TV and kind of Facebook based. And on TV, it's really been around news media. And we think that's been very successful for our core customer. Those are the major places that they engage with media. The millennial customer, as we all know, engages in different types of media. They are on Pandora, Spotify, YouTube. And so what this led us do is actually create a very different creative concept called Welcome to Life Out Here, explaining who Tractor Supply is and then talk about those first two, three hobbies that they might engage in : backyard poultry, backyard gardening, pets, things like that. They are kind of starter categories, if you will, in Life Out Here. We're very excited about that work and the initial feedback from customers is outstanding. And just hats off to the marketing team for all the work they've done to really drive awareness of our business and drive footsteps into our store. Chuck Cerankosky : Thank you, Hal Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi, good morning everyone. I will ask first questions here. The first, Kurt, your second half plan implies some negative incremental margins. I know you talked about some of the investments you are making etcetera. I'm just curious kind of your view on that, how that comes about. Maybe the -- give us an idea of maybe the magnitude of the gross margin decline or visioning relative to 2Q's 65% to 70% decline. And a follow-up would be just about your P&L flexibility as we look longer term in the event that sales to slow or even turn down a bit, what levers do you have to pull in that environment? Thanks so much. Kurt Barton : Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. And two questions, margin second half and then our ability to be nimble and some of the profitability enhancement opportunity. So, on the second half, when we look at the operating margin, here's how we view it and frame it up. Our gross margin in the pandemic was really the source of the beat in the operating margin and we view the second half really about the gross margin performance. We anticipate Q3's gross margin performance where we've got more visibility to Q3 at this point, very much similar in line with the performance of Q2. As we get further into the second half of the year, we've taken a fairly prudent approach. There is more uncertainty beyond one more quarter and we've always given a little bit more certainty on the most recent or the most nearest quarter. For the second half, we've recognized -- or the fourth quarter, we've recognized supply chain disruptions, inflation factors, as well as the holiday season and what level of competitive nature. And so we've certainly reflected some of those uncertainties in the fourth quarter and the operating margin on the back half of the year really rides on our performance with the gross margin. And as I said earlier and second quarter shows, we've really been able to manage in this environment very well. The business is structurally very sound. We have a lot of confidence in our business in our back half and if some of the uncertainties don't play out, we acknowledge there is potentially some upside to the guidance that we've given. In regards to flexibility, we always have strong profit improvement process going on and a few of the factors that we are focused on right now where we've got some ability to be able to adjust would be in the supply chain. The work that we're doing to reduce stem miles and to continue to just lever the size of this organization drive efficiency in there, as well as our ability to be nimble on variable cost. If there is any sort of shift in the momentum of the business, we're able to shift very well in regards to variable costs in both distribution and stores to be able to adjust on that. We've got a solid profit improvement initiative that is driving some of the efficiencies and these are the active offsets that we have going on to be able to help us maintain operating margins well above the 2019 ranges while we're making important investments in the business. Peter Benedict : Right. Thanks so much. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, maybe time for one more call. Operator : All right and your last question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in today. So, Kurt, you suggested in the past that the 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in 2020 was largely related to muted promo, low clearance environment. And now that we're halfway through this year and you've seen the environment more or less continue, can you just talk us through the long-term state of the gross margin line and to what extent the current 35% plus margin is the right way to think about this business or are there reasons to believe that the historical 34% range is more appropriate as promos and clearance inevitably return? Kurt Barton : As we've said throughout this pandemic, to your point, we've seen over 100 basis points of our operating margin improvement over pre-pandemic really coming from gross margin as you mentioned. We've said that we anticipate, over time, as we cycle the pandemic, we expected somewhat normalization on some of those factors, the promo, the clearance. While we do anticipate and are very disciplined in holding to it everyday low pricing and giving our customers the best price we can, our long-term guidance assume some normalization. Now, we acknowledge that if -- with our guidance shows that a second year in 2021, we'll maintain operating margins of above that long-term target range. And so as we go -- as we get further through 2021, we certainly as we manage this business see as things start to normalize, we'll address the long-term expectations on gross margin, but we're going to always continue to offer strong everyday low pricing. We're going to focus on gaining market share and focus on driving unit growth. So price is going to be very important to us in leveraging the strength of the size of our business to have an efficient and nimble supply chain. So as we get more visibility, we will certainly acknowledge the gross margin, operating margin trends compared to our long-term target. For right now, we're not reaching beyond the visibility in certainly the next couple quarters. Zach Fadem : And a quick follow-up on that. I mean, in 2019, you had $10 billion sales day. Last year that stepped up to $10.5 billion and this year it's going to step up more to $12 billion. Could you guys talk about the scale advantages you generated and how that should translate at the gross margin and operating expense lines? Hal Lawton : Hey, Zack, it's Hal. And again thanks for joining the call today and I'd say a few things. First off, on the scale advantage, it'd say it dominantly gives us an opportunity in the market. With our 8 distribution centers, moving towards 11, the relationships that we have with our vendors and the meaningfulness of that, with the technology investments we're able to make. As an example every single one of our team members wears a Theater headset that really creates an optimal customer service experience in the stores. We're in the process of rolling out new handheld devices for every team member inside the stores as well. Those sorts of investments are enabled by our scale and they are enabled -- and they are really focused on helping us create, gain and capture market share and drive top line sales. And as we've talked many times, our main goal is to grow at a rate faster than the market. That's what's implied in our long-term operating trends and that's how our business is performing now. And then on the operating profit rate, as you said, we've been able to - our outlook is to hold SG&A flat or down and we've been - we've done that over the last six quarters and anticipate continuing to do so. So as we've grown our sales and grown our sales base, we've been reinvesting in the business, but doing at a point where we're not deleveraging there and it's - whether it's in the capital line or in our team member line, and we view our team members as a strategic asset. We are a customer service driven retailer. We are not a retailer where you're going to walk in, pick the item you want, go to a self-checkout and never talk to someone, loading your car yourself and drive away. We are going to help you pick the item, we're going to review, we're going to check you out and we're going to help you loaded in your car. And that that's going to drive sustainable share gain for us. And then on the gross margin rate side, I think we continue to be very pleased that the promotional environment remains very little to none and our inventory position where it is, we are just requiring little to no clearance activity as well. Our hope is that the longer that sustains itself, the more structural that becomes. Right now, we are in a high-cost freight and import environment. That's reflected in our guidance. And we're very pleased with the low promotional nature. It's allowing us to offset those freight and import to allow us to give the guidance that we've given right now. And fully acknowledge, as Kurt said that if sales remain at the rates that they are in Q2 that there would be upside to the guidance that we've given, but we just thought it was prudent at this point to kind of provide the guidance that we had just given the continued level of uncertainty out there. Zach Fadem : Makes sense. Appreciate the context. Mary Winn Pilkington : Great. Thank you everyone. Dan, that will wrap up our call today. So thank you for joining us. Marianne and I will be around for any questions and will look forward to speaking to you at our call in October. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference all.

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn. And thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. The Tractor Supply Team delivered strong results for the third quarter with net sales of 15.8%. Comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%. Team is doing an outstanding job navigating a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. We continue to benefit for many market trends that we see as very structurally sound. We have strengthened our customer base. We're gaining market share across our categories. We continue to advance our Life Out Here Strategy. Our business has never been stronger. And we see tremendous opportunities for growth ahead of us. As we've consistently shared with you over the last 18 months, our strong results are a testament to our 45,000+ team members and I'd like to thank them for all their efforts in the quarter. They kept each other safe as we went through another COVID-19 wave, and navigated through broad based supply chain disruptions, cost of goods increases, and navigated and manage through a tight labor market. Through it all, they've been resilient and persevere to deliver strong customer satisfaction scores, including all-time high [Indiscernible] scores. Our team members are our greatest strategic asset, and a key competitive differentiator with our customers.. Our loyal and highly engaged team members have helped us fare better than most as far as staffing across our stores and [Indiscernible]. Back in June, we raised our minimum opening wage to $11.25 per hour. Our recent wage actions bring our average hourly wage rate at our stores to nearly $15 per hour as we exit the year, with our DC at a higher rate. The investments we have made in store labor are being recognized by our customers, by the overall customer satisfaction scores that I just mentioned. I'd also like to say thank you to our vendors and supply chain partners, as we've worked together to overcome challenges in the global supply chain network and together we've been very focused on controlling what we can control to deliver these results. Across our network, we've been nimble and been able to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures, and the team has done a great job addressing issues ranging from import container shortages in port delays, driver shortages, higher freight rates, and a multitude of other supply chain constraints. To mitigate these challenges, the team has leveraged dedicated container ship, pop-up [Indiscernible], expansion of mixing centers and direct-to-store shipment. Despite these challenges, our inventory is in good shape and our in-stock rates finished above last year at the end of the quarter. Our diversified vendor base with only about 12% direct import is a strong point of differentiation for us during these supply chain times. Given our scale and sophistication, we believe that our network is a competitive advantage to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. Categories in which we participate, in the Out Here Lifestyle that we serve continue to have elevated consumer spending levels well above pre -COVID levels. We fully anticipate this environment we're in is going to continue for the foreseeable future. And consequently, we think that the sales growth that we've seen is structurally sound, given the changes in consumer behavior and the lifestyle investments that are now much more ingrained in the consumer psyche. Key structural trends that continue to work in our favor include things like rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omni -channel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and investments in hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry, and of course, pet ownership. For many workers, the return to office has been pushed out until next year. And even then, we'll very likely be in a hybrid environment at most employers. And at this point, our customers will have been great for over two years as [Indiscernible] we anticipate that their behaviors are much more sustainable and structural. Provide some color on our results. Let me share a few other highlights of the third quarter. Like the second quarter, every week had positive comps. Also, like the second quarter, our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. Our e-commerce business continues to experience strong momentum with double-digit sales increases of over 40%, and in just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 2 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. We continue to gain share across all categories. This has been a consistent trend for multiple quarters now. And the share gain has been both online and in stores. The share gain has been aided by the increase in our unaided brand awareness, which has improved by 21% points since November of 2019. This improvement combined with positive trends in our overall customer satisfaction, are a significant contributor to the share gains we're experiencing. Also consistent from previous quarters, all customer segments were strong, with notable strength in our Core Farm and Ranch, which is the largest and most important of our customer base. At the same time, our digital ad campaign to target millennials supporting a significant growth we're seeing in this important demographic. We think the relevancy of Tractor Supply to millennial customers have staying power given the structural changes in the market and our customer behaviors and we're certainly seeing that consistently quarter-after-quarter in our data as our average age of customer trend down. For the year, more customers than ever have shopped at Tractor Supply. These customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip and our new customer retention remains very strong. Our Neighbors Club loyalty program continues to exceed our expectations with year-over-year sales growth of these members north of 20% We exited the quarter with more than 22 million Neighbors Club members. These members are spending more than -- about 3 times the rate of non-members, with Neighbors Club members now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. This continues to be a step-up from where we've been running prior to the re-launch of the program and sequential improvement over the second quarter of this year. The number of high-value per customers in the program grew almost 30% for the quarter and we continue to experience retention rate in excess of 95% for our high-value customers. These strong results demonstrate the changes to Neighbors Club continue to gain traction with our customers. Given our robust performance through the third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again raising our sales and earnings guidance for 2021. And Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, we continue to work cooperatively with the FTC as it continues to review the proposed transaction. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved product offering and competitive pricing. As has been the case over the last 18 months, I'm incredibly proud of the way our entire Tractor Supply team has managed to stay focused on taking care of each other and our customers. Our long-term opportunities remain very exciting. Our goal has been to emerge from the pandemic stronger. Over the course of the last year since rolling out our Life Out Here Strategy, we have gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we believe that we're going to emerge from it even stronger and better positioned as we execute our strategy. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. As Hal shared, we continue to believe the underlying health of our business is very strong. Third quarter comp store sales of 13.1% representing 39.9% 2-year stack were driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 9.5% and transaction count increase of 3.6% An example of the structural advantage we have is the ongoing strength in our consumable, usable, and edible products. Our C.U.E. products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. Once again, C.U.E. outperformed the chain average comp sales and for the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, C.U.E. had comp sales growth at or above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed, and dry dog food were among the strongest categories, with broad-based strength. Our big ticket categories, which we're going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have solid comp store sales performance in line with the chain average. This was driven by strength in trailers, recreational and utility vehicles, safes, and zero-turn mowers. Inflation contributed about 700 basis points to comparable store sales. As you've heard from the retail sector and others, the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages. Our merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. our merchant and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well. As we closely monitor our customers purchasing behaviors, we're focused on product unit trends and are committed to being priced right every day. Our third quarter gross margin rate was 36%, a decrease of 41 basis points versus last year. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about a 100 basis points above our Q3 2019 rate of 35%. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally three items. First higher product cost inflation, second, elevated freight costs inclusive of domestic and import costs and third, a more normalized product mix shift in C.U.E. All of retail is working through the drivers of inflation and freight costs. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our price management program. Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. The benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams for our fast initiative, which was launched in the second half of last year, was consistent with our guidance. Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio including depreciation and amortization, improved by 58 basis points versus last year to 26.1%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage and occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service, and investments in our Life Out Here Strategy initiative. Given the elevated volumes and current operating environment, we also encourage select discrete costs such as incremental team member benefits, pop-up DCs, and the timing of our annual sales meeting, which normally occurs in the first quarter. The offset to our fast initiative benefit in gross margin was approximately 20 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor costs for the team as we are now cycling the initial investment to launch the program last year. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q3 2019. We've had about 70 basis points favorable expense ratio since then. Operating profit increased about 18% with operating profit margin of nearly 10% in the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% from the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion, representing an 11.7% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Moving now to our updated guidance for Fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. Despite this uncertainty, including product cost inflation, and supply chain constraints, we are raising our full-year outlook. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive and structural momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we're forecasting Fiscal 2021 net sales centered around $12.6 billion with comparable store sales growth of about 16%. For the year we forecast an operating margin of 10.2% to 10.3%, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $8.40 to $8.50. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.70 to $8 per diluted share. Within this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 8% to 10%. Two modeling points to keep in mind, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance and as you start to roll forward your models for 2022, please keep in mind that next year, we'll have 53rd week for us. This week is typically a low volume week of sales, given that it follows the Christmas holidays. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. And with that, we are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide a legendary customer experience across all channels. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. In summary, our results proved yet again, Tractor Supply 's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the out here lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a Company. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Now, I'd like to share with you an update on our recent ESG announcement, as well as provide updates on our Fusion and Side Lot strategic initiatives which are key parts of our Life Out Here Strategy. At the time of urgency and action on climate change in social justice, we just announced new goals that are the next step in our long-standing commitment to sustainability, stewardship, and opportunity. By 2040, we're committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all our operations. As part of our social commitments, we are prioritizing and accelerating our initiatives and actions for diversity, equity, and inclusion. At Tractor Supply, we are focused on cultivating an environment of inclusion where diversity of all kinds is appreciated in value. I invite you to learn more on our dedicated ESG website. Turning next to our Life Out Here Strategy. As a reminder, we've been executing against five key strategic initiatives this year as part of our overall strategy. Those initiatives are Neighbors Club, Digital, FAST, Fusion, and Side Lot. The strategy and its initiatives are designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunities we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. Our project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations represent significant investments in our stores. These store-level investments are designed to grow our market share and drive the productivity of both existing and new stores as part of our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's start with our Project Fusion, store remodel program. As a quick reminder, Project Fusion is state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to shop. We anticipate having about 15% of our total store base in the new Fusion layout by year-end. We've reduced the time to complete Fusion remodels by 50% since the beginning of the year, and in turn allowing us to minimize the disruption to the store operations and our customers' shopping experience. Our customers are taking note of the improved layout, the ease of shopping, and our new product offerings. Specifically in our customer intercept's survey, they call out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter aisles, and easier to navigate layout. Categories seeing the strongest lift in sales include areas like apparel, campaign in animal and power tools. Given the size of our store base, this is a multi-year opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales through productivity. Another significant component of our space productivity efforts is the transformation of our side lot. Again, as a reminder, typically there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have on the inside of our store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our side lot, with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot space has leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories. Enter new categories with a garden center and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online pickup in store capabilities for drive-through pickup. In select locations that meet sales volume thresholds, we're also adding a feed room to help deliver the bag-feed demand. And as a reminder, we are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. The addition of product categories, increased ease of shopping and new services [Indiscernible] us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged with Tractor Supply and attract new customers also to the brand. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our Side Lot space remains a significant opportunity. We anticipate of having about a 150 side lots complete across the chain as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for an expanded lawn and garden assortment. And we're even more excited than we were when we embarked on the initial test pilots late last year. As with our Fusion remodels, we continue to reduce the project timeline also here by about 50% and minimizing the disruption to our customers and store teams as we implement our findings from our test and learn process. While still early on, we are very positive about the continued refinement and learning. While implementing construction project to this scope and scale has been very challenging in the current macro-environment, we're making progress in our ability to significantly reduce construction costs, the construction time, and the corresponding disruption at the store site. While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read on sales lifts. Post the disruption period, we're seeing lifts of low single-digits for Fusion remodels and mid single-digits for combo stores, which had both Fusion and Side Lot remodels. We expect continued improvements in these results as the stores normalize and are forecasting year one lift as mid single-digits for Fusion and high single-digits for combo stores, which is on track for the expectations we had as we began these projects. Over the course of the last year, the team has done a great job operating the business at elevated levels, navigating unprecedented challenges and also executing our transformational initiatives to support our Life Out Here Strategy, and to wrap up our results clearly underscore that our strategies are working. That the team is navigating the challenges effectively. And that we're emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. We're extremely optimistic about our future as we enter one of the busiest periods in retail. My thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply Team members for their dedication and commitment to our mission and values. And with that operator, we would like to open the lines for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Thank you. You may proceed. Oliver Wintermantel : Good morning, guys. Hal, you mentioned a lot about the structural changes within the business. And my question is regarding gross margins. I think you said it's 100 basis points higher than before the pandemic in 2019. So I was wondering if you have early indications of what you think is in gross margin structural gains versus what you have to maybe give back when promotions come back on and maybe the COO decelerates from the very strong 40% to your COO. Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hey Oliver, good morning, thanks for joining our call. On gross margins, we're -- we're very pleased both with our short term results, kind of this past quarter on gross margin, and also very optimistic about the long-term nature of our gross margins. On the short-term, we've had significant amount of cost coming through our business, whether that's in cost of goods as it relates to raw materials and commodity-based goods, also vendors passing along costs related to labor and freight. We've also seen freight cost increase as well as well as costs related to imports. The team's done an excellent job navigating those costs, finding offsets, productivity measures really being the advocate for the customer to keep prices as low as possible. That's it. As Kurt mentioned, we did have inflation of 2% to 7% in the quarter, which helped us offset alot of those costs and delivered the gross margin results that we did in the quarter which sequentially from a GAAP to last year improved from Q2. Long term, as we talked about on several of our call s, the question is really around promotional intensity and the clearance intensity in the business. And those two remain at the same levels that they have over the last 6 quarters : very low. We remain very focused on everyday low price. We remain very focused on delivering value every single day to our customers, and we see it playing out that way for the foreseeable future. We have no plans for significant promotional intensity in Q4. And we think this will remain in a very supply constrained environment as we move into the first half of next year. And that too will continue to limit any sort of promotional intensity to market. And a couple of years in now with minimal promotional intensity, I think that bodes well for being able to maintain a low promotional structure going forward. And so as I said, again, we're very pleased with our short-term gross margin results and also very optimistic about the structural nature of our long-term gross margin. Oliver Wintermantel : Thanks very much. Good luck. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wintermantel. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. You may proceed. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. So based on all of those comments that you just provided Hal, the question would be on obviously the longer-term algorithm and we haven't had an update on that for a little bit but we're clearly trending well above that. So wondering if you could maybe just give a little color in how you think about long-term operating margin algorithm more broadly versus the prior 9 to 9.5, because that just obviously isn't really realistic, those lines. Hal Lawton : Hey [Indiscernible] and good morning and thanks for joining the call. We see significant growth opportunities ahead in our business which we talked about several times, $110 billion total addressable market. Super excited about our Life Out Here Strategy in a runway ahead there. And we're investing in that strategy to ensure we capture, sustainable market share. Absolute -- to your point acknowledge that absent the write-down on Petsense that we did a t 10.1% off profit in 2020 and our guidance for 2021 here at 102 to103 that both of those exceed our long-term targets. We certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves here in the third quarter. What we commented on is that, we're in the midst of our annual planning for 2022. It's -- at the same time, we're also just always looking at our long-term targets and it's very natural for us to be reviewing that over the next few months. And so, when we have more news on that, we'll certainly let folks know. But again, I think we're in a period where there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead, and we're very pleased with the results we put up this quarter, the outlook we have for the balance of the year, and also excited about the long-term opportunity that we still see out there in our $110 billion market as we are gaining significant share in it and the team is just executing on all cylinders right now. Karen Short : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Congrats on another great quarter. I think my question maybe a bit repetitive here sort of prior to, but the question I have is and Hal you mentioned the structural lot in your prepared comments from the demand side. Clearly, demand of tractor now over the last several quarters has been outstanding. You're still just very odd, presenting unique dynamic within the overall consumer environment. What -- I want to -- I guess the question I have is, what are you seeing in the business, how your consumers are performing that gives you greater confidence there was a structural shift in demand trends that will persist once the COVID crisis is completely behind us? Kurt Barton : Hey, Brian. I'd point to 3 things in our business. First off, I'll talk about broad macro trends, second thing I'll talk about is the consistency of our business, and the third I'll talk about is share gains. In the broad macro trends, all the trends that we saw in Q2 of last year really have all sustained themselves, and I think there's certain retailers and other businesses that saw the benefit as it relates to COVID behavior early to mid last year and that waned. And I think that's not been the case for us, whether it's things like rural revitalization, which is a bit more of a permanence in if people move and whether it's things like pet ownership and adoption, again, permanent more so in nature. Whether it's homesteading and just kind of the self-reliance mentality, we're seeing this as more permanent behaviors and really no matter what dataset you look at, whether it's home purchases, whether it's mobility, whether it's pet ownership, any sort of qualitative data on where people are spending their money, they all reinforce the structural nature of those trends. The second thing I'd point to is the consistency, as I mentioned. Our business has been remarkably consistent. Month to month, week to week, by category, and by region. And that's been regardless of whether or not we've been in COVID surges or whether or not certain states have been more in lock down or less in lock down. And that I think just again speaks to the structural orientation. And lastly, we're gaining significant share really in almost every category in our business. And we're seeing that share gain in our core customers who have long shopped us and as they come to us now with a confidence that we're in stock with the right level of customer service and at the right price, and then also new customers who are finding the lifestyle that we serve to be what they're seeking in this time. And we're gaining share really across the board on all of our categories in that context. I'd point to those -- to those three things that give us real confidence in the structural orientation of our business. I think it's -- there's a set of COVID winners that were early on and have seen some of that wane. And then there's another set that are seeing it much more structural and sustained. And I very much put it at the top of that second camp. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. I appreciate it and congrats again. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper and Sandler -- Piper Sandler and Co. You may proceed. Peter Keith : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Great results, everyone. Looking forward to the next couple of months with the winter here, looks like we're going to be seeing record energy prices, home heating costs. And I'm just thinking back to 10, 12 years ago with some of the heating exposure you guys have, there sometimes can be a nice benefit for Tractor. So I guess the question is on a net basis, how do you feel about this elevated heating costs that we're going to see this winter? Is it a net positive or conversely maybe elevating costs for your core consumer? Seth Estep : Hey Peter, this is Seth. Thanks for joining the call. Hey, when we look ahead over the next couple of months, just a little bit more broadly, other than just outside of energy costs as well, we're really excited about the opportunity that lies ahead based off a lot of the macro benefits that Hal just discussed and I'd love to just highlight a couple of things that we look to see to drive our business over this holiday season and then to maximize and capitalize on that opportunity. When we think about that, and we're really excited about how the team and the merchandising team continues to execute on our portfolio strategy, leveraging the Fast team. We're doing record number of resets throughout the year, not just call it preholiday, but continuing that reset and the new [Indiscernible] activity as we go through the quarter. And for holidays specifically, over the next couple of months, we're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in some of these new customer trends, as well as our core customers that are coming to us for categories more broadly than maybe they have in the past. Things like apparel and footwear. And we're seeing expansions like in key brands that consumers are really resonating with, with brands like Columbia and Harriet, Carhartt, even our own brand like Ridgecut, where we're expanding into the women's lineup where that shopper's now coming to us where they weren't in the past, where we can continue to drive market share in those categories. We're also seeing with that rural revitalization, consumers coming to us for outdoor activities, even here in the fall. So things like patio heaters, grills, even Wildlife and UTV s driving a demand, we're still seeing strength across the board there and then we're going to continue to focus on our C.U.E. activity where customers are coming to us for footsteps. So, with a record number of pet adoptions over the last few years, we continue to be extremely excited about the momentum that we have at our pet business holistically as well as the C.U.E. business, and we're going to be looking to drive that throughout the whole holiday season. It's a little broader than just the energy market question here as well, but also where we see it as we're coming through, we're seeing activity across our consumer base to be very consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters. And they are really resonating with the new items, the new categories, as well as the new partnerships that we're continuing to establish. Peter Keith : Thank you very much, Seth. Operator : The next question is from Kate McShane with Golden -- Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Kate Mc Shane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to go back to inflation for one minute. I wondered if you could talk to us about how much inflation you are expecting for the fourth quarter. And when it comes to the pricing actions that you took, was it across most of the store or in certain categories? And when do you expect or what has been the reaction from an elasticity standpoint? Kurt Barton : [Indiscernible], hey. This is Kurt. Good morning and good morning to everybody. On the inflation side of it, as Hal mentioned on the top side, there was 700 basis points of inflation benefit on the business. We saw at that or slightly higher cost pressures in Q3, as we look ahead to Q4, we exited Q3 and into Q4 with continued levels of inflation moderating at the levels compared to like what we saw coming out of Q2 into Q3. But there continues to be some levels of inflation that's factored into our guidance. In regards to how we handle that, it really is more of a portfolio approach. We take a look at where those costs are contributing, both in transportation product costs and we look at our portfolio. Seth, and the merchant team manages the shopping patterns from the customers, as well as making sure that in key traffic driving areas, we've got great everyday low pricing. So we leverage our pricing tools really well and make sure that from the portfolio standpoint that we can balance from a retail side, as well as what we can do to leverage the strength of our mature supply chain to keep cost s as low as possible. And again, our team has just managed through this great and we are forecasting our guidance for Q4 expecting that they're able to manage that in a similar pattern. Kate Mc Shane : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS, you may proceed. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks all for taking my question. Kurt, can you just clarify what you intended to say with the response to that last question in terms of the inflation contribution moderated relative to the 700 basis points, or the inflation contribution that you're expecting 4Q moderated relative to the 350 to 400 basis points, and hopefully I -- that wasn't my question but it was just a little confusing how that was answered. My question really is, moving forward, do you still need a 3% comp or so to leverage your expenses? In your prepared remarks, you noted that SG&A has leveraged 70 basis points relative to 2019. And given the sheer magnitude of the volume increase your stores have had, there would be some opportunity to right-size or manage your cost structures that you might be able to lever on a more moderate COO moving forward. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Michael, I'll hit the two questions. In response to clarification on Kate's question, for Q4 the inflation pressures on the business will be fairly similar to what we described and saw on Q3 : flattish to potentially slightly up in regards to Q4. In regards to our leverage point, where we're at right now with the business, the elevated levels of revenue growth, as well as our focus on our investments really makes the whole algorithm different than just saying is it a 3% comp that you leverage on. And to your point, right now, we're seeing really strong momentum in the business, and that does elevate our ability to leverage on the cost. But we're also using that to the point that Hal made and that I made in our prepared remarks that we definitely see this as a tremendous opportunity, we're investing from a position of strength, so our continued outlook of managing SG&A to flattish over time will still be our outlook in the way we are managing this business. Great opportunity to just continue to gain market share and drive traffic into the stores. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. You may proceed. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, we can just move on to the next question if Chris is out. Chris Horvers : Hello. Mary Winn Pilkington : Hey, there you are. Chris Horvers : Thank you, Mary Winn. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks. Chris Horvers : Seth, with your commentary around 4Q, obviously, softline slot Asian sourcing, I'm guessing the heating business and OPE, soit sounds like you're feeling good from an in-stock level there, is that accurate? And then how are you thinking about next spring? At this point you're probably making orders for that. So will you be ordering enough for next spring? Seth Estep : Hey, Chris. Yes. So we always say we're not -- we always want more, but we are satisfied with where we are right now. As we've managed through the supply chain with both our supplier partners and our supply chain team and merchants to get the products where we are, we feel really good where we are heading into the holiday season as products flowing in. As we've managed through this throughout the course of the whole year, you're spot on. We've looked at every piece of our process, we're giving earlier forecast for our key supplier partners, we're working with our overseas factories to give commitments In our earlier lead time, than we have historically so that we can properly plan within, plan through the supply chain, look for alternative ways to source product or need be to make sure that we can have product hit shelf and we're taking it, we'll be able to take it when we can get it even earlier than we have in the past as well. So that we can be locked and loaded and ready for the spring business. Really feel good about the planning that's going on across the team, and across with our supplier base to make sure that we can continue to navigate this supply -- global supply chain challenge that has been out there. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Thank you, you may proceed. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess back under the expense stuff, the investments you guys are making, obviously Capex has been up, so I'm curious just on D&A and how we're thinking about that, Kurt, for this year. And then next year we've seen this year is probably up 25% year-over-year, maybe it's $270 million of D&A. How do we think about that as you kind of pencil through 2022? Should we see a similar growth rate or -- how should we think about that? That's my question. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yeah, sure, Peter. So for this year, the depreciation growth year-over-year, throughout the quarters, mid-to-high 20% growth rate is very much in line with our expectations. The investments we've made this year, the incremental ones principally with the new distribution center build, as well as the Fusion Side Lot remodel has us right where we expected to be on depreciation. And for 2022 at this point with our plan, we would expect very much similar in the low 20% growth rate, likely and that's very much what we framed out when we launched the Life Out Here Strategy. Peter Benedict : Okay, got you. Thanks so much, Kurt. Operator : The next question is from the line of Simon Gutman with Morgan Stanley, you may proceed. Simeon Gutman : Hey everyone. Good morning. Can I -- Hal and Kurt. Maybe I will take another stab at the longer-term margin question. I think the math would suggest that your business could be running above that level. The question is, philosophically, do you let it run above that level? And Hal, in that regard, are there things along the Out Here Strategy that you can accelerate, are there price investments that you would think about? Are there any other re-investments that the layer -- second or third layers of the plan where you could lean in and just say, hey, we don't want to run the business at a higher margin so that we can keep building on the growth [Indiscernible] think about that. Hal Lawton : Hey, Gutman. Good to talk to you this morning and thanks for joining us. You had said -- first off, we see sizable opportunity ahead in our market. For those who followed us for a long period of time, it's a very attractive market. One, it's very fragmented. One, where we're very well-positioned with our scale and size and relationships that we have and investments we've made historically. We think that there are significant further opportunity as we look out. We continue to grow in an out-sized way and take share. And we're committed to going after that share, continuing to grow. That said, would acknowledge 2 straight years of performance above 10% off margin. It's above our long-term guidance. And as we go through our 2022 annual planning process, we'll be -- that will help us really think through our long-term guidance and the relevance of that as we look forward. For right now, it is our long-term guidance. What I would say is, as it relates to investments, we're very bullish on our investments, we're very focused on excellent capital allocation, we're seeing the results of our investments in the business. As we shared today, the Fusion stores and the Side Lot stores are performing very well. As they mature and begin to normalize, we're seeing the results right in line with what our expected business model and business plan for them were. That's it. Also our business is much -- continues to grow at an outsized rate and that gives us an opportunity to leverage and scale on our business in a way that we didn't fully anticipate last year at this time. And I think as we see how that continues to evolve into early next year, you can expect to hear more from us on that. But again, we remain very bullish on our opportunity, very pleased with our business, it's never been stronger, and we're excited about both the short-term and long-term potential inside of it. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning. Kurt, another expense question. As you're lapping a year of elevating COVID costs, incentive COO, and strategic spend -- so first of all, can you talk through the lingering impact of some of these items? And then as we look to 22, you mentioned an uptick in strategic spend. Is there any detail you can provide there? And then separately on the 20% D& A growth, is that with or without Orscheln? Kurt Barton : Zach, this is Kurt and a number of things in there. Let me just try to package that in this. One, I'll hit the last one first. Orscheln is not considered in any of the numbers of the guidance that we've given in regards to the depreciation expense structure. So COVID expenses have been elevated from the level that we entered the year into, just because the pandemic with the Delta variant and others have lingered. They're at lower levels than we saw in comparable quarters last year but we continue to emphasize having a safe and clean environment for our customers and our team members. The incentive comp with the outperformance this year, while at lower levels than last year, continued to be above target. And so we should think about going forward those are items for us as in future years, those are leveraged points. And if, like in this year, while there's incentive comp above target, the performance gives leverage above and beyond the level that we're paying an incentive comp. So it's net an overall leverage this year, and next year those will be favorable items to compare again. The depreciation expense, as I mentioned earlier, the growth rate that I quoted and referring to is very much in line with what we expected in our long-range plan when we launched the Life Out Here Strategy and talked about a 3 year to 5 year plan. And so with the elevated sales, I mean, we feel very comfortable with a 20% growth rate in depreciation because that's where those investments are at, does not include Orscheln, and again, we're very comfortable with the management we've got and what we have visibility on our expenses for the fourth quarter and even the near term beyond that. Zach Fadem : Got it.Thanks, Kurt, what about the strategic side? Kurt Barton : The strategic initiative that we've had -- we haven't really specifically mentioned any increased spend on strategic initiatives outside of what we had planned in the Life Out Here Strategy on technology, digital that we had this year and we'll continue to execute the plan. So maybe just clarify what you're referring there. Zach Fadem : You mentioned you were going to continue to invest in 2022 so I was just curious if there was an uptick in strategic spend that we should anticipate. Kurt Barton : Got you, Zach. No, it's very much in line with what we said that our capital expenditures over the next few years. We anticipate those still to be in that 450 to 550 some years, could be higher because of launching of distribution centers. But the level investment in the businesses is consistent with what we expect. Zach Fadem : Got it. Appreciate the time today. Operator : The next question is from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush you may proceed. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is just a clarification around the trends you're seeing in terms of the comp lift following the Fusion and Side Lot roll out. I think you said you're seeing low single-digit for Fusion, mid single-digit for combo stores and stores that have been completed. But your plan is for a full first year list of mid single-digits for Fusion and high single-digits for combos? Is that correct? Kurt Barton : Hey, good morning. And yes, that is what we said in our prepared remarks and it is accurate. The add that I'd make to that is just as is typical with a store remodel, Hal Lawton : There's a little bit of disruption. There's disruption that happens during the remodel. Particularly with the current supply chain environment, there's a little disruption that's occurring still even after the remodel as some fixtures and other types of things come in some months a little late. That -- and then we start to see the lift happen as customers getting used to shopping, the new layout and find the new categories and the new brands and the new remodel. What we're seeing is what we would expect, which is every week, every month that goes by post kind of the re-grand opening of the remodel that the performance of the store continues to improve. And that's the case of both combo stores and the Fusion remodel. The other that I would make to that is as it relates to the Side Lot with the Garden Center. We have a couple of stores that went through year 2 of spring. We saw outsized gains in those which is in line again with our expectation that we would see more of a maturity curve with the Garden Center than we would with the inside of the store Fusion remodel. We think that and we expect and what we're seeing in the Fusion remodel, it's more of an immediate impact with the maturity curve being more of 3, 4, 5, 6 months maturity curve, whereas for the Garden Center, we're seeing a nice, strong immediate impact, but then we're also seeing 12, 18 months continuation of that maturity curve. But yeah, the results are very much in line, nice positive lift already, even a few months into each of the remodels. And then we see even continued lift as we complete year 1 of those remodels, whether it's Fusion or the combo. Seth Basham : That's helpful. Just a point for clarification. When do you start measuring lift post disruption? How many months after the completion does disruption period end? Hal Lawton : Yeah, we start measuring lift the day of the re-grand opening. So not to get too tactical, but there's a sign off that the store manager and the project manager and the construction manager do that on the day that sign off, that's when the project is complete. The re-grand opening happens reasonably quickly after that, 1 week, 2 weeks kind of thing, and then we start measuring the lift from that re-grand opening date. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. You may proceed. Chuck Grom : Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Great quarter [Indiscernible] let me look at the Side Lot initiative. I'm curious to what's been the biggest areas of upside surprise for you guys or said differently. What have you learned in the class of 21 Side Lot? So, you would look to apply to future, store efforts and then any sense for where you think the productivity longer-term could be relative to your in-store productivity? Hal Lawton : Hey, Chuck and thanks for joining the call today. I'll hit kind of three things on Side Lot and then I'll just briefly touch base on Fusion productivity. On the Side Lot, the 3 things I'll talk about is the Garden Center, I'll talk about BOPIS, and then I'll talk about our feed rooms. So first on the Garden Center. Our customers key data set is that the categories that we least address from a destination perspective, that they most engage in is live goods and garden. And so that's really what the Garden Center strategy is all about, is creating another C.U.E. destination category in our business. And -- but we're seeing that in our results. I'd say we're more excited now about the prospects for adding to our fleet the Garden sooner than we were even this time last year. And the -- just tax and the behavior we're seeing our customers exactly what you expect. It's a little less around beautification, like what you might see in a more of a home improvement store, in terms of the core product, and much more about fruits and vegetables and shrubs and trees. All those sorts of things that really speak to Life Out Here, whether it's the gardening you do in your backyard or whether it's the shrubs and the tree you're planning along your fence line and in -- along -- in your land. And we have significant convenience benefit -- kind of advantages for our customers from a location perspective. So the Garden Center s are performing very well and we're just getting started both on the build-out of those, obviously, but also with our relationships with our live goods vendors and the assortments, tailoring it by store. The second thing is on BOPIS drive-thru. We're seeing incredibly high levels of drive-thru behavior from our customers. And we're seeing in -- some of our stores that have been open for 4, 5, 6, 8 months now, we're seeing 50%, 60%, 75%. the bio line pickup in store being drive-through and just that extra convenience factor you're seeing with customers. And then that's driving repeat behavior. And so really pleased with how that's evolving and the behavior we're seeing from our customers is consistent with what the feature was when we rolled it out. And then lastly is the feed room. We are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. And if you think about our average store volumes and the growth we've seen in those store volumes combined with the outsized performance in Q, that's put a lot of stress on our stores as it relates to the receipt of bad good s, getting it out onto the store, staying in stock for our customers, and then being able to get that onto customers' trucks and out the -- towards -- get them on their way. And the feed rooms have provided valuable capacity and also allowed us to effectively, from a cost perspective, serve the customer. We're not touching the bags 2, 3, 4 times. We're able to leverage our mixing centers in a way that they're designed now. And so all 3 of those things are really coming together, we're seeing excellent performance across all 3 exactly as we designed them and built them and we're continuing to use our test and learn to tweak it along the way. As you think about our productivity, as we move forward, we're still committed to our comps outpacing overall retail and outpacing the Life Out Here market that we define as that a $110 billion market. And so you can expect continued productivity improvements on our same-store sales in an outsized way as we move forward. We even in spite of 6 consecutive quarters now with double-digit comps, we still have that expectations moving forward. One other thing, while I've got the mike here so to speak. I'd like to just step back and reference there's a bit about our long-term op margin leverage as Kurt was talking about. What I'd say is if you look at our long-term guidance through there are several questions on this topic. Our long-term guidance that we announced last year had 6% to 7% sales growth and 8% to 10% earnings per diluted share, which implies continued leverage on the business as we move forward. And we're not in a state of normalcy right now, obviously with our comps being the sixth consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, but what I would say, the spirit of the continued leverage, you are seeing in our results. And that is the expectation we have of our business, whether we're seeing outsize costs for labor and outsize cost from freight and cost of goods or whether that's in a more normal environment. And so we're holding ourselves accountable to executing in that way, regardless of the environment that we're in. And just wanted to clarify that. I think Kurt 's point around 3% comp and whether that's a point of leverage is still accurate in a normal environment, but we still, even in a kind of \"non -normal environment\" still accept that same challenge. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Thanks, Hal and Operator, that will conclude our call today. I really appreciate everybody's cooperation that allowed us to get through a lot more questions, so thank you all. Looking forward to speaking to you in January on our fourth quarter earnings call and Maryanne and I will be around this afternoon for any questions, so thank you all for your cooperation. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Before Hal and Kurt joined us, we wanted to share some of the big wins for Tractor Supply in 2021, many of which we will be discussing later today in detail. Let\u2019s take a look. [Video Presentation] Hal Lawton : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are here in cold Nashville. We are excited to update you in greater detail on our Life Out Here strategy that we first shared with you back in October 2020. As our Year Review video highlighted, we are just getting started. At Tractor Supply, we are very early on our journey to build on the momentum in our business and capture the tremendous growth opportunities that we see ahead of us. As we operated early through the early days of the pandemic back in 2020, we set our sights on ensuring that our business would emerge stronger than before. Today, our business has never been stronger. We have significant momentum, our team is executing at a high level and our results demonstrate that our multiyear Life Out Here strategy is working. We are operating from a position of strength. We have a lot of exciting news and progress we want to share with you today. Kurt and I will take you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results and review our outlook for 2022 before the team provides an update on our strategic priorities. Retail is ever evolving, that our most important strategic asset remains constant in our team members. They nurture our relationship with our customers and they make us who we are and what we stand for as a company. As a purpose-driven company, our team members create a sense of community in our stores and with each other. Our 46,000 team members are passionate about Life Out Here. Over the last 22 months of the pandemic, they have lived our mission and values to ensure that Tractor Supply is the dependable supplier that our customers count on. This team has worked diligently with grit and determination to overcome the challenging operating environment. They have come together to support the increased sales volume through our DCs, to our stores and online, welcome new customers into the lifestyle, onboarded new team members and navigated the supply chain disruptions. We have enhanced our IT capabilities and done so much more. My thanks goes out to their hard work and dedication to each other, our customers and the communities we call home. Thanks to the team. 2021 was a record year for our business as we successfully comped our record performance in 2020. And as we will share throughout today\u2019s presentation, we are benefiting from the many market trends that continue to be structurally sound. So, let\u2019s recap a few of the milestones in 2021. We celebrated the opening of our 2,000th store in December right here in our home state of Tennessee. We announced the acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home. And we remain committed to the acquisition, which continues to be reviewed by the FTC and we hope to have an update soon. The strength in our customer base is supporting our market share gains across our categories. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program is growing with membership up 24% year-over-year as we transition from an affinity program to a tier rewards program. We have robust retention rates and engagement, especially with our highest value tier members. We are committed to making Tractor Supply a household name. Through our targeted investments in marketing, we are seeing a remarkable increase of 21 points in our unaided brand awareness. We are also investing in our supply chain as we announced the first of 3 new distribution centers over the next 5 years. And in September, we announced new robust ESG goals to further reduce our carbon emissions from our operations as well as new diversity equity inclusion goals. And the team has done a remarkable job managing through the well-documented challenges across the global supply chain and dealt with an unprecedented level of inflation. We have tremendous strength and it is broad-based. And now, let me provide some specific color on our fourth quarter performance. Our comparable store sales grew a robust 12.7% and this represents a 40% stack on a 2-year basis. Continuing the trend, we have had several quarters now. Every week was positive with broad-based strength across all regions and all categories. We believe we are significantly outpacing the industry in our growth and continuing to gain market share both online and in store. Inflation, it contributed over 850 basis points to comparable store sales as we navigated the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. And our merchants and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well and they are most focused on being that advocate for our customer to be everyday low price. As we closely monitor our customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors, we are focused on product unit trends and as I said, we are committed to being priced right everyday. Consumable, usable and edible products, they continue to perform well with comps above the chain average. These categories, as we discussed often are needs-based, demand-driven and they drive trips to Tractor Supply. And key categories in our C.U.E. area, dry dog food, livestock feed, equine health and pet treats were among some of the strongest categories that continue to perform very well. While we were comping exceptional strength in the fourth quarter of last year for our big ticket categories, we had double-digit growth again this quarter. Looking at the cadence for the quarter, December was modestly below October and November comp performance. And as a reminder, December was the warmest on record in 30 plus years. That said, we exited the quarter strong as weather normalized and as we all know, January has started off quite cold. So to recap our sales performance, we had a remarkable year with consistency that gives us confidence that the trends we are experiencing are more structural in nature. The execution by our team has been excellent. Our store teams and distribution centers, along with our supply chain partners, have navigated another challenging year with outstanding execution of our operational playbook. We have faced every challenge head on, focused on controlling what we control, all the while staying true to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. The strength and diversity of our comp growth in 2021 on top of our record results in 2020 is very compelling. As evidenced in our share gains, the health of our customer continues to be very robust. All customer segments had strong growth with the fastest growth in our core farm and ranch segment. We continue to see stellar performance from our highest spending customers. Our retention rates remain higher than historical standards, and it\u2019s even higher from our Neighbor\u2019s Club members. 1 in 5 or 20% of our new customers came to Tractor Supply through our digital channels in the fourth quarter, reinforcing the importance of the investments we are making in this area. We are supercharging how we serve customers with convenience and meeting them how they want to engage with us. To recap, we are experiencing more customers shopping us than ever before. They are visiting us more frequently. And when they come to shop with us, whether it\u2019s in our stores or online, they are spending more money per trip. Throughout the team\u2019s upcoming presentations today, you will learn much more about our plans to continue to build on this positive momentum that we have with our customers. Before we get to the update on our Life Out Here strategy, Kurt will go through some of the key highlights of our fourth quarter and share more details around our 2022 financial outlook. Kurt? Kurt Barton : Thanks, Hal and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate your time and attention today to hear more about our substantial progress and our very bright future. As Hal covered a good bit about our top line results and impressive customer trends, I will pickup with our gross margin performance. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate was 33.8%, a decrease of 83 basis points versus last year. This was generally in line with our expectation as we expected inflationary pressures to continue in both product and transportation costs. As has been very well documented, the cost environment remains elevated across imports and domestic freight, commodities and labor wages. Hal shared with you our approach to managing through the current environment. I commend our team for the great job they are doing in the current environment. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our retail price management program. The fourth quarter comparable ticket growth included the benefit of approximately 850 basis points of inflation. For fiscal 2021, inflation benefited comp sales by approximately 550 basis points. Across the network, we have been nimble to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures. Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. Turning to SG&A, our fourth quarter adjusted SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 68 basis points versus last year to 24.9%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales, along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. This leverage was partially offset by higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing a great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. Moving to our profitability, adjusted operating profit increased 13.4%, adjusted net income increased 14.6% and diluted earnings per share was $1.93, an increase of 17.7% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter of last year. This slide recaps our record performance for the year, all on an adjusted basis. Our operating income increased 22%. And for the fiscal year, we had an operating profit margin of 10.3%. Net income was just under $1 billion, with diluted EPS growth of over 25% for the year. Turning now to a few additional financial highlights, the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. Fiscal 2021 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.14 billion. Our balance sheet remains incredibly healthy and we exited the year with a 2x leverage ratio. At the end of the year, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion and on a per store basis, inventory increased about 15%. This increase reflects our commitment to support our strong sales trends and be in stock for our customers, along with an increase from inflation. In 2021, the team opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to see very robust new store economics. For the full year, we returned a total of around $1 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. With another year of remarkable performance in the books, let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for 2022. We detailed our 2022 guidance in our press release, but I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. We have momentum. We will continue to invest in the business through our Life Out Here strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. And this team is committed to doing just that. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. This uncertainty includes product cost inflation and supply chain constraints as well as the impact that these factors will have on the broader economy and the consumer. As a needs-based business, Tractor Supply has a long history of resilience during volatility. Starting with sales, please keep in mind that we are cycling tailwinds from generally favorable weather and government stimulus, principally in the first half of the year. With that backdrop, we believe we can comp the comp as our view is that our customer is healthy, even despite their concerns over the state of the broader economy. We anticipate the insights and initiatives you will hear more about today, including Neighbor\u2019s Club, Digital, Fusion and Side Lot and investments in the customer experience to contribute to our positive comp range of 3% to 4.5%. We are planning for positive comp transaction growth. We are also planning for positive ticket growth, which assumes an inflation benefit of approximately 4 percentage points. This is partially offset by an average ticket decline from lapping the strength in big ticket and other select categories from last year\u2019s stimulus benefit. The 53rd week adds about 1.5 percentage points of net sales growth for fiscal 2022 and about $0.15 of earnings per diluted share. Please keep in mind the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home is not included in our guidance. We believe gross margin and SG&A will remain flattish to the prior year. Key drivers for gross margin include assumptions that transportation and inflation pressures will continue, but at a slightly lesser pace offset by our price management and continued limited promotions. Turning to SG&A, we are planning to make investments in strategic initiatives and wages, offset by leverage of fixed costs, normalized incentive compensation expense, reduced COVID costs and operational efficiencies. As to the cadence of the business in 2022, Q1 is our toughest compare at 39% sales comp, benefiting from favorable weather and stimulus. In 2021, we estimated those two had 9 points of comp benefit on the first quarter. The gross margin and overall operating margin are also the toughest compare in Q1 as we had favorable mix of product due to weather and strong leverage on comps and limited pressure from inflation. We anticipate comps to be flat to slightly positive in Q1, driven primarily from positive comp ticket. Q4 will have the strongest year-over-year sales growth due to the 53rd week. Sales comps are expected to be relatively consistent in Q2 through Q4, all within our guidance range. Our ninth distribution center is expected to begin operating in the fall. Our outlook is for capital spending in the range of $625 million to $675 million, with 70% for growth initiatives. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $70 million, up about 25% year-over-year due to the investments in our business. We anticipate continuing our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. We are planning on share repurchases of $700 million to $800 million, with an expected 2% net reduction in weighted shares outstanding. To wrap up, 2022 is positioned to be a great year for Tractor Supply. There is no doubt that Tractor Supply is stronger than we were entering the pandemic. We are delivering against our goals. And most importantly, we have a compelling, incredible plan to continue to grow. I look forward to sharing more on our long-term outlook later in the presentation. Now, let me turn it back to Hal to share a broader update on our Life Out Here strategy. Hal? Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Wow, what again outstanding 2021 on top of a record 2020. Yes, the team did a great job, they did, just fantastic. Alright. Let\u2019s transition out of a typical earnings dialogue and look to the future. We have a very bright past with more than 83 years of serving Life Out Here. We are coming off a record 2 years of performance. But from our point of view, we are just getting started. We believe Tractor Supply is well-positioned for a bright future. We are in the early stages of the next transformation of Tractor Supply. This transformation should allow us to both grow our top line and earnings sustainably over a long period of time, while operating at a higher margin profile. Given the robust growth of our stores and online that have experienced, we have had a step function change in our business that is evident in our market share gains, sales growth and profitability. We are dedicated to investing and to continue strengthening our position in the marketplace and separate ourselves from our competition. We are committed to creating sustainable value creation for all of shareholders, for our team members, our customers, for the communities we call home, for our supply chain and vendor partners and ultimately, our shareholders. The roots of our long history of growth were established in 1938 when C.E. Schmidt founded a mail order catalog for tractor parts. We opened our first store in Minot, North Dakota, the following year. We serve Life Out Here. We are focused on the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle. As I mentioned earlier, in December, we celebrated our 2,000th store opening in White House, Tennessee. This is a testament to all of our team members who continue to support each other, our customers and our communities. Not many companies have gotten to this milestone and I doubt C.E. Schmidt ever imagined this milestone when he started his tractor parts catalog business 83 years ago. Our mission and values are the foundation for our success. Our culture is shaped around our mission and values. We have lived by these principles for over 80 years and we will continue to do so for decades to come. Our mission and values help us in our business decisions and they serve as guiding beacons to ensure we maintain course even in uncertain times. It is not something that you can put in a financial model, but it makes a huge difference on our bottom line, but they are more than that. Our mission and values are what you feel when you walk into one of our stores and talk with one of our team members. We are not like other retailers. We are a relationship retailer. Our customers are passionate about family, their land and animals and their communities and they count on us, Tractor Supply, to be their dependable supplier. We are able to serve our customers so well, because we know our customers so well. We hire our customers. Our team members are members of and representative of the community. They are experts in equine and welding, gardening and pets. They are involved in 4-H and FFA. Our team members are the largest and most important strategic asset of our company. And I encourage you all to visit us out here to experience it for yourself. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to preserving Life Out Here for future generations. 13 years ago, we launched our stewardship program. As ESG has emerged as the universal standard for good corporate citizenship, we have adapted our stewardship program to align with this direction. And over the past year, we have made significant progress in our ESG efforts. A few highlights include significantly reducing our energy and water consumption, materially increasing the gender and ethnic diversity of our board, management executive committee and our overall team member population, conducting unconscious bias training for over 40,000 team members and implementing a new 6-week paid parental leave policy for full-time salary and hourly team members. In September of 2021, we announced new robust goals to further reduce our carbon emissions as well as continue our progress on diversity, equity and inclusion. After exceeding our initial carbon reduction goals set in 2018, Tractor Supply established more aggressive commitments. By 2025, we will reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from what they were in 2020. By 2030, we will reduce those emissions by 50%. And by 2040, we\u2019re committed to achieving net zero emissions across all our operations. Over the past 2 years, we\u2019ve rallied around the theme of stronger together and made material investments to accelerate our initiatives for DE&I. Recently, we announced a 5-year goal to support and advance underrepresented groups across our workforce, vendors, suppliers and communities. Our commitment to being a good corporate citizen has been broadly recognized. Recently, we were named to Investor Business Daily\u2019s 100 Best ESG Companies of 2021. Just yesterday, it was announced we were included in Bloomberg\u2019s Gender Equality Index. And today, it was announced that we received a perfect score from the Human Rights Council. We are committed to being a leader in ESG as this is authentic to our mission and values while also making great business sense. Over our rich 83-year history, this business has a strong track record of success, complemented by consistency and resiliency. Highlights include 30 consecutive years of revenue gain, 12 consecutive positive comp store sales growth and an average share price performance of 28.3% since the year 2000. And this ranks as the fourth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 over the last 21 years. Thank you to our investors for their confidence and we continue to strive to earn your trust and build on it. And today is all about that, the future of Tractor Supply. As demonstrated by the highlights of 2021 that you saw in our opening video, our business has never been stronger. Our team has done an outstanding job navigating the challenges in ever-changing environment over the last 2 years. We\u2019re benefiting from many market trends that continue to be structurally sound. We have strengthened our customer base, and we\u2019re gaining market share across our categories. Importantly, our total addressable market has grown materially, and we see significant opportunities for organic growth as well as an increased number of new stores. And we will continue to invest from a position of strength to capture this growth through our Life Out Here strategy. Out here, Tractor Supply enjoys significant structural advantages. And these advantages have allowed us to gain substantial share over the past 2 years. Our unaided brand awareness is 55%. And that puts us among the best in retail and well above our farm and ranch competitors. With a network of over 2,000 stores and nearly $1 billion in digital business, supported by 8 million square feet across our distribution centers, we have a unique ability to serve our customers wherever and however they choose to shop. We believe no other rural lifestyle retailer provides a comparable experience. And we have deep relationships with our vendors and in many cases are their largest customer. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program has 23.6 million members. It is engineered to drive customer behavior, and it is the foundation for a sophisticated marketing platform and enables deep customer insights. Our brand, scale, our supply chain, our digital capabilities, our loyalty program, all in combination creates significant and enduring strategic advantages for our business. Our structural advantages are the result of long-term investments in the foundation of our business and the deep seated values embedded in our culture. These roots have enabled us to adapt in the face of the pandemic and the ripple effects of other impacts like the tight labor market, unprecedented inflation and supply chain challenges that are impacting our industry. At the same time, broad-based macro category trends towards self reliance, world revitalization, pet adoption, home setting, these things are benefiting our business. And when you add to that, the acceleration of trip consolidation as people are shopping single retailers more, you think about the adoption of digital trends and you put all these themes together and they are working to our advantage as customers value us for our proximity as a one-stop shop grows. These lifestyle changes are accompanied by long-term commitments by our customer to care for and maintain their land and animals. We believe these trends have staying power and are structurally and substantially sound. These changes align with our investments in the business and dovetail well with our strategic positioning as the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. And as the dependable supplier for Life Out Here, we offer a wide assortment for our customers\u2019 lifestyle. Our total addressable market is large and growing, and it\u2019s heavily fragmented. In 2019, we estimated the total addressable market for Tractor Supply to be about $110 billion and we shared that with you in October of 2020. Today, we estimate our addressable market to be much larger at $180 billion. The tailwinds and structural changes that we just outlined earlier contributed an estimated $30 billion increase in the TAM. And that\u2019s a 25% growth over the past 2 years in our market. But by comparison, if you look at our business, we grew 50% over the past 2 years and consequently gained significant share in this market. Now in addition to our core market, we\u2019ve expanded our TAM by over $40 billion given our investments and initiatives like Project Fusion and Side Lot, which have expanded our category offerings in areas like pet and lawn and garden. With a market share of about 7% of this $180 billion market, we see substantial opportunity for growth in an increasingly attractive market, both deepening our relationship with our current customers as well as reaching new customers. Given our total addressable market growth, continued strong performance of our new stores and our strategic initiatives, we\u2019re revising our long-term store targets from 2,500 to 2,700 Tractor Supply stores in the United States. And we\u2019re excited to serve 700-plus more communities over the next decade. Of note, we view the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to our overall store growth opportunity. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continue to have strong new store productivity metrics, with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis. And our stores are profitable in year 1. With compelling returns, we continue to have significant runway for growth with high-return new stores. Given the attractiveness of our market, we\u2019re investing in growth through our Life Out Here strategy. We shared this strategy with you in the fall of 2020. And as a reminder, there are 5 pillars of our strategy, and they include deliver legendary customer experiences which focuses on driving greater traffic and increasing conversion; number two, advancing our ONETractor capabilities to reach new customers and deepen our connection with existing customers by offering a truly omni-channel experience; number three, operate The Tractor Way, which enhances the productivity and efficiency of our existing retail assets; number four, go the country mile for our team to ensure we continue to support and show our appreciation for our team members who drive our business every day; and then number five, generate healthy shareholder returns, which reinforces our commitment to effective stewardship of our shareholders\u2019 capital. To support these transformational growth initiatives, we increased our capital investments from $275 million in 2019 to over $600 million in 2021. We made excellent progress in year 1 of our strategy and are on track with our expectations. We continue to be very excited about our strategy given our customers\u2019 response, the performance of the key initiatives and the robust long-term growth prospects. Two key tenets of our Life Out Here strategy are the Fusion and Side Lot initiatives. They are designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. Project Fusion is a multiyear store remodel program that both revitalizes the store environment and introduces an improved layout and expanded offerings. These changes are designed with the customer and our team members in mind to drive productivity through areas like enhanced experiences like pet washes and wellness clinics, but operational improvements as well to better support growing demand, things like our feed rooms. Also, though, driving space allocation trade-offs such as the service desk, but also widening our assortment across departments like apparel and animal and tools. Complementing Project Fusion is the Side Lot initiative, which transforms and expands our existing outdoor side lot retail space to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a garden center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omni-channel technology investments. Importantly, these projects are delivering on the return expectations with material sales lifts, existing customer sentiment improvements and new customer acquisition. By 2026, nearly 100% of the store base will be in the Fusion layout, and 60% to 70% will have had executed the Side Lot initiative in it. By 2022, we plan to exit the year with nearly 30% of our chain in the Fusion layout and over 15% of our chain with Side Lot. And Seth will take us through a more detailed walk of these exciting transformations later in the presentation. Another key component of our Life Out Here strategy is the enhanced focus on customer service. This isn\u2019t just about training, but also about enabling our team members to spend more time with our customers. To accomplish this, we rolled out the FAST program, the Field Activity Support Team. And we started this program with 1,200 team members in late 2020. And we expanded it by another 200 in 2021 and plan to add 300 to 400 more team members in the first half of this year. This team\u2019s sole focus is on merchandising execution. And this specialization improves our store merchandising while simultaneously enabling our store team members to focus more time on customer service. And with over 95% on-time planogram completion, our stores have never looked better or been more shoppable for our customers. And this team enables improved store productivity and is funded significantly by our vendor partners. It\u2019s truly a winning-winning program for all of our stakeholders. And John will share more details on our initiatives to fuel our legendary customer service later on. Tractor Supply is fortunate to have a highly engaged and loyal customer base. Last year, as we discussed, we converted our Neighbor\u2019s Club from an affinity program to a tiered points-based reward program. Simply said, the more you spend, the more you save. And this conversion is resonating with our customers. And year-over-year, we\u2019ve added 4.6 million new customers to the program, and we\u2019re seeing broad strength continuing across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping at Tractor Supply. And these customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip. We\u2019re experiencing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. Our retention rates continue to run above our historical standards. And I\u2019m excited for you to hear more customer insights and details on how we intend to continue to engage our new customers and drive retention of our existing customers from Christi. More than 5 years ago, we introduced our ONETractor strategy that drove significant progress in providing a seamless customer experience. Our focus on engaging with our customers anytime, anywhere and any way they choose has allowed us to reach nearly $1 billion in e-commerce sales last year. Our customer is deeply engaged with Tractor Supply. And this transformation is happening across the whole shopper journey. Our customer behaviors continue to evolve, embracing convenient ways of shopping with a continued preference for mobility. Since launching our mobile app in late 2020, we\u2019ve had 2 million-plus downloads, with the app already $100-plus million platform for us. We remain focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms. As we enter 2022, we are more excited than ever about the future of Tractor Supply. We see significant opportunity to continue to grow the business, expand our competitive moat and drive business productivity all the while creating value for our shareholders. As we\u2019ve completed the rollout of FAST and Neighbor\u2019s Club, we freed up some bandwidth, and that\u2019s going to allow us to focus on two new initiatives as well as evolve the focus of our digital initiative. The first one is lead with legendary service. We consistently rank in the top 10% to 20% of retailers on customer service, right out there with the best of them. But our goal is to be number one. And we have all the assets to achieve it. We\u2019ve got the right format, the right team, the right culture. And we have made and will be making investments in our team, in their technology and in their training. And you\u2019re going to hear more from John on our plans in this area in his presentation. Increasing mobile engagement. Mobile will be the next moat that we create around our business. We\u2019re going to convert our nearly 24 million Neighbor\u2019s Club members into power users. And Rob will share more highlights of our plans to accelerate our growth and achieve more than $2 billion in digital sales by 2026. Deliver on C.U.E. We talked often about how important this business is to us. We have the number one market share in bag feed, and we\u2019re in the top five in pet food. And given our growth in these categories over the past 2 years, we\u2019ve increased cubic volume by 26% running through our stores compared to 2019. These are destination categories. And it is critical for us to ensure we have capacity for future growth and, importantly, that we are the lowest cost to serve in the market in these categories. And our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on C.U.E. And Colin will share more details on our ability to continue to widen the gap with our competition. Given our recent performance, and the significant opportunity that I\u2019ve just outlined, we\u2019re updating our long-term guidance. Now we\u2019re maintaining our sales outlook of plus 6% to plus 7% in spite of a much higher base of sales. We\u2019re increasing our operating margin guidance to a range of 10.1% to 10.6%, and that\u2019s an increase from our previous guidance of 9% to 9.5%. We\u2019re also increasing the top end of our range for EPS growth to 11%. And notably, we\u2019re increasing our dividend payout to 40% while maintaining our commitment to share repurchases. And we\u2019re spending approximately $650 million annually of capital. These are aggressive but achievable targets that will create significant shareholder value over time. And Kurt will share more details as he focuses on our ability to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. From our founding 83 years ago, Tractor Supply has proven to be a business model that has stood the test of time to be resilient and differentiated. This business has shown the ability to evolve over the years to reflect our customers\u2019 changing needs. And we\u2019re investing to continue to evolve and capture the significant opportunities for growth. And underpinning our strategy is an experienced retail team that knows retail and our culture and our team members, and they are passionate about the out here lifestyle. As we enter year 2 of our multiyear Life Out Here strategy, our business is substantially stronger than before the pandemic. Our resilient and differentiated business model allows us to capitalize on the structural consumer trends, benefiting our business with a long runway of growth ahead of us. We have momentum in our business. And our results demonstrate that our multiyear Life Out Here strategy is working. We will continue to evolve our business from a position of strength. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it to the team to walk you through more detailed plans. Thanks so much. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Hal. Building on Hal\u2019s outlook on the positive momentum of our Life Out Here strategy is Senior Vice President of Marketing, Christi Korzekwa. Christi will share insight on our potential to capitalize on consumer behavior trends that emerged during the pandemic and several exciting initiatives to forge a deeper connection with our growing customer base. Christi? Christi Korzekwa : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning. As you\u2019ve already heard from Hal and Kurt, our future at Tractor Supply is extremely bright and promising, that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to take a few minutes and give you an update on our customers, provide some insights into what we know about our ever-expanding marketplace and how we are using our industry-leading Neighbor\u2019s Club program to drive our growth. Most importantly, we continue to see significant growth in the farm and ranch market which, as previously mentioned, we estimate to be more than $180 billion. And the pandemic continues to reshape and rewrite customer behavior. And it\u2019s why we see such a large migration of customers from urban centers to rural and suburban areas moving into Tractor Supply\u2019s neighborhoods. We also have seen customers\u2019 homes become their sanctuaries during the pandemic, inspiring more home, outdoor living and land projects. And we only see that continuing as hybrid workforces are the new norm. We\u2019ve also seen more pets become family members with record adoptions across the U.S. And with the pandemic\u2019s disruptions to daily life and the broader supply chain, we\u2019re recognizing a growing interest in self-reliance, sustainability and the desire to consolidate shopping trips. And this migration into a more rural, self-reliant lifestyle, or what we call Life Out Here, we believe, is a continuing cycle with lasting tailwinds. And according to our analysis, we have the potential to capture the interest of more than 40 million additional customers in our trade areas who do not shop at Tractor Supply today. So let me share some insights into our current customers. We\u2019re seeing significant expansion with increased participation from our core farm and ranch customers and a surge in new customers. Core farm and ranch customers increased the number of animals and pets they care for and they expanded their gardens and land projects. They rely on Tractor to be open and ready to support them and they prefer Tractor over our competition. Based on data from Earnest Research, since the onset of the pandemic, Tractor Supply has seen six consecutive quarters of outpacing the farm and ranch channel in market share gains. And beyond our core customer, we have seen record levels of new customers as more move into our trade areas, adopt new pets, start of flock, and grow gardens. What both customer groups share is a passion or growing passion for Life Out Here. And with the increase in share among existing customers and the addition of so many new customers, our investment in and growth of the Neighbor\u2019s Club to a best-in-class loyalty program this past year is key to our success. We\u2019ve reimagined our Neighbor\u2019s Club program to enhance our Neighbor\u2019s Club members\u2019 benefits and experiences. Based on feedback from our customers, we relaunched the Neighbor\u2019s Club program last April, creating a tier-based program, enabling members to earn loyalty points tied to their spending levels. They can also access tier-specific benefits such as same-day delivery and trailer rentals. In essence, the more they spend, the more benefits they receive. And we continue to enhance the program with new benefits and member exclusive experiences every day. We see this program as another differentiator for Tractor Supply. No other farm and ranch program offers the scale and exclusivity of benefits that Neighbor\u2019s Club can offer our members. The response to our Neighbor\u2019s Club enhancements continues to be overwhelmingly positive as it increases customer retention and market share. Our program enrollment is now 23.6 million members strong and we added over 4.6 million members in the last 12 months. Our members represent 70% of our sales, they shop more frequently and they spend 3x more than nonmembers. We also annually retain over 97% of our high-value Neighbor\u2019s Club members. And 90% of those members were active in the last 3 months. Our overall customer retention and recency is industry-leading. In addition, we\u2019re seeing new customers join the program at record levels, with over 30% of all new customers joining with their initial purchase. We also continue to gain extremely rich and valuable insights about our customers and they are shopping us more frequently and across more categories. For example, taking a deeper dive into our core customers, we\u2019ve seen explosive growth in our high-value farm and ranch customers. The number of extremely loyal customers, those who spend greater than $1,000 per year, has grown over 50% since 2019. While many of these customers rely on us for feed and supplies to take care of their growing pets and animals, we\u2019ve learned they also shopped more broadly across our store as part of the continued change to consolidate all of their shopping trips. And we discovered their spending was structural across more high-repeat categories, including pet food, gardening, tools, home and outdoor living, supporting their self-reliant mindset for their families, homes, animals and land. Here is a snapshot of a customer from our highest loyalty tier, Preferred Plus. Jake has been a Tractor Supply regular for years, but we can see he\u2019s changed his behavior over time, shopping more at the store and more categories each year. Many of them repeat consumable categories. He now spends approximately $4,500 each year and shops over 30x. Analysis of his transaction shows he regularly shops our pet food and feed categories, but he also frequently expand his basket with purchases in other categories like gardening and outdoor living. It\u2019s so exciting to see millions of our high-value customers shop us in a similar fashion. But also playing a meaningful part in our growth are the 19 million new customers we\u2019ve welcomed since the beginning of the pandemic. Many customers made initial trips in 2020 for home and yard improvement projects to shop for pets as well as for initial purchases in the backyard poultry and gardening categories. Because of our Neighbor\u2019s Club program, we quickly recognized the surge of new customers early in the pandemic. And we were able to develop dedicated relevant marketing messages to connect with these new customers drive awareness for our pet, home and poultry-related offerings. These efforts help a record number of our new customers, with the highest recorded retention. Over 55% of our new customers returned to Tractor Supply for another purchase. These 10 million-plus new customers are engaging in high repeat activities, such as starting a new garden, adopting a new pet or starting a flock. And to bring these new customers to life, the data from our Neighbor\u2019s Club regarding our new customers\u2019 show they tend to be younger, more female and digitally engaged. We\u2019re also seeing more millennials, who represent 30% of our new customers. Sarah is an excellent example, visiting us for the first time in the early part of 2020. She is one of our more than 1 million customers who started a backyard flock during the pandemic. And that initial poultry trip led her to buying pet food, clothing and gardening supplies from us. Like many new customers entering the poultry category for the first time, Sarah needed and continues to need trusted advice and expertise regarding her new flock, and we\u2019re providing that. Whether it\u2019s information we\u2019re sharing through our digital channels or our store team members, we believe that our Welcome to Life Out Here marketing campaign and our offering of expert know-how in the Out Here lifestyle is a significant differentiator for us. I do want to point out something very important here. While Tractor Supply is enjoying record highs for attracting new customers, we\u2019re also seeing all-time highs in their basket size. Average sales for new customers in 2021, was up $26 from the prior year, marking an expansion of nearly 40% since 2019. The rich insights we gain from our Neighbor\u2019s Club members also allows us to personalize our messaging in a highly targeted and relevant manner. We can effectively segment our customers based on their interest because we know which categories they shop. Moreover, we know where they live and the local events they are passionate about. This continues to allow us to personalize our messages to each customer based on their specific interest and reasons for shopping Tractor Supply. Our core farm and ranch customer is more likely to receive content regarding livestock and equine feed or bulk pricing on fencing, while our newer customers might receive pet or poultry messaging. We have robust capabilities to target these personalized messages across various marketing channels and at significant scale, in digital advertising, within our mobile app, e-mails, push notifications, social media, text messages and our sizable website. This ability to deliver highly relevant messages to the right customer at the right time has allowed us to build an even stronger relationship with our members. Another major shift we have made to capitalize on our rich and growing customer opportunity is a transition from traditional promotional print marketing to highly targeted and broader reaching, brand building television, streaming and digital support. Early in the pandemic, we expanded our brand marketing to leverage national cable news and digital streaming while also partnering with marquee television properties and high-impact programming that resonates with our customers. It was an approach centered on programs that genuinely support our customers\u2019 passions and Life Out Here, including the wildly popular Yellowstone series, it\u2019s prequel 1883, Professional Bull Riding, NFL Sports and home networks like Discovery and HDTV. Looking ahead to 2022, we plan to lean deeper into this strategy as we have seen it drive the significant increases in key brand awareness metrics. At the beginning of the pandemic, we have recognized that we were one of the best kept secrets in retail for new customers. Then as more new customers shopped with us and became interested in living Life Out Here, we continued to grow awareness with our TV and digital strategies. We know from our customers that our assortment, convenience and know-how are significant reasons that they shop at Tractor, so we highlight these in all of our marketing. And as the metrics show, our expanded and targeted marketing efforts are paying off. Our unaided brand awareness is up 2,100 basis points. Customers considering Tractor for their Life Out Here needs is up 1,000 basis points. And we have seen a 25% increase in our ranking as their favorite retailer of choice. These are remarkable results we are incredibly excited about, particularly as we look to future growth. We are continuing to elevate our brand perception as our customers\u2019 retailer of choice and are well on our way to making Tractor a household name synonymous with Life Out Here. So looking ahead, here is our game plan. First, Tractor Supply is part of a robust, growing and attractive market. We see significant opportunity for durable and sustained growth. Second, our customers are extremely engaged and loyal and return again and again, making us their retailer of choice for Life Out Here. Third, Neighbor\u2019s Club is an industry-leading loyalty program, continuing to grow at a record pace, and is a key differentiator that allows us to drive expansive, continuous growth of our highly engaged customer base. Fourth, we have one of the best marketing technology platforms in the industry, allowing us to customize messages that cultivate loyalty. And last, we will continue our meaningful investments in high-profile, marquee marketing partnerships reinforcing our position with our customers and all of those potential customers that we are synonymous with Life Out Here. I look forward to answering any questions that you may have in our upcoming Q&A session in just a bit. But before we go to John to talk about legendary customer service, let\u2019s hear from one of our customers. [Video Presentation] John Ordus : I love hearing stories like that from our customers. I get a bunch of notes every week from our customers and our team members. I will share another one with you in just a few minutes. But I am excited to talk to you today about something I am very passionate about, taking care of our customers. I believe we have the best customers in retail. And our job is to always live up to their expectations at Tractor Supply enables them to live on their terms. I will walk you through how we are going to lead with legendary service in 2022 and beyond. We are going to talk about our mission, GURA and the Country Mile, our stores, team members and customers, leading with legendary service and our game plan for growth. Our mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices. Our store team members take the words legendary very serious. That means your visit will be the best at any given time in any one of our stores. Our team members are empowered to do whatever it takes to support our customers. Our mission to be legendary is not new to us though. Over my 24 years at Tractor Supply, we have had a dedication to be legendary. We have been on a journey to deliver on this promise to our customers for many years. Looking ahead, this is a significant step-up in our commitment to legendary customer service. We have strong foundational values and the culture, both in the field and at the store support center that puts the customer first in our decision-making. In 2019, we launched our Tractor Way operating model, which continuously optimizes the relationship between task time, customer time, enabling more time for service. Further, we continue to invest and deliver on our omnichannel roadmap to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demand for convenience and our store team members\u2019 ability to execute our new offerings, things like buy online, pick up at store, ship to store, and our drive-thrus. Today, above all things that we do, it\u2019s our team members that make a difference to our customers. When you have a horse, you love talking about your horse. When you weld, you love talking about welding and how to weld. That\u2019s why we hire our customers, they live the Out Here lifestyle and as team members can provide seasoned advice. We have a customer service approach called GURA. GURA is our way of life. It\u2019s our battle cry and it\u2019s how we drive our results. The G in GURA is for greeting. Every customer should be greeted with an open-ended greeting. The U is for uncover. Our team members ask the right questions to better understand exactly what the customer is looking for. For example, the age of your dog, how many acres are you going to be mowing. Once we know what the customer needs, we can move into the R for recommend. Recommend is where the power of the red vest comes in and our team member\u2019s seasoned advice makes a difference. Our customers trust us to give them the best product recommendation. A is for ask, this is where we offer to help the customer load up their purchase or take it to the register for them. And with our mobile POS units, we can ring up our customers anywhere in the store. Our team members know what we value and what we reward. We value people who make commitments and keep them. Our commitments matter and our promise to be legendary is more than just words in our mission and values. We have strategic programs like Hi5 and our Country Mile program that reward desired selling behaviors. Hi5 is all about uncovering and recommending. Our Country Mile program is all about recognition. Whether it\u2019s peer-to-peer, team-to-team or supervisor-to-team, this program is an opportunity for team members to recognize one another for going above and beyond in our commitment to the customer and to each other. Last year alone, we gave over 300,000 Country Mile badges. By rewarding what we value, we have further positioned ourselves as a relationship retailer. Let me give you an example about Jacob, our team member in our Jonesborough, Tennessee store. This is from Jacob\u2019s manager. I had a customer come to me this morning to let me know what a great team member we have in Jake. Last week, the customer went outside about 7 :30 p.m. to find they had a brand-new baby goat. The mother was not allowing it to nurse, so they jumped in their vehicle and drove straight to our store. They barely made it before we closed, but they realized once they were there that they had forgotten their wallets at home. Jake said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201d and paid for everything the customer needed to save the baby goat. The customers came in this morning to pay Jake back and let him know that the baby had survived and was doing well. Jake was taken aback and said he had truly done it out of kindness of his heart. Jake, thank you for demonstrating what true kindness and community is all about. Our customers are special to us at Tractor Supply. I get thousands of positive letters from customers with great experiences inside our stores, just like that one. What our team members do inside our stores every day is making a difference. They love this lifestyle because they live it. Tractor Supply is already really good when it comes to the customer experience, but we are on a journey to being legendary. And being legendary means best in class. We hire for winning attitudes. We are enhancing our training for selling skills and product knowledge. The size of our box allows us to see the customer at any given time and get them out of the store as quick as they would like. We are moving all three of these metrics to be the best. Our Tractor Way operating model is the foundation and will continue to be. Our process efficiency mindset is what allows us to compete on key aspects, like team member knowledge and friendliness, without overinvesting in payroll. Through the Tractor Way, we unlock value for our customers through improved on-shelf availability and more efficient processes that created time for selling. Our field activity support teams are another example of applying the Tractor Way philosophy to remove task work from the stores and make that work more efficient for the teams that are doing it. Our FAST teams are doing an outstanding job and we have seen significant increases in completing tasks on time. By removing this highly variable work from the stores and giving it to the specialized team, we have again provided more time for our store team members to execute GURA. We have spent 2021 adjusting the Tractor Way operating model to reflect the needs of our higher-volume stores. We have also begun to further define roles and responsibilities and related metrics, including that of the sales team versus the operations team versus the FAST team. Expanding on these delineation of roles, we have optimized our scheduling to define when work should get done and what type of work is best done off hours, which allows us to sell during the power hours. We are also working on what other tasks we can take to eliminate, to repurpose, to make sure that we are selling and where an hour of labor investment is best spent. We will measure this operating model through metrics we know work, like GURA, implementing new traffic counters and measuring conversion to better optimize our scheduling capabilities and to identify and coach lost sales opportunities. This is full contact retail. And at Tractor Supply, we believe in belly-to-belly selling. We know that execution of GURA has a direct impact on our customers\u2019 experience, sales and our units per transaction. In fact, when all four steps of GURA are executed, we see an over 15% increase in that transaction. As such, to support our operating model changes, we will heavily focus on improving our training and ability to execute GURA. Our leadership team will champion this program through how we message, what we message and our actions always starting with the customer and the why behind what we are asking. We will begin the shift with the re-launch of GURA at our upcoming leaders meetings and annual sales meetings. Everyone in operations will be talking about the customer experience and GURA. There will be new GURA sales leader scorecards and improved visibility for our district managers. All our communications, meetings, celebrations will be centered around the customer experience and GURA. We will also train to drive confidence in executing GURA. Part of this training will focus on vendor-sponsored product training, selling skills training and product knowledge training. On our team members\u2019 first day, as we tractorize them, they will have enhanced GURA training to make sure we onboard them the right way. And we continue to invest in our district learning centers to make sure our management teams understand how to coach selling. Enable convenience is all about equipping our team members to sell both within the four walls of the store and beyond. Our single integrated team member mobile device is putting all the power and information in the hands of our team. We continue to expand on Theatro capabilities for driving sales and team member efficiency. Our team loves these communication devices, and we are already seeing efficiency and communication improve. We are getting to our customers faster than ever before. We are teaming up cross-functionally to bring the best tools to our team members and customers like things like Wayfinder, conversion metrics and to ask the expert. And we are building upon our current strategy to roll out greenhouses with drive-thrus. Alright. So, here is our game plan for growth and how we are going to lead with legendary service. Our team members provide a differentiated relationship-driven customer experience. Our customers trust our team members\u2019 seasoned advice and product recommendations. Our operating model will be used to create more customer time. We will continue to reduce task and move task work to off-peak hours. New and existing technology will be used to create even more convenience for our customers. Our team members are our number one strategic asset. They are the backbone of this company. We will drive productivity, be more efficient with tasking and service, leverage expenses, continue to invest in our FAST team and we are going to deliver on our commitment to provide legendary customer service to every Tractor Supply customer. We will be best-in-class on customer service. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, John. We will take a moment here for a quick break. When we return, Chief Technology, Digital Commerce and Strategy Officer, Rob Mills, will share details on consumer-facing digital initiatives; Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, Seth Estep, will provide an update on remodeling efforts inside and outside of our stores; and our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Colin Yankee, will share our vigorous efforts to meet strong consumer demand in a challenging supply chain environment. We will see you back in a few minutes. [Video Presentation] Welcome back. A reminder that a Q&A session with members of our executive team is coming up after this round of executive presentations. So, please stay with us. Joining us now to share how investments in our digital platforms are providing better customer experiences is EVP, Chief Technology and Digital Officer, Rob Mills. Rob Mills : Thank you, Mary Winn. I am very excited about being here today to talk about the activities that we will continue to grow our legendary customer experience. It\u2019s great to be here. We have made significant opportunities to continue to grow and capture and build momentum on our digital business we have seen over the past few years. We have accelerated our digital journey, focused on creating a seamless experience regardless of how our customer shops anytime, anywhere, any way. When we introduced our Life Out Here strategy in 2020, this continued to be a focus for Tractor Supply, continuing to advance our ONETractor digital capabilities. Over the past 12 months, we have made significant progress on this journey. The team is living our values every day, driving change, taking initiative and being accountable to the expectations of our customers and our shareholders, introducing new capabilities to enhance our customer interactions, such as curbside pickup and our customer mobile app. We have taken a mobile-first approach in everything we do, using geofencing, which enables store efficiency and enables fast and convenient service for our customers. We have also worked to enrich the customer experience across browse, search and checkout. We are leveraging the rich data from our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program to serve personalized and relevant content to our customers. And we have expanded the ability to purchase from inventory beyond our stores, allowing our customers to buy items that are in transit from our DC to our stores, ensuring that they have access to the products they always need. As you heard Hal mentioned, we continue to grow our online presence, completing our 38th quarter of double-digit growth. Our customers continue to leverage the digital convenience of buy online, pick up in store and curbside pickup. We have seen continued adoption of our customer mobile app as we rolled out capabilities that provide convenience and interaction with our customers. Within 1 year, we have grown 10% of e-commerce sales occurring on the mobile app. We have grown visitors to our website and our mobile app nearly 20% year-over-year and attracted 1.4 million first-time customers through the digital channel. Over the past 12 months, we have driven over 2 million downloads within the mobile app. And even with this digital growth that we have seen, there is still a tremendous opportunity ahead of us compared to other hardlines and specialty retailers. We are definitely the digital leader in the farm and ranch industry. In just 2 years, we have doubled our digital sales, now representing 7% of our total business and have plans continue to grow share to over 15% by 2026, exceeding $2 billion of our total sales. I will share more about our plans for growth today, all of which focuses on the mobile experience that Hal shared earlier. Our customers\u2019 behaviors continue to evolve, embracing convenient ways of shopping and continued preference on mobility. Over 70% of our customer interacts with us on a mobile device, outpacing the industry. And their satisfaction directly ties to the convenience the mobile interaction provides. Our customer satisfaction scores are 500 basis points higher when our customers shop on the mobile app. We will differentiate our digital offering for our customers through the mobile app. For example, we deployed the ability for a customer to request propane refill from the app. This capability simplifies the purchase process, giving the customer the ability to notify a team member that they need assistance with the refill. Through a tap of a button, a team member is notified that the customer is in the parking lot and needs a refill. The team member can acknowledge the request, proceed to the refill station and complete the transaction on a mobile device, making it simple and convenient for the customer. By extending the team member and the customer interactions beyond the store, we are able to improve the customer experience by providing two-way communication, allowing the team member to know and plan for the next customer interaction, which ultimately leads to the legendary customer experience. So, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what\u2019s ahead of us on the digital front. Our activities in 2022 will focus in three primary areas, areas that Hal referenced earlier when he talked about advancing the ONETractor capabilities and that are part of the Life Out Here strategy. First, increasing mobile engagement by creating the best-in-class digital interactions; second, connecting our customers to care for their pets and animals, capitalizing on the strengths in these categories; and third, advancing the omnichannel delivery experience by leveraging conversational commerce. Let\u2019s look at each of these. Our customers tell us through data. They prefer to interact with us through a mobile device. We will continue to increase engagement by providing legendary customer service through frictionless experiences. By using data analytics powered by artificial intelligence, we will drive personalized experiences. And we will continue to differentiate the experience by introducing capabilities that improve the customer interactions and convenience. We will leverage our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program to drive engagement with easy access to program benefits, including rewards and the market, catering to our top-tier customers, providing tools to make their Life Out Here easier. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club power users will easily view reward status, offers and coupons as well as store payment options within a newly redesigned wallet. We will integrate reorder options and introduce Wayfinding to make locating products easier and faster for our customers and our team members. And we will allow customers to obtain on-demand assistance from anywhere in the store or outside the store. The mobile app will drive a personalized experience to our customers, and we will talk to our customers about products and services they need. Using data and analytics, we will offer knowledge to our customer base on their shopping trends, while introducing one-stop shop for all customers\u2019 pet needs within the mobile app. My Pet feature will provide customers with easy access to pet prescriptions, vet services and managing their product subscriptions and scheduling interactions. We will make the experience for the customer, embedding the capabilities into the shopping experience and updating the customer pet profiles based upon their shopping habits and purchase. We will continue to differentiate ourselves by integrating the in-store and digital experience to create a best-in-class omnichannel experience, integrating our digital shopping cart with the in-store cart, allowing checkout on a mobile device or with a team member, introducing one shopping cart regardless of how you shop or this channel you shop in. We will offer our customer connections to our team members from any locations, introducing conversational commerce embedded in the mobile app. This will allow us to provide seasoned advice about their projects, land and animal anytime, anywhere, any way. Providing connections to both the products and services our customers needs for their pets and animals is a part of what enables our ability to deliver legendary service and be the authority for Out Here lifestyle. The My Pet feature, I mentioned will create a one-stop-shop experience for all things related to our customers\u2019 needs for their pets, from prescription medications to reoccurring feed or food needs, offering product subscriptions delivered to their home or set aside for pickup in store, we want to make any item our customer needs easily available, making it convenient and dependable. As the lifestyle leader we have a significant opportunity to continue to widen the gap with our competition in this space. One of the most important parts of the digital interaction is the delivery experience, ensuring that no matter how our customers want their products we exceed their expectations. By continuing to bridge the customer team member experience across the digital lines, we can improve the customer experience and the ability to meet their needs while gaining market share. Let\u2019s look at a quick example. Kelly has placed an online order for curbside pickup. She has purchased several items, including bags of chicken feed and a bag of oyster shell. In Kelly\u2019s customer profile and her mobile app, she has designated a preference to be contacted by a team member in the event a product is unavailable, allowing the team member to suggest a substitution. When Kelly\u2019s order is submitted, a team member in the store receives a notification on his personal communication device that a curbside order is ready to be picked. He picks the chicken feed and then realizes the store doesn\u2019t have the oyster shell she ordered. Mark presses the substitution button on his mobile device and is immediately connected to Kelly via chat. He apologizes for the out of stock and provides her with two similar options, including one of our exclusive brands. Kelly chooses the substitution and Mark completes the order. By keeping our customers and our team members always connected, we can extend the legendary customer service Tractor Supply is known for beyond the four walls of the store. I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us as a company and in the digital business. As you hear from Seth and Colin, you will see the items I have shared support our broader Life Out Here strategy from continuing to evolve the Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program to supporting legendary customer service to how we move product efficiently from our distribution centers to our stores. Each element of the Life Out Here strategy is tied together, ensuring that the work we are doing is focused on supporting the needs of our customers and the Out Here lifestyle, providing a great team member experience and a best-in-class omni-channel experience. The three key highlights I want to leave you with today are : first, we will capture significant market share by creating a best-in-class digital experience; second, we will deploy best-in-breed technology that capitalizes on our unique strength in the pet and animal categories, widening the gap with our competition and we will own the relationship with our customers at all times through conversational commerce, maintaining our position as the Out Here authority. We are uniquely positioned to deliver against the significant digital opportunity we see for Tractor Supply. The Tractor Supply team continues to be excited and passionate about the digital vision and how it is fueling our growth. I am thrilled and proud to continue to be a part of this great organization. Seth, I will hand it over to you. Seth Estep : Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Tractor Supply has been busy making headway with our Life Out Here strategy. In 2020, we outlined initiatives to grow space productivity as a major opportunity to deliver consistent comp store sales. This was a primary goal of our Operate the Tractor Way pillar. When we launched this strategy, we knew we had significant opportunity for improvement in sales per square foot compared to our hardline and specialty retail peers. Since then, we have been focused on our Project Fusion and the Side Lot transformation to drive convenience and to optimize our indoor and outdoor assortment. Importantly, we are making progress and we are driving significant productivity gains. Today, I want to walk you through a local store, updating you on the improvements and how we have continued to evolve our store layout with Fusion and Side Lot, highlighting some of the successes we are seeing as we rollout these strategic initiatives. Let\u2019s get started. Welcome to one of our Tractor Supply stores, where we recently completed a combo Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation remodel. For today\u2019s tour, we are starting outside in our roughly 4,000 square foot garden center. When we first introduced our space productivity initiatives, we highlighted that our most significant opportunity to drive incremental sales, traffic and market share was through our Side Lot Transformation program. In this, we convert a space that\u2019s traditionally been utilized for storage to a garden center that\u2019s tailored to the lifestyle of our Out Here customers. We knew from customer research that the lawn and garden category, specifically live goods and bag products, was the number one hobby of our shopper where they did not look to Tractor Supply as their primary destination. And as the weather turns warmer and we enter spring 2022, we are excited to have more than 160 garden centers to start capitalizing on this opportunity. Our merchants have been aggressively adding growers to prepare for the season. In these garden centers, we will be offering a broad assortment of live goods with a focus on vegetable gardening, shrubs, trees as well as a full assortment of color to create excitement with our customers. Our offering is differentiated for the Out Here lifestyle. We are also introducing additional products in seasonally relevant categories, such as furniture, planners, drilling and outdoor living. From our early reads, we believe that these additions will drive share of wallet with both our core customers and attract new customers to Tractor Supply. From a performance perspective, we are seeing positive lifts in the seasonal department despite very few stores having a garden center in 2021 during the peak season. In our 27 stores where we added only a garden center and did not do a Fusion remodel, we are seeing triple-digit lifts in our live goods and the lift for packaged seeds leaves the chain with strong double-digit lifts on top of triple-digit lifts in 2020. Let\u2019s now shift to the exciting trends of our Fusion and Side Lot combos, particularly the 15 combo stores that were opened for the 2021 spring selling season. In those stores, we are seeing double-digit sales lift performance for the entire store and strong performance across all merchandising divisions. Specific to our seasonal division, which includes our lawn and garden categories, the total seasonal product division lift in these stores is up more than 30% and we are getting incredible feedback from our customers as a shopper updated side lot, in our updated seasonal corner, in our fusion layout. In aisle, we are seeing successes in handheld products, belts, blades and everyday lawn and garden items. Looking ahead to 2022, all garden centers will be built in combination with a Fusion remodel as well as the vast majority of new stores will open with the garden center. As we know, we get the greatest sales lift when we combine our Project Fusion and our Side Lot initiative. These categories are a key focus for Tractor Supply to continue to capture share as identified in our total addressable market opportunities. I hope you share our excitement with our Side Lot Transformation. Now, let\u2019s walk a few of the other areas inside the store and highlight some of the updates and the initial results that we are seeing from our Project Fusion remodels. As you enter the store, our customers immediately experience a dramatic update as they are greeted by the customer service hub, which consolidates our cash registers and customer service desk. Sight lines have also dramatically been improved with the implementation of the new Department Lightboxes. Customer feedback to these changes has been overwhelmingly positive. Our shopper survey results show positive increases in cleanliness, speed needs and checkout and availability of team member assistance. Also, our score for a variety of merchandise in store has improved more than 120 basis points in our Fusion customer survey results. And by moving the customer service desk to the hub, we added approximately 300 square feet of selling space in the center of the store that is more effectively being used to drive space productivity and show additional merchandising programs. So as we move to our pet department, we have reworked adjacencies, updated space allocations and increased the number of pallet positions. One of the biggest changes in our Fusion pet layout is leading the flow of the department with ct products. We know we have significant opportunity to grow sales and share of wallet in cat. And by placing it on the first aisle on Fusion, we are giving greater visibility and access. And when looking at the results, we are excited to see that our Fusion stores are over-indexing in new customer growth in this category. And existing Tractor Supply customers buying in this category is up 600 basis points versus non-Fusion stores. We are also seeing positive sales lifts in wet cat food and supplies across all-time periods post remodel. Since we first introduced you to our Fusion layout, we have also had an additional run of dry dog food in select stores, like you see here, which maximizes holding power and increases space allocations to accelerate growth in this key category. We believe approximately 40% of the Fusion remodels will have the space to add this additional footage in our pet department. We are confident that these changes will continue to drive our market share gains in pet. In addition to pet products, we continue to enhance the services we offer our pet parents, like self-service pet wash stations, which are now in more than 500 locations. In a small subset of stores, we are also piloting wellness centers, which operate in 44 stores to-date with a full-time veterinarian staff 5 days a week. Wellness centers are also complemented with mobile pet vet clinics that operate in more than 1,400 stores today. And in 2021, we serviced over 1.2 million pets through pet wash, wellness centers, pet vet clinics and televet solutions. We will continue to look to grow our pet services as an opportunity to increase customer lifetime value and bring in new customers. In our Fusion stores, we continue to drive space productivity in our livestock feed, health and supplies categories. Just like dog food, these sections, along with the entire pet department, are among the most highly productive areas of the store already. We have updated adjacencies, reallocated square footage and visually improved the department to support this important category. The most significant positive impact is the equine supplement, leg care and fly control categories, which are trending between 400 and 800 basis points above trend. And in select stores, we have added a feed barn that gives the stores the inventory holding power needed to stay in stock and allows customers to drive through and load heavy animal feed, fencing and other core categories directly into their vehicles. These are trip-driving categories where we will win as the 100% dependable supplier. Colin will share more details on how we will widen the gap versus the competition in this key area. Moving into our truck tool and hardware area, this part of the store experienced some of the most significant merchandising updates with the introduction of new brands, new fixtures and significant changes to space allocations. As a result, we are seeing growth in traffic counts, attachment and cross shopping in our power tool department. We see that existing customers are finding and shopping the power tool aisle for the first time. And these customers are much more likely to attach an accessory to the power tool purchase at a Fusion store versus a non-Fusion store. We have also rolled out this tool crowd concept to more than 300 additional non-Fusion stores based on the early results. And what really excites me is that our TAM assessment indicates that these are categories, where we continue to have significant share opportunities. And finally, let\u2019s take a look at our apparel section, which is experiencing the most significant lifts inside the store across all of our Fusion remodel categories. In many remodels, we actually reduced the footprint of the department by consolidating our presentation, with new fixturing and merchandising. In these Fusion stores, apparel is running at comp above 35%, with high single-digit lift as compared to control stores. This is a category that gets an immediate response from the consumer and the lifts have been sustained over time. We believe this is attributed to the visual impact post conversion, updated space allocations of categories and brands as well as the expansion of women\u2019s with brands like Carhartt, Ariat and Wrangler. Apparel is now a key customer mission for people to come to Tractor Supply. We are also excited to showcase brands throughout the department like Carhartt, that you can see here, store within a store concept in 90 locations, which are running departmental comps above company averages. We will continue to look for ways to differentiate our offering in apparel that support our customers\u2019 lifestyles. So thanks for coming along with me on the store tour today. I hope you get the opportunity to get in store yourself and see our new Fusion and Side Lot upgrade soon. I hope you found our store tour insightful today. We believe that investing in our stores is just table stakes to win in today\u2019s omnichannel retail environment. Overall, we are encouraged by the early results we are seeing from our Fusion and Side Lot initiatives, with the biggest impact coming when their innovations have reached a maturity of about 9 months post completion. As we look ahead, our target for Fusion-only stores is a mid-single-digit sales lift post project maturity and we are targeting a high single-digit sales lift on the Fusion and Side Lot combo stores. Our goal is to have 100% of the chain in the Fusion format by the end of 2026, while our combo Fusion and Side Lot stores will ultimately be across 60% to 70% of the chain. We are making significant progress towards our space productivity goals and delivering on the strategic pillar of operate The Tractor Way. We have a best-in-class customer-focused merchant team that will continue to grow sales and profit by driving innovation and optimizing our differentiated merchandising assortment. We are highly focused on capturing market share of our expanded TAM. And we have a compelling game plan for growth that will serve our core customers while bringing in new customers to the Tractor Supply family. All-in-all, we are committed to being the indispensable supplier for Life Out Here and widening the gap versus our competition. Thank you again for going on this Fusion and Side Lot store tour with me today. Next up is Colin, who plays such a key role in serving our customers. With the recent complications to the supply chain, Colin and his team have done an amazing job keeping our stores in stock. Colin Yankee : I really appreciate that, Seth. Thank you so much. It\u2019s great to be here with you to share the transformation that we are on across our supply chain. Tractor Supply is differentiated as the largest retailer for bagged animal feed in the country and the leader in meeting our customers\u2019 needs for poultry, equine, dog and cat food, forge and other C.U.E. or consumable, usable and edible products that are core to living the Out Here lifestyle. Last year, we moved 8 billion pounds of C.U.E. through our supply chain. And as we have grown our sales and market share in C.U.E., our logistics network, our distribution centers and our stores have stepped up to handle that volume and meet the demand. In fact, compared to 2019, last year, the average Tractor Supply store moved 18% more units and 26% more cubic volume of C.U.E. product. And those volumes in total and per store are continuing to grow. We have seen a significant growth in C.U.E. customers because of our product portfolio with breadth across national, local and exclusive brands and products that cover the spectrum of species for all stages of life. We know C.U.E. products are traffic drivers, attracting new and younger customers. We know that customers who shop for C.U.E. at Tractor Supply are some of our most loyal customers, on average making 4x more transactions and shopping across a larger set of categories than a non-C.U.E. customer. And we know how important being in stock and a price leader are to customer satisfaction and retention. With the success of our Fusion and Side Lot remodels and the Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program, the increased volume, velocity and variety of C.U.E. products moving through our supply chain and through our stores presents an opportunity to use our scale and sophistication to widen our leadership position with the C.U.E. customer. While we always take an end-to-end view of our supply chain, the growth we have already experienced and the growth we anticipate in C.U.E. requires a fresh look at the operations, and that\u2019s exactly what we are going to do with our effort to deliver on C.U.E. We are bringing together a powerful new technology with the strength of our distribution center and mixing center network and continuous improvement within our store processes drive more C.U.E. volume through the same-store footprint with maximum efficiency. And we are going to deliver best-in-class on-shelf availability for our customers, whether they shop with us in store, use buy online, pickup in store or we access that inventory to fulfill orders from stores. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our supply chain capacity. We are currently building our ninth distribution center located in Novara, Ohio and we are on track to open that facility later this year. In 2022, we will also start construction on our tenth distribution center, which will be located in Arkansas. We are planning on a facility opening in late 2023 and we will continue to look for locations to best support our operations as we grow the store network, turning our attention next towards distribution points in the Pacific Northwest. To leverage our expanded distribution network with the power of our vendor base, we are deploying a new inventory forecasting and replenishment system in 2022. This new system takes in more data on demand patterns like seasonality and day of the week variations, business decisions like promotions, price changes and changes in display and space and external factors like weather, traffic and local events. Using advanced mathematical techniques and near real-time information, we are creating an even better picture of future demand, supporting higher in-stock rates, with less inventory. The new platform allows us to be more collaborative with our vendors. By sharing information that is fed directly to our vendors\u2019 production planning processes, we can create more accurate orders for these fast-turning products. In our initial test and use cases, the forecast accuracy improvement has lowered total inventory, increased our in-stock rates, driven production efficiencies and improved our response and recovery to changes in demand. We are also deploying new capabilities that allow us to be faster and more responsive inside of our distribution centers. The new replenishment logic allows for high velocity and large C.U.E. products to get picked, loaded and dynamically routed to stores faster and more frequently than we are able to do today and that speed reduces the amount of inventory held in the backrooms. While this new replenishment logic is geared towards our C.U.E. items, we will also strategically apply it to big ticket items, like gun safes and riding lawnmowers, helping us get the right product in the right stores at the right time to optimally use inventory and the store\u2019s capacity. To further support more just-in-time replenishment, we will continue to expand the number and reach of our mixing centers. Mixing centers are rapid replenishment centers designed to deliver the 100 fastest moving C.U.E. items in full pallet quantities. Over the last several years, our mixing centers have proven to reduce the days of inventory coverage required in stores to support sales, relieving pressure on our store backrooms while increasing in-stocks. Today, we operate 12 mixing centers, covering about half of the stores in the chain. And as part delivering on C.U.E., we will service more stores from our existing mixing centers and look to add more mixing center locations to the network over the next several years. Our store teams are agile and they do an incredible job managing the volume and tonnage and the number of deliveries that backup against our store every week. But we are going to give them even greater visibility to that workload. With a new set of visibility dashboards that uses historical data, real-time tracking and predictive analytics, our stores will have greater insight on estimated times of arrival, allowing them to track inbound deliveries from distribution centers, mixing centers and vendors, equipping them to manage tasks and equipment in the store more effectively throughout the day. At the network level, this new visibility provides a rich source of data for analyzing and optimizing inbound workload to inform staffing and operational support for continued optimization efforts. So we are applying new technology and logistics processes to impact product flow, but we are also focused on maximizing efficiency in the stores. In our stores, we are optimizing the backroom layout to reduce the number of touches and the amount of travel our team members need to take while moving product from the trailer to the sales force. For our highest volume or more space-constrained stores, we have seen the success of creating dedicated feed rooms that add pallet drops and storage capacity. By the end of 2022, we anticipate having 160 to 180 feed rooms in our network and we will continue to build out dedicated feed rooms as needed when the store is going through the Fusion and Side Lot remodel process. These layout changes support an increased level of efficiency, building on the existing operating procedures in the store. Because C.U.E. items are the most space and labor-intensive products in our stores, we are focused on new levels of process standardization and engineering in our freight and replenishment tasks. Our stores are adapting staffing models to handle more frequent deliveries, more throughput and faster replenishment to the shelf. By driving greater process engineering and optimizing the backrooms of our stores, we will free up time that can go back to delivering legendary service to our customers. We see the growth in our C.U.E. categories as part of an enduring consumer shift and a central part of our long-term growth plans. To support our long-term sales per store projections, we need solutions to drive more C.U.E., more deliveries and more units through the same-store footprint with greater visibility, predictability and cost efficiency. We are embarking on a multiyear program to optimize the entire C.U.E. supply chain, from the vendor to the store using new technology, logistics processes and store operating procedures. The benefits of these continuous improvement efforts will ultimately drive greater efficiency across the entire assortment, further enhancing the competitive advantage our supply chain provides within farm and ranch space, but importantly, ensuring we are the most dependable supplier for those consumable, usable and edible essentials. Thanks for taking part in the event today. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Mary Winn. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Colin. Before Hal joins us to share his closing thoughts, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Kurt Barton, rejoins us to deliver Tractor Supply\u2019s strategy for robust shareholder returns. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Mary Winn. It\u2019s been 15 months since our October 2020 enhanced earnings event, and I am excited to talk to you again about Tractor Supply\u2019s strategy, our new supporting strategic initiatives and our plan to continue to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. At that time, we outlined our Life Out Here strategy and our focus on TSR. We are pleased with the strong progress that we have made against all elements of the Life Out Here strategy. We have continued to deliver on our highly differentiated proposition as the number one farm and ranch retailer. We have accelerated execution of all our strategic priorities and we have remained disciplined and focused on how we have allocated our capital. This team has worked hard to deliver outstanding financial results and are honored that our shareholders have benefited from the S&P 500 top decile TSR that we have delivered over the last 2 years. Despite our strong progress, we are not resting on our laurels. We continue to add important new strengths to reinforce our focus on delivering strong and sustainable TSR. Our top line revenue growth is compelling, not only in magnitude, but also in its quality and durability. The Life Out Here strategy continues to expand and we have added new strategic initiatives. As you heard from John, we plan to lead with legendary service and aim to achieve that number one position in customer experience. And as you heard from Rob, we are deeply focused on digital as part of our omni-channel approach and intend to dramatically lift our mobile engagement. And as you heard from Colin, we are investing in our supply chain to support the growth in key products that are core to living the Out Here lifestyle. We are proud that our strong and durable free cash flow enables the Power of AND ensuring that we can fully support and fund all of our most important growth investments and return significant capital to shareholders at the same time. The growth that Tractor Supply has generated over the past 2 years is highly differentiated within retail and is firing on all cylinders. Rarely can a retailer founded more than 80 years ago demonstrate the magnitude, diversity and quality of growth that Tractor Supply has delivered over the past 2 years. Almost one-third of our growth came from new customers and over two-thirds has come from increasing share of wallet with our passionate and loyal existing customers. The volume and basket growth that we have delivered has meaningfully exceeded any top line tailwinds that we have seen from inflation. Our e-commerce growth continues to accelerate with 2-year CAGR of 80% in our digital channel, forming a larger part of our growth that we have ever seen before and new and expanding categories in lawn and garden, grilling, apparel, power tools and pet drove almost one-third of our comp growth, along with strong increases in our core businesses such as C.U.E. The diverse mix of growth that we have seen highlights the underlying strength of Tractor Supply\u2019s top line organic growth. This gives us deep confidence in the strength and quality of our growth trajectory. As we look to the future, we expect to deliver a high-quality and sustainable top line organic growth trajectory that builds on the substantially higher revenue base that we have achieved in the last 2 years. Our long-term financial outlook includes a revenue growth of 6% to 7%, with a 4% to 5% contribution from comps and 2% contribution from new store openings. Our 4% to 5% comps outlook is underpinned by growth in customer demand from our loyal customer base and new customer growth. Expansion of our TAM through the new and expanded categories I mentioned earlier, such as lawn and garden, grilling and pets and continued execution of our Life Out Here strategy, with key roles being played by the lift in store productivity from Fusion and Side Lot, our goal of being the number one legendary customer experience and our strong focus on customer retention and further engagement through our powerful Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program. We are pleased that our most recent market analysis has indicated that we have more new store growth headroom than we shared with you in the fall of 2020. And as a result, we are increasing our total store target by 200 to 2,700 stores. Our target of 2,700 stores will be achieved organically. We are excited that with this increased target we will have a decade of future growth runway in non-comps growth ahead. As Hal mentioned, we remain optimistic about the FTC process regarding Orscheln, which would be additive to our total store target of 2,700. Given our recent performance, increased scale and greater line of sight into some of our most important cost drivers, we are raising our long-term operating margin target to a range of 10.1% to 10.6%. Since initially providing this guidance in the fall of 2020, we have gained greater line of sight into the operating margin drivers that you see on the left side of this page. As a result, we believe we can sustain an operating margin above 10% and feel that there is upside margin potential beyond last year\u2019s operating margin of 10.3%. We have seen favorable impacts from pricing and promotion, expansion of our product mix, our operating efficiency program and the improved operating leverage generated from our high-quality growth. Despite the headwinds from inflation, higher transportation costs as well as maintaining the significant investment programs we have underway, we see our current margin levels in the 10.1% to 10.6% range as sustainable longer term. As I mentioned earlier, our operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2022 is in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%. And from this, you can infer that over the next 5 years, we feel that we have the opportunity at least to maintain and potentially grow margins towards the top of that range. In addition to the operating margin outlook range, we believe there are other opportunities that while uncertain provide the potential for further margin upside if they progress favorably. These include the normalization of investment levels to sustain our growth trajectory, lower transportation and COVID-related costs and reduced inflationary pressures such as wages. We have made enormous progress in the execution of our Life Out Here strategy. The rollout of our two key store remodeling programs, Fusion and Side Lot has accelerated. As Seth shared with you, our expectation for Fusion-only stores is a mid single-digit sales lift post-project maturity and a high single-digit sales lift on the Fusion and Side Lot combo stores. By end of 2026, we are targeting 100% of our stores to have the completed Fusion remodel and 60% to 70% of our stores base to have the new Side Lot with garden center. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program is seeing very strong growth and helping us provide even greater value and engagement with our deeply loyal Life Out Here customers. As Christi mentioned, our Neighbor\u2019s Club members remain one of our most valuable assets, driving approximately 70% of total sales and spending 3x more than non-loyalty customers. Our e-commerce performance has been fantastic, delivering 80% annual growth in sales over the past 2 years. Our mobile app just launched late 2020, already makes up 10% of our digital sales revenue. We are excited to target a digital penetration of approximately 15% and over $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026 and we will continue to invest behind and strengthen our digital capabilities. We continue to focus on our disciplined capital allocation with a clear set of priorities and how we think about optimal capital allocation to support the delivery of strong and sustainable TSR. Investing in the business to drive organic growth remains our number one priority with the clear ambition of sustaining our high-quality growth trajectory long-term. We remain committed to outstanding return of capital to our shareholders, firstly, through our growing dividend at least as fast as earnings and secondly, by returning excess cash through a strong and consistent share repurchase program. Where appropriate, we will pursue tuck-in acquisitions to add to our growth and key capabilities for the future. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. This compelling free cash flow that we expect to generate over the next 5 years, which includes a cumulative $8 billion of operating cash flow, $5 billion of free cash flow puts us in a very attractive position and enables the Power of AND. The strength and durability of our future cash flow delivery means that we can fully fund all of our growth oriented, high return initiatives and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders simultaneously. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $3 billion in CapEx, in Fusion and Side Lot distribution centers, technology and customer experience with the objective of delivering our long-term growth ambition. While organic growth investments are our highest priority, the strong and growing free cash flow enables us to remain fully committed to our capital return. In our October 2020 enhanced earnings call, I indicated that our 5-year return of capital to shareholders would be approximately $4 billion. Based on the expectation of our stronger cash flow generation and our updated long-term financial outlook, we now expect to return more than $6 billion in capital over the next 5 years. This return of capital is expected to exceed our free cash flow by utilizing existing cash on the balance sheet and modestly increasing our leverage, ensuring we are putting every dollar of cash and cash flow to use. As announced in our earnings release today, we will significantly increase our quarterly dividend by 77% to $0.92 per share. This level will approximately equate to a target 40% payout ratio as a percent of net income. Moving forward, we plan to grow our dividend per share at a rate that is equal to or greater than our earnings per share over the next 5 years. It is important to note that future quarterly dividends are subject to Board of Directors discretion and approval. This dividend increase and future growth highlights our strong commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our confidence in Tractor Supply\u2019s trajectory. Now, we also remain committed to a consistent share repurchase program and our increased dividend should not be seen as being at the expense of our share repurchase program, but reinforcing the Power of AND. Let\u2019s now look at our long-term financial outlook. When comparing back to our 2019 long-term outlook, we have pulled forward 6 years of targeted growth into the past 2 years. We expect to build from our stronger revenue base and deliver 4% to 5% comps, 6% to 7% total sales on average over the next 5 years based on the solid evidence of the success of our Life Out Here strategy and the structural shifts in our markets as you heard from the team today. As I mentioned earlier, our greater line of sight into the cost drivers has enabled us to lift our long-term operating margin outlook from 10.1% to 10.6% range. This means that our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent share repurchase program will enable us to deliver an 8% to 11% earnings per share growth over the next 5 years. Pulling this strong financial outlook together highlights Tractor Supply\u2019s long-term, double-digit TSR delivery potential. This double-digit TSR potential includes 8% to 11% EPS growth and an approximate 1.5% current dividend yield with further room to grow relative to earnings. Beyond this double-digit TSR, we see further potential upside that can be achieved by accelerating strategic initiatives and executing on tuck-in acquisitions. As I wrap up, I would like to leave you with some final thoughts. The strong finance performance and outlook I have talked through with you today is reflective of our success with our customers. The tireless and dedicated work of all of Tractor Supply\u2019s team, combined with the deep and growing loyalty of our customers is what makes Tractor Supply the company that it is. Building on my statements at our last enhanced earnings event, whether I look at our strong and sustainable growth outlook, the operating margin potential, the Power of AND and our double-digit TSR potential, in my 22 years at Tractor Supply, I cannot recall a time in which I have been more proud and excited about the future of the company. And I hope you all feel the same way. With that, I will turn it back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. We appreciate everyone in the audience spending the last couple of hours with us. As we transition to Q&A, I hope you found compelling the updates we shared with you today. Kind of a quick summary of the incremental news we discussed. One, we are capitalizing the many macro structural benefits such as rural revitalization, self-reliance, home steady and pet ownership and we are investing in our capabilities like digital and loyalty to continue to widen our moat with the competition. Two, we provided an update to our long-term financial outlook that includes raising our operating margin to 10.1% to 10.6%. Three, we operate in a large, attractive and fragmented growing market that we now estimate to be $180 billion. Four, with our growing total addressable market and the vibrancy of our trade areas, we now see the opportunity for an additional 200 Tractor Supply stores, bringing our total store opportunity to 2,700 locations. Five, we had the financial flexibility to invest in our Life Out Here strategy and return capital to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced our Board\u2019s approval to increase our quarterly dividend by 77% and an additional share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. Tractor Supply has a deep history and a track record of success. We are coming off a record 2 years. We have compelling opportunities for continued growth and the team to execute. The future tomorrow is bright for Tractor Supply. Thank you. Now we\u2019ll take a 5-minute break before we go to the Q&A segment. See you in a minute. [Video Presentation] A - Mary Winn Pilkington : Welcome back to the Q&A session of Tractor Supply\u2019s enhanced earnings event. We have assembled all of today\u2019s presenters and they are ready to take your questions. A couple of housekeeping notes first. Please limit your question to one per call with a clarifying follow-up only if necessary. We have been very proactive in trying to show plenty \u2013 and allow plenty of time for this Q&A session, so you are welcome to get back in the queue to ask any additional questions if time allows. For anyone just tuning in, a quick introduction of our team, President and CEO, Hal Lawton; CFO, Kurt Barton; Christi Korzekwa, SVP of Marketing; John Ordus, Chief Stores Officer; Rob Mills, Chief Technology, Digital Commerce and Strategy Officer; Seth Estep, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Colin Yankee, Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have a line of folks already standing by. So, let\u2019s take our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Kate. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Nice to see everyone. Our question is centered around the operating margin opportunity. So I guess this question is for Kurt. We wondered about the cadence of the operating margin expansion over the next 5 years. Is it fairly even each year? And what is the biggest difference in this outlook versus what you gave us in October when it was a 9% to 9.5% range? I am just thinking that since the last time we spoke with you, transportation and labor is higher, while the top line outlook is staying the same? Kurt Barton : Yes, hey, good morning Kate and thank you for the questions. On operating margin, as you think about the long-term targets, one, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the business. And the last 15 months have really shown in regards to is it structural, is it transitory in regards to the performance of the company, a lot more visibility and confidence in the structural nature of our business. And really that was one of the key factors when you look back to our enhanced earnings event 15 months ago. So, what we have seen first from the top line is that the belief in the structural nature of that really gives us the confidence on the SG&A that you have got that leverage. In regards to your question about how the cadence and what are some of the factors? I\u2019ll break it down between gross margin and SG&A and over time. So with gross margin, certainly, we recognize right now we are in unprecedented inflationary times, managing that really well. We expect that inflation, as I mentioned, our 2022 guidance, to persist in over the next few years we expect a general inflationary environment, but more typical modest inflation and we believe we can manage that through our scale and through our retail price management. Transportation and the supply chain disruptions, we believe those maybe a little bit longer in nature and it might take a few more years to be able to actually normalize on it. But in the back end of that timeframe some of that transportation easing and normalization. In addition to that, on the SG&A side, we look at it in our investments right now we are hitting some of the peak investments. We understand that those investments put pressure on the SG&A and it\u2019s the right thing for the long-term, along with investment in wages. So, the next couple of years have a stronger pressure in operating margin, but when you take the easing on the gross margin pressures of inflation, when you think about us beginning to have traction on the investments and our ability to drive efficiencies. I\u2019ll even mention really proud about our profit improvement, our operating efficiency programs that we\u2019ve got. We believe those are key drivers along with leverage from scale that allows us to be able to invest for the long-term, grow the top line. And during this time of investment, where you heard from Seth, really transforming many of our stores that we can do that while maintaining and potentially even grow our operating margin in the next 5 years. So it again, will be a little bit of easing into that. And maybe perhaps in the back end of it is more the upside of it, but we like that algorithm and the excitement that having an operating margin above 10% with phenomenal growth. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you. All right and our next question will come from Peter Benedict with Baird. Good afternoon. I guess, your time Peter. Nice to see you think morning. Peter Benedict : Hi, Mary Winn, yes, nice to see you all. Congratulations. Great event today. I guess maybe I just wanted to ask one about the cadence around Fusion and Side Lot, the rollouts there. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about how you see that over the next few years, how you gave some guidance on \u201822. Maybe something on the cost and the time to complete there is Side Lot tougher to get done here with some of the supply chain issues out there. And then maybe just an updated view on your Lawn and Garden TAM, what are you really going after here with Side Lot, and what type of share do you think you guys can get within those incremental categories over the next few years? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hey, Peter, and thanks for joining us today. I appreciate your question. If we look backwards last year, I just can\u2019t say enough about the fortitude and grit determination of the team to get 80 new stores open, to have 300-plus Fusion stores and over 150 Side Lot stores. And as you mentioned, given all the disruption from COVID is related permitting and construction crews and the availability of things like fixtures and other materials. To be able to still achieve our goals from the beginning of the year, it\u2019s just a real tribute to that team. In light of those issues, which we expect to persist for all of this year, we kind of kept our cadence for this year, similar to last year, as we talked about a couple of hundred Fusion stores, around 150 side lot stores and again, another 80 new store. And then if you kind of \u2013 all of our new stores also will be done with Fusion and many of our new stores also have garden centers. And then if you kind of take the balance, it will be really equally spread over the remaining 4 years as we lead to 2026, and that does assume a slight step-up in annual cadence from \u201823 and beyond. On the returns, we are very \u2013 continue to be very pleased with the returns of both Fusion and Side Lot. As we shared on our last earnings call, the Fusion-only stores are running in that kind of mid-single-digit comp once they get kind of the 12-month kind of cycle, maturity cycle. And then our combo stores are right at that kind of high single-digit comp. We\u2019re very excited that we\u2019ve got about 150 stores in our Side Lot combos that will be hitting that 12-month mark right around the time spring hit. So it\u2019s going to be a great opportunity for us to drive some sales and drive some share with those fresh stores. On the TAM, we talked about in my presentation about adding $40 billion to our TAM. And that is dominantly lawn and gardening, kind of live goods. And it\u2019s a fresh category for us, and one we think is a great opportunity. Our customers qualitatively, as we talked about, I talked about it being the number one category that they participate in that we least serve them in. And we\u2019re seeing great results as we talked about in the first cohort of stores. On the cost, it\u2019s hard to get each individual store because there is so much nuance depending on the setup of the store and the age of the store. But toughly, the way to think about it is we took our capital from $300 million to $600 million, roughly. About $100 million of that is supply chain with little technology. That leaves about a couple of hundred million left that involves our store investments. And then if you take the kind of 350 combo Fusion, Side Lot stores this year, you can kind of divide those into each other and get a sense. The range is anywhere from $0.5 million to $1 million a store that really just depending upon the nuances around that store. But again, really pleased with the return we\u2019re getting strong return on investment capital it\u2019s hitting all of our business cases. And as I said, we\u2019re really excited about having over 150 Side Lot stores open for business when we hit the spring garden season. Peter Benedict : That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much, guys. Mary Winn Pilkington : And our next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Hey, Zach. Zach Fadem : Hey, thanks for taking the question. And thanks for all the great data today. So following up on the last question, you noted that combo stores with Fusion and Side Lot are seeing high single-digit lift in year 1, which alone looks like about a 100 to 200 basis point comp lift per year through 2026. So first of all, it sounds like the early 2021 cohorts performed closer to a double-digit lift. So I just wanted to confirm that. And then curious if you have any thoughts on what those stores could in year 2 and beyond and whether they will continue to outcomp the fleet or fall back more in line with the broader company average. Hal Lawton : Hey. Zach, and I appreciate your question, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019d say two things. First off, kind of to clarify, high single-digit I think is kind of what we\u2019re on the record right now, around the 12-month mark for the combo stores. As it relates to the impact on comp, I think that\u2019s around \u2013 that\u2019s roughly right. You take, call it, 9%, 10% lift on kind of 10% of the store base annually. And do the math, and that\u2019s about what the contribution should be. That\u2019s certainly baked guidance. And as Kurt said, it\u2019s the thing that really gives us confidence in our guidance. And the last time we did an investor enhanced earnings call was in October 2020, we\u2019re roughly 35%, 40% bigger in revenue, right, larger revenues from that date. And yet we\u2019re still holding to our 4% to 5% long-term comp growth and 6% to 7% revenue growth. And it is because of the investments we\u2019re making in the Side Lot and in Fusion and there are other areas that we\u2019re confident they are really going to go after that growth and drive those sales and that we can do that mid-single-digit comp on top of revenue growth of over 50% in the last 2 years. And as we said, again, we\u2019re very excited about having well over 150 Side Lot stores business here in the spring season, and we\u2019re getting even a better read on the impact that it can have on our business. Zach Fadem : Thanks so much. Really appreciate the time today. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Zach. Mary Winn Pilkington : And our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Hi, Peter. Peter Keith : Hi, thanks, everyone. Good to see you and a terrific presentation today. I wanted to dig into some of the gross margin discussion. I think in thinking about the forward gross margin drivers, product mix was mentioned as a positive driver. That kind of goes counter to what we seen historically with the business, with the growth in C.U.E. I would think that product mix could also be hindered by the garden center expansion. So maybe you could unpack that a little bit on how you feel about product mix and what categories do you think can drive that positive shift? And then furthermore, just thinking about the other positive drivers to gross margin, pricing and promotions, there might be some skepticism on lower promotions, because there hasn\u2019t been lot of promotions in the last 2 years? So maybe you could unpack how you\u2019re thinking about delivering margin expansion on those, too? Seth Estep : Hey, thanks, Peter, this is Seth. Great question. Good to see you today. And when we look at gross margin as we manage forward, I would say if you look where we were historically, when we\u2019ve talked about C.U.E. outpacing the fleet now potentially could put a little bit of pressure on the company. What I would say today is that the balance of the four walls is really performing. So while C.U.E. is outpacing, we\u2019re continuing to premiumize even our C.U.E., we\u2019re pushing people, call it, into that premium segment. But outside of that, we\u2019re also seeing the apparel segment do really well for us today, right? We\u2019re seeing our truck and toy area is doing really well for us today. I could go around the four walls of the store, and we look at our sales forecast and we look at particularly, this upcoming year, we\u2019re anticipating all four walls continue to contribute to that sales number and that estimate that we have out there. So while C.U.E. is continuing to outperform, we\u2019re looking to continue to drive that C.U.E., drive those footsteps, coupled with the balance of the store, along with our pricing technology that we have today, which is much more sophisticated than we continue to have in the past. We feel confident in the ability to be able to look at the pressures that are coming in the business, manage the mix of the product and be able to deliver those gross margin targets that we have out there. Peter Keith : Okay, thanks so much, guys. Good luck. Mary Winn Pilkington : And our next question comes from Steve Forbes at Guggenheim. Steve Forbes : Good afternoon, everybody. Hal Lawton : Hi, Steve. Steve Forbes : I wanted to focus on e-commerce and digital growth. So Hal or Rob, you mentioned 15% penetration by 2026, which is a, I think, about a mid \u201820 CAGR in the next couple of years. So can you comment on how the average customer engages with this channel? The profitability of this channel, how that\u2019s evolved? And whether your initiatives behind this channel has increased the average numbers of transactions that you\u2019re seeing within all customer cohorts? Hal Lawton : Yes. Absolutely, Steve. Thanks for your question. And I\u2019ll pass it over to Rob to address that. I appreciate it. Rob Mills : Good morning, Steve. Great to see you, and thank you for the question. So in regards to the customer and the customer interaction, they are definitely engaging with from a digital perspective. And as you heard through my presentation, the focus around mobility first is very key as well as leveraging the power of the data that we have with Neighbor\u2019s Club. We have seen tremendous growth. We are extremely confident with that penetration rate. And we\u2019re holding in to really drive a personalized experience with that customer, telling what they need for the product, their services and just really simply, how do you remove any of the friction and really driving that convenience. From ability perspective, we\u2019re profitable. We deliver contributions back to Tractor Supply. We have a profitable online business. We will continue, of course, to look at profitability, ways to improve the profitability, leveraging all the great work that\u2019s being driven through either the analytics and understanding of our business through the product assortment mix as well as the work that\u2019s being done and can\u2019t see him. We look at the store as our primary hub, how do we fulfill from this store? Same day delivery, delivering from the store capability as well as buy online pickup as well as curbside pickup, which has been a tremendous growth opportunity. Lastly, I shared some core capabilities that we\u2019re focusing on. And going back to the mobile piece, it is around how we\u2019re putting mobile first. We\u2019re using the power of the Neighbor\u2019s Club and that analytics and knowing that customer to ensure that we\u2019re always connected with that customer at all times. When they are researching items so you are leveraging as the expert, so all the way through the ordering process, when you\u2019re actually fulfilling that customer order and how do you drive that connection back to the store, the store hub and being connected back to that team member. So we\u2019re providing that knowledge, that trust and the authority that our customer trusted. And so I guess I\u2019ll leave you with that. We have a clear road map, a strategy to move forward, both how we\u2019re engaging to the customer. We listen to the customer. We leverage the data and we\u2019re as well as we will continue to focus on the profitability, but we\u2019re strong and we\u2019re ready. Steve Forbes : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks, Steve. And our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli at Truist. Hey, Scot. Nice to see you. Scot Ciccarelli : Thanks a lot, Mary Winn, good to see you as well. So my question has to do with the new customers. Obviously, new customers have been a significant source of growth for the last 2 years. And I think we can kind of all get our heads around kind of 2020 patterns, people moved away from urban centers. But I guess my question is, when you look at your cohort \u2013 the new customer cohort from \u201821, is it the same kind of cause and effect? Or is this a new customer acquired because some of the changes that Tractor Supply has been able to institute over the last few years? Hal Lawton : Yes, hey, Scott. Thanks so much for the question today. I appreciate you joining us for the event. And I\u2019ll toss it over to Christi to talk about our new customers and the customer insights for seeing. Christi Korzekwa : Hi, Scott, thanks for the question. I\u2019m looking forward to talking to you about our new customers. You\u2019re right. I mean, we\u2019ve had record growth in 2020 during the pandemic of new customers, but that really didn\u2019t wane during 2021. We saw a very similar, if not even a larger pre-pandemic number in 2021. So those customers are coming back to us, are coming to us even in 2021. We see that, that has a lot to do with those structural changes that are happening in \u2013 with the pandemic relative to rural revitalization and more millennials moving in from urban to suburban, ex-urban and rural areas. And what we\u2019re finding is that 30% of our sales are coming from these new customers. So we feel incredibly positive about growth of the new customer, and it will continue. A lot of that given to the structural nature of our business, need space. They are moving into our trade areas, our Tractor Supply neighborhoods. They are buying homes there. They are starting garden, they are starting flocks, pet adoptions at record highs. So, just incredibly optimistic that our runway is still far from at an end and certainly, we identified 40 million customers that we can still talk to that should be shopping us that are within our trade areas, so just lot of momentum and a lot of power behind those new customers just excited about it. Scot Ciccarelli : So just to clarify, if I might, so this isn\u2019t because you guys have expanded garden and live goods, this is just the customer migration towards kind of your areas and regions, which is what\u2019s driven it? Christi Korzekwa : I would say it\u2019s a combination of many things. I would say it is certainly the fact that we have a lot of customers moving into our trade areas. It\u2019s because we have our individuals maturing into the lifestyle. I would say it\u2019s because of our merchandising mix, I would say it\u2019s because of the trends and the work from home. So there is many factors that are attributing to the growth, certainly glad that we have a lot of runway with the 40 million customers that \u2013 or should be shopping us in our trade areas that we are going to be attracting over the next years to come. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you very much. Christi Korzekwa : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Hi, Simeon. Nice to see you. Simeon Gutman : How are you doing? I look funny on camera. I wanted to go at Kurt, a follow-up to the question that Kate asked you about operating margin. If you look at your business in 2021 versus 2019, your sales per store were up just over 40% and your SG&A per store were up about 39%. So you spent into all of your growth, and that\u2019s about the tightest spreads you get across all of the companies we follow. So if your business continues to grow at 4% to 5% comps and new compound going forward, and your investment cycle is going to peak. Unless your SG&A continues for your gross margin comes down, it would seem like there is a lot of upward pressure on your EBIT margin way past the numbers you guided today. So what\u2019s wrong with that logic? Kurt Barton : Simeon, yes, thank you for the question. I think it\u2019s a great one. And this team is basically focused on managing our operating margin overall. Here\u2019s a couple of the things that in regards to over the next 3 to 5 years. You pointed out the investments that we\u2019re making on the business. When we look at our operating margin, we look at what we\u2019re doing to invest from a position of strength and for the future. We\u2019re making key investments in the SG&A, and we\u2019re making investments in our supply chain. And those investments in the supply chain will help drive the market share and the sales that will help drive gross margin. We\u2019re making investments field activity support team. We\u2019re making investments in our IT technology. So we\u2019re making the right investments, and yes, that puts some pressure on the SG&A, but our focus on driving market share for the long-term and the ability to be able to enhance that gross margin, it\u2019s going to differ between the years. But we\u2019re going to be really focused on top line being competitive and getting a good price to our customer and maintaining a good operating margin and keeping that even balanced. I\u2019ve mentioned in my presentation, I put in that slide that we recognize there is some uncertainties in the financial algorithm today, unprecedented inflation. We\u2019re seeing wage inflation and make sure that we\u2019re positioned again to invest in our stores, in our technology by doing all of those things along with just having COVID expenses still in the business like most of retail. All of those costs we have some expectations continue to play into the financial algorithm, and there is opportunity. We want to be careful. We want to be prudent in our operating margin. And we feel like some of those factors turn positive in the long-term, that does give us the opportunity for that while we\u2019re being pretty prudent in that approach and making sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing for the business and real steady throughout these 5 years. Simeon Gutman : Thank you, everyone. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Simeon. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks, Simeon. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Hey, Michael. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Your guidance for this year assumes that you\u2019re going to get 400 basis points of an inflation contribution. You also mentioned you expect traffic to be up. So let\u2019s assume that\u2019s going to be up 50 basis you the high end of your comp range. You also mentioned that you expect big ticket to be under pressure this year. Presumably, your core customer also saw an extraordinary amount of government support from stimulus, enhanced unemployment and child tax payments last year. How have you factored that into your guidance for this year? And as a follow-up, and a quick clarifying, after we get through fiscal supply chain disruption, what\u2019s the prospect for some potential deflation in your categories? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Michael, and tanks for the question. I mean I think the math you provided is really kind of the math that our guidance reflect is about four points of inflation in the year that will drive ticket up, kind of a give back on ticket of a couple of points because of stimulus due to last year\u2019s kind of surge in big ticket, kind of netting to a couple of points. And then the balance of our comp range made up of comp transactions to kind of get there, so in kind of that 1% to 2% range on the comp transactions. And we feel very good about that formula. And we\u2019re committed to unit growth, and we\u2019re committed to comp transaction growth this year. And we gained substantial share over the past years we talked about. We think there is a big opportunity to continue to do that. And then on deflation, I think there is a likely \u2013 there is \u2013 that\u2019s always out there. I think it\u2019s really unlikely for the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons. Dominantly that the majority of the inflation we\u2019ve seen is, I think, structural in terms of the new levels that we\u2019re at, whether that\u2019s wages, many of the cost of goods, freight, imports. I think we\u2019re going to see a kind of a structural holding of a lot of those costs. I don\u2019t know they will continue to see inflation, but I don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to see significant deflation on that certainly in the next 18, 24 months or so. And the other thing I\u2019d say is our past cycle on inflation, it\u2019s been really kind of the core commodities that drove it. And here, it\u2019s really across the board. I mean, we\u2019re seeing cost of goods increases due to wages, cost of goods due to steel, cost of goods due at other raw materials and our manufacturers\u2019 wages. So I think it\u2019s more structural in nature. The final thing I would leave is we lot more sophistication around our pricing tools and our competitive pricing engines that we had before. And so we\u2019re just a lot more sophisticated in the way we can navigate through that. But regardless of how the environment evolves, I think we\u2019ve shown our ability to be flexible, agile, deliberate performance, stay priced in the market, continue to gain share and deliver results, and that\u2019s our commitment, whether it\u2019s an inflationary environment or a deflationary environment. Michael Lasser : Thank you and good luck. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks, Michael. Our next question is going to come from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Hey, Chris, how are you? Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good afternoon, thank you for the presentation. So a bit of a follow-up question to Michael. So as you think about elasticity and inflation, you saw some headwinds to gross margin rate from product cost inflation. Is that simply you managing the business from a gross profit dollar perspective versus not a gross margin rate perspective? And then similarly, on the macro side, as you think about your potential sensitivity to wealth effect and higher rates in housing, have you taken any of that into account considering your expectation for continued ruralization? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Chris and good to speak with you today. And I\u2019d say, first off, on pricing. I think the team has done a fantastic job navigating the cost environment, finding offsets to many of the inflation factors and productivity and efficiency. Also being that advocate for the customer on price and making sure we\u2019re staying price right every single day. And then where we have found it necessary and needed to, we have passed through price. I mean, to the tune of 7% price inflation in Q3 and 8.5% price inflation in Q4. I think our guidance as we talked about a 4% inflation for 2022 reflects kind of the higher single-digit price inflation through the first half starting to cycle that and settle back into low single digits in the second half. If you look at all the puts and takes, I think there is more risk to the upside on our inflation assumption than there is to the downside. But the team will continue to navigate, navigate through that as we go forward. And remind me, Chris, the second part of the question? Chris Horvers : So as you think about \u2013 clearly, you\u2019ve had a strong wealth effect for the consumer low rates, house price increases, stock market benefit. Surely, that\u2019s had some impact to your consumer and the sort of ruralization that you\u2019ve seen as people sort of spend more time in rural homes. So have you taken any potential headwinds into account from rates moving up and decelerating the housing and wealth engine? Hal Lawton : Yes. It\u2019s something we certainly watch closely. Christi and the team have a number of ways that they monitor the health of our customer, whether it\u2019s quantitative and qualitative. I\u2019d say, right now, the home market is really strong, right? There is less than 1 million homes that are available on the market around, I think, 900,000 last month, 1.6 million, 1.7 million new homes being built right now on an annualized basis. existing home sales, well above $6 million. I think that\u2019s going to continue for really the next couple of years at a minimum, even in spite of interest rates and even likely in spite of \u2013 within reason, home prices. You just got a millennial generation that\u2019s now wanting to purchase homes. And I think in general, that\u2019s good for us. When people buy homes or transact around homes, it creates projects. It\u2019s a big project starter, and we see that in our business. And I think it\u2019s going to continue on. The consumer still has over $2 trillion of pent-up savings. I think the last month or 2, if you look at the data, they have started to tap into that a little bit. But there is runway certainly for the balance of this year as they draw down, so to speak, on those pent-up savings to drive the GDP growth that I think is being forecasted really across the country. And I think rural customers have navigated this environment better than the average kind of a consumer out there. And I think we\u2019re in a very favorable market as we head into 2022. Thanks so much, Chris for your questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks, Chris. And up next is Scott Mushkin with R5. Hey, Scott, how are you, today? Scott Mushkin : Hi, Mary Winn. How are you guys doing? Thanks for having me on and thanks for conducting. This is great. So I wanted to actually attack the revenue side of things, your revenue growth algorithm. It seems to me if you look over the next several years. And I think you guys said it right, like you kind of only just begun to make these changes. I mean, clearly, Lawn and Garden is an adjacent category, but there is a lot more where as you guys transition into the more kind of lifestyle superstore. It seems like there is a lot of other categories you could get into become bigger and some are available online. So I wanted to ask you about that. I also wanted to ask about the making store more experiential. We have the check based and stuff like that, but it\u2019s obviously more you can do that way. And then finally on services, again, another enormous opportunity for the company to layer in additional services and so there is a lot here. And do you guys have a speed to attack all this, and it seems like revenue growth could actually come in significantly higher? Hal Lawton : Hey, Scott, thanks so much of the question. And I think we\u2019re going to break that up into two parts with Seth, can you maybe talk a little bit about the assortment and how we\u2019re evolving and much of that he shared in the video and kind of recap some of that. And then maybe John can talk a little bit about the experiences in our stores, whether it\u2019s chip days, pet watches, clinics and many of the other things, the 4-H and FFA type stuff that we do. But Seth, you want to hit the assortment expansion first? Seth Estep : Yes, absolutely. Hey, Scott, great to see you. Thanks for the question. I\u2019m incredibly excited about exactly what you\u2019re talking about and how I outlined earlier our expansion of our total addressable market. And from a merchandising perspective, that\u2019s what really, really excites us because we know we have opportunities across our business as we\u2019re seeing both our core shopper and these new shoppers that are finding Tractor Supply as we\u2019re introducing them to this lifestyle. They are finding the buying and where we know we have that considerable market share opportunity. Our merchants are continuing to attack that with partnerships, exclusivity, going after differentiation, driving experiences in the store that John will talk both inside the box, but also looking at outside the box. Obviously, with what we\u2019re looking garden centers, our front aprons could go on and on. And so we\u2019re looking at this year. Again, I mean, you talk about things like apparel and the trends that we\u2019re seeing like in Carhartt, Ariat as well as our own exclusive brands, whether it be like in Ridgecut and expanding into women\u2019s, those are the things that we\u2019re really looking to attack. As well as like in pet, constant, constant newness that the team is going after, whether it be like the introduction of brands like Victor and Tractor Supply as well as doubling down on brands that we\u2019re really seeing growth for like that would be considered specialty for the rural marketplace like science diet, Proplan, etcetera. And I can go around the store. And if you think about things like where we have big opportunities, we\u2019re approaching spring. And you mentioned Chick Days, we\u2019ve talked about live goods. But we\u2019ve also got things like the electrification of these new shoppers that are in \u2013 or the OPE market, these new shoppers per coming in. We announced this past week, our partnership that I\u2019m really excited about with Greenworks and Greenworks Pro. We know shoppers have been trending towards the battery market, but we\u2019ve been really waiting on a product that we believe that would stand up to the demands of consumer. And that\u2019s what we really went after and have created this partnership with them. That\u2019s just like one area and one category that we continue to talk to. But we\u2019re really not playing in today, but we\u2019re going after, and we\u2019re going to continue to go after that with market share and play in the future. So absolutely agree that I can talk about product all day long and within our store and not just in the store, but also online with Rob and team with the product expansion there. So John, I\u2019ll turn it over to talk about experiences. John Ordus : Yes. Hey, Scott. Good to see you, again. Scott Mushkin : Hey, John. Good to see you. John Ordus : So I\u2019m going to break it down in a couple different parts. So one is we hire our customers. So our team members love talking about everything that we have inside of our stores. So you brought up chick days, it\u2019s an event side of our store, where we have chick captains in there. They know the chicks. They work with the chicks when customers come in here, there is a good conversation that goes back and forth between that customer and that team member. The other things we do is stuff for our Greenworks, like we love theater inside of the side of the store. So some events we\u2019re doing this year, like try before you buy, we have an even a weekend where our team members are all going to be outside, and we\u2019re going to be test driving the Greenworks and using the blowers and using the weed whipper and different things and using our different power equipment materials. The other thing is we love to be able to have the community involvement. So we bring in things like 4-H, FFA. We do things like hot dogs outside. We\u2019ve come in, our customers do donations for them, but we have it where they can talk to each other, do chicken swaps and different things out front. So we kind of break up into many different parts, but we look to be part of those individual communities. Hal Lawton : Yes. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And as you were mentioning, just in wrap up here, we are literally pushing every corner of the store really into kind of a more modern, contemporary assortment, right? A Seth shared, shared expansion of power tools into kind of a legitimate tool chorale, expansion of pet into full fledge pet offering, deepening our commitment around animal feed, expanding into live goods, bringing in services like pet wash. John has over 250 stores now doing delivery with our own trucks. So just so many things that we\u2019re pushing the envelope, so to speak, on every inch of the store, all around just sweating our assets more, getting more productivity out of those stores and delivering those mid-single-digit comps. Our goal is to gain market share every single year to grow above GDP, to grow above retail and to grow above growth rates. And we think we\u2019ve got an exciting plan to do that. Scott Mushkin : Thanks, guys. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Scott. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks so much, Scott. Up next is Joe Feldman with TAG. Hi, Joe. Please go ahead with your question. Joe Feldman : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, given everything you just said about all the opportunities that you do have in front of you. You\u2019ve mentioned tuck-in acquisitions a few times. And I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re thinking there. Is that more to acquire small competitors? Is it getting into new product lines or categories or even just for infrastructure to run the business better? I just wanted you to share some thoughts on that. Hal Lawton : Yes, Kurt, do you want to share our capital allocation strategy and then talk about tuck-in acquisitions after that? Kurt Barton : Yes, definitely. Just to \u2013 I\u2019ll start with reiterating the capital allocation. Certainly, our number one priority is investing in our stores, and we see still significant opportunity, as I mentioned, nearly a decade of growth in the runway of new stores. The investments we\u2019re making to sweat those assets and put more productivity in the stores that already have the occupancy and the rent there. So Joe, to your point, first, we\u2019ve got so much opportunity in the growth of the business and grab the total addressable market and grab market share there. Then of course, after that, we feel with the tremendous step-up in growth and the consistent operating cash flow will return to with the opportunity, both dividend and share repurchases, thrilled to be able to announce the Board\u2019s approval of a 77% increase in dividends. As far as the tuck-in acquisitions then, where there are opportunities. We\u2019ve not been highly acquisitive. We feel there is so much opportunity in our core. But where there are opportunities, Tractor Supply is sometimes that an exit strategy in our niche industry, where there is area that we are not in. I mean we\u2019re open to that opportunity. If we look at it and say, hey, there is opportunity to grab the real estate we\u2019re not in or to complement. And so if there is a acquisition, if there is a capability that builds on one of the strategic initiatives that you hear from us as part of Life Out Here strategy to buy versus build, we will look at that opportunity. But it\u2019s certainly more of that opportunistic things on our radar and really excited about what we\u2019ve got right in front of us, and there may be complementary opportunities. Joe Feldman : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks, Joe. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Hi, Brian, how are you? Brian Nagel : Good. How are you doing? Good morning. Great presentation, thank you. So my question \u2013 I know it\u2019s a bit of a follow-up to some of the prior questions. But I mean clearly one of the big themes in today\u2019s meet in all the comments is just the rebasing higher sales. And as I think about that dynamic, clearly, there is now \u2013 there is more people sort of say there is a large portion of population living a lifestyle that wins to Tractor Supply. But at the same time, you have \u2013 you\u2019ve taken market share gains. There is always been this market share opportunity for Tractor Supply, and we talked about that for years. But I guess as you look \u2013 maybe more color on what you\u2019re actually seeing with market share? I mean through the academic where there are more permanent changes in your competitive set that lend to these sustainability some market share gains? Or \u2013 and on the other side, are you seeing \u2013 is this is happening? Are you starting to see some competitors that maybe seeded share starting to fight back more now? Hal Lawton : Hey, Brian, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll break it into three buckets. First off, we talked about over the last few years, our market grew at about 25% in aggregate over those 2 years. And I think that does say to all the trends that we\u2019ve outlined and you implied in your question. The second two things I\u2019ll highlight are really around investment. We\u2019ve got substantial structural advantages in our digital business, in our Neighbor\u2019s Club, in our supply chain, in our store base and the way we train our team members, the technology we use inside of our stores for our team members like our Theatro headsets and our Honeywell handheld devices. And so \u2013 and those are things that we have historically invested in and there are things we invested in over the last 2 years. It was mentioned earlier about our operating margins come up in the context of our sales, perhaps not grown as much as some others out there. And the reason is because we put a lot of that expense back into the business, we kept our stores heavily staffed, we paid the appropriate wages, we invested in marketing, we invested in digital. And I think as we talked we gained \u2013 our sales grew over 50% over the last few years. And it\u2019s really \u2013 the reason we been able to double the market growth rate is because we had the inventory in our stores. We had the people to service them. We had buy online, pick up in store when others didn\u2019t. We had a Neighbor\u2019s Club program talk those customers and bringing them back into the stores. We had a supply chain that partnerships that allow product to flow in a way that others couldn\u2019t. And once people over 2 years change their shopping behaviors, it\u2019s really quite infrequent for them to slip back unless we let them down. The third thing is all the structural all the incremental investments we\u2019ve made in our Life Out Here strategy, the Fusion stores, the garden center stores, all the incremental technology investments we made. Last year, we talked about mid-single digits on Fusion, doubled \u2013 high single digits on the Side Lot combo stores. And that was only on 300 and 150 stores. So we are starting to see kind of the initial impact of those in our comps, and we\u2019re excited about those continuing to drive our business in the future, plus it\u2019s holding on to those customers and having a higher sales base. But I kind of break it into those three buckets, structural trends driving the overall market, us being committed to operating with excellence in the midst of the last 2 years and then investing on top of that with that momentum to gain even more share. Brian Nagel : Thanks, Hal. That\u2019s really helpful. Congrats. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Brian. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks, Brian. Next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Hi, Karen. How are you today? Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much everyone. Yes, a couple of questions. Just actually following up on that, when you think about your top line growth versus your unit growth within the context of your algorithm, how should we think about that relationship? Because depending on the scenarios, I guess growing a little bit at rate and sales on the algorithm. And then the second question I had is on your increased unit potential, I was wondering if you could just talk about that analysis in more detail, given the 40 million incremental potential customers, I actually would have thought that your unit potential is higher? Hal Lawton : Yes. So, I will take the unit potential question then turn it back to Kurt to talk about operating margin leverage. On the unit potential, what we have is John and the team have been very sophisticated kind of map of our country, kind of ZIP code by ZIP code. We know what the demand potential is. We know where our stores are, we know where competitive stores are. And we look at those void spaces that are in that map. We then take those void spaces and bounce them up against the financial model and say, does it create value if we put a store there? And historically, that analysis has led us to 2,500 stores. Now with the growth in our market, that creates one, some new void spaces, but also it makes some void spaces that were not previously financially attractive, more financially attractive now. As I mentioned, our new stores over the last 3 years have significantly outperformed their business case. Our new stores are profitable in the first year. And so the combination of those factors led us to take our new store target up from 2,500 to 2,700. And we feel very confident in that number. And hopefully, in a couple of years, there is more on top of that, but we feel very good about that number. And Kurt can talk about our operating margin leverage. Kurt Barton : Yes. Hey Karen, good to see you. Let me ask for clarification because you broke up a it on the question on EBIT. So, I know it was an EBIT margin question and also referencing sales growth, but maybe just clarify that. Karen Short : Well, no, it was thinking about the EBIT growth percent relative to the sales growth, right? So, we don\u2019t know what you have done historically, but within your guidance, I think that to a decent rainwear site to range where the growth grows in line with sales growth or it grows slightly at a greater rate. So, just wondering how you think about that within the context of the algorithm? Kurt Barton : Yes, great. From an operating standpoint, I mean the \u2013 again, I will just reference the key \u2013 if the question is regarding our long-term outlook, and we think about the EBIT margin in there is that we see an important opportunity right now to make investments, and a lot of that investment will be in the stores technology and in our supply chain. And so as we make the investments and those investment pressures are on SG&A, we also see great leverage through our operating efficiencies, the leverage from the growth in the sales. And so we have \u2013 over the next 3 years to 5 years, we see definite inflation and pressure from investments that we can offset with the leverage and with the operating efficiencies. On the gross margin side, we also see over time that we have got the opportunity from those investments able to grow our gross margin. So, there is some good opportunity in here with our scale and with the work that Colin and Seth are doing to be able to grow some of that gross margin at a faster rate and really see that opportunity there. So, from the algorithm, our assumption is that these investments are growing the top line, but also giving our gross margin an opportunity to grow. And there is likely to be more growth in the operating margin over that 5-year period in our assumption from the gross margin side as we balance out our efficiencies, our investments in the SG&A side. Karen Short : Okay. Thank you very much. Hal Lawton : And Karen, the only thing I would say is like in a really simple way for me is you have got revenue growth of kind of 6% to 7%. And then you got the EPS growth, which Kurt took us through at 8% to 11%, and then you were buying a couple of percent of share back. So, if you take those out, we are kind of growing EPS kind of 6% to 9% organically, which means earnings are going to grow kind of with sales or slightly better on an annualized basis on average. And which means kind of particularly after this next year to cycle of investment, we will grow kind of operating margin about 0.1 point a year, and that kind of leads you up to that 10.6%. Mary Winn Pilkington : That\u2019s great clarification there Hal. Up next on the line is Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hi. Thanks. Great presentation, everyone. A lot of great statistics today, but the one that really called my eye was the 40 million additional customers in your trade area. So, I was hoping, Christi could speak to the timeline for acquiring these new shoppers. And then as a follow-up for Hal on the gross margins, I believe you spoke to roughly flattish for 2022. How should we think about the cadence of gross margins throughout the year? Christi Korzekwa : Yes. Hi Chuck. Thanks for the question. I love talking about our customers. And just thinking about our customers pre-pandemic or when the pandemic first started through 2020, we acquired 11 million new customers. We are still comping the pre-pandemic numbers in 2021. We have more new customers in 2021 than we did pre-pandemic. So, 10 million to 11 million a year is what we are attracting, and 50% of those are returning to us after they shop. So, we are attracting and retaining a lot of new customers. And with the new work with the TAM and the opportunity in Fusion and Side Lot, there is so much more opportunity for us to really begin to attract even more than those 10 million a year new customers. But we are on a trend line right now of 10 million to 11 million new customers every year, and I would see us just accelerating that over time. Hal Lawton : Yes. And I would just speak, Christi and the team are just doing an outstanding job. I think raising the awareness of our business, going from 34 points 2 years ago to 55 points. Now, that 21-point awareness increase, I think has really helped kind of drive traffic into our stores. And then whether it\u2019s through online and product assortment or John and the team at customer service, that conversion in the store and then holding those customers. And then I think just continues to build on top of itself as we continue to grow that awareness and have that fantastic experience in our store and online. As it relates to the kind of operating margin algorithm, I think the way we think about it is very similar to the way we have talked about the last couple of years, which is we would see us continuing to kind of that 10.1% to 10.6%. Last year, we did a 10.3%. The year before that, it was a 10.1%. And the bulk of that gain was really in gross margin rate as we held SG&A kind of roughly flat. As we think about the next few years, particularly once we get through this peak investment over this year and next year. I think gross margins will hold to maybe moderate some. And then the leverage is where that we will see will be in SG&A. And that\u2019s what kind of gives us that range between 10.1% and 10.6% with us creeping towards the middle to higher end of the range as we get into the out years of the 5-year range. And Seth and the team are doing a fantastic job navigating all the cost inflations that are coming through, offsetting it in ways they can and then passing through some on price. And then importantly, maintaining little to no promotions and then also little to no clearance. And the great thing is we list on last year, we were asking whether or not the little to no promotions could remain kind of structural in nature or whether or not that would creep back in. And I think after a couple of years, really the behaviors in the market have evolved, particularly as we look at this year and continuing to be constrained still in supply chain. So, we feel really good about maintaining kind of little to no promotions as we look into future and kind of stay in core to our EDLP trip routes. Chuck Grom : Alright. Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks Chuck. And our next question comes from Oli Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Hey Oli, how are you today. Oli Wintermantel : Hi. I am good. Thanks. Thanks very much for the presentations today. I had a question regarding the longer term outlook on your transactions or traffic within the comps. If you think about what drives your traffic within the stores. And then on an inflation basis, if that normalizes over the next 5 years, how do you think about the mix between traffic and transactions? Kurt Barton : Yes. Hey Oliver, I will take that. First, I will start by just talking about 2022 as a quick reminder, and then beyond that. So, for 2022, what we have said is we plan and are targeting positive comp transaction and positive comp ticket. And ticket likely to lead more than transaction in 2022. Beyond 2022, while every year could be a bit different, what we think about it is it\u2019s really going to be pretty balanced. And if you refer back to some of the real drivers of our comps that we have talked about, you have got Fusion and Side Lot that are driving traffic into the store with new categories. They are also driving ticket, digital doing the same thing, the work that John and Colin talked about on delivering on legendary service. These types of things, we really see the strategic initiatives that we have got and the momentum in the business that in the 2023 to 2026 period of time is that we have got opportunity to be really balanced between both of those because these strategic initiatives are focused long-term on driving market share, which means traffic, which means footsteps into the stores and clicks on the website. Oli Wintermantel : Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro at Stephens. Hi Daniel, how are you? Daniel Imbro : Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the info today and taking the question. I had a two-parter for Hal and Colin, just as we think about growth on your existing infrastructure, maybe how in the stores, as we think about store efficiency, are you seeing any throughput issues as the team is handling more volume? How is store turnover doing as the team members are being asked to handle more? And then Colin, you talked about the DC investments. But can you talk about any investments in existing DCs to improve efficiencies? And then maybe you can provide an update on turnover given the wage investments you made? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hi Daniel. Thanks for joining us today and I appreciate the question. I would start by saying, we have seen some modest increases in our turnover this year, certainly relative to last year when turnovers were at all-time lows. But I think we fared much better than most companies. One, first and foremost, because of our culture and our commitment to mission and values and all the things that John talked about earlier around our commitment to the communities and hiring our customers. And then secondly, we have made substantial investments in wages and benefits and other benefits over the last couple of years, which have served us well in terms of retention. And then in terms of kind of flow through the business, our \u2013 we are up substantially on C.U.E. over the last couple of years. No one sells more animal feed and bag animal feed in the country than we do. We are one of the top retailers on pet food as well. And interestingly, on \u2013 particularly on the pet side, our customers skew larger on their pets, right. So, we sell more than anyone 50-pound bags of dog food and certainly the vast majority of our animal food are 50-pound bags, and that\u2019s flow through, a lot of tonnage through. We are the lowest cost to serve all those in the market. We are committed to being the lowest cost to serve. We are committed to be able to be in stock on those. And that\u2019s really a lot of what Colin\u2019s presentation and focus is going to be on for the next couple of years and let him elaborate a bit on that. Colin Yankee : Sure. Daniel, thanks for the question. As far as turnover, I think Hal answered that. But with investment in our existing distribution centers to drive throughput, I just can\u2019t thank our team enough. They hit a record level throughput this last year. And I would say it\u2019s more than just the distribution centers. It\u2019s really tough to execute that we have a planning problem. So, it starts upstream with working with our vendors, with our replenishment allocation, with our transportation team to make sure we set the distribution centers are for success. So, the team is at phenomenally in 2020 and 2021, given all the different disruptions that we have well publicized across the supply chain. Within the four walls of our existing distribution centers, we are really reaping the benefits this last year and going into 2022 of investments we made in profit improvement over the previous years with bringing all of our systems up to the common execution platform across all distribution centers. Two, engineered labor standards within our facilities to drive throughput and efficiency to schedule flexibility and communication with our team members. And most importantly, to the quality of leadership that we have in developing our frontline leaders because we know our team members can go work at other distribution centers, and these distribution centers intense kind of geographical areas, but they choose to work at Tractor Supply because of our culture, because of our mission, because of the way they are treated in those facilities. And that\u2019s an enduring strength that\u2019s going to carry us through for the next foreseeable future. Daniel Imbro : Thank you. Good luck. Hal Lawton : Thanks Daniel. Appreciate it. Mary Winn Pilkington : And our next question comes from Steve Zaccone at Citi. Hi Steve. Steve Zaccone : Great. Hi Mary Winn. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the presentation today. I had a question on 2022 and then just a follow-up on like the longer term targets. So, we think about 2022 from an inflation perspective, could you talk about the level of inflation from maybe a category perspective relative to what you saw in 2021? It seems like it\u2019s more broad-based than the nature. And the other question I had just on the longer term targets, the last time you met with us, you talked about a potential giveback year to cycling some of the strength. It doesn\u2019t seem like this is factoring in a give-back year. What\u2019s really driving the confidence that you don\u2019t have that give-back here? Seth Estep : Hi Steve, this is Seth. Relative to inflation and what that outlook is this year versus this past year, what I would say is if you were to go back to 2021 in the beginning of that year, it really started with the commodity markets, right? And you think about grains, then we move more into steel, then other cost pressures continued on our supplier side, continue to roll to, call it, cost of goods pressure, whether that would be getting components from overseas to here, their labor rates, etcetera. And what I would say is we are \u2013 as we have entered into 2022 and where we are today, it is more broad-based. And so relative to last year, you are looking more broad-based across the four walls. What I would say about that, though, is when we think about our pricing sophistication, we know where the price is coming at us. And we know what\u2019s in front of us and our \u2013 and the team has done a fantastic job from an analyst perspective, utilizing our tools to be able to go out and make sure that be priced right in the market, to drive market share, measure elasticities and at the same time, make sure that we can manage the P&L accordingly. So, as you look at last year, it did really started commodities, really went into steel. Now it is more broad-based and that\u2019s where we see it heading in 2022. Kurt Barton : Hi, Steven. I will take the question on the reference back to the last enhanced earnings call, where we had that give-back year. And your reference, I am assuming you go back to that line graph that many have referred back when they are talking with me about it. And really back then, the question was all about structural or transitory, and really how resilient is this step-up in growth. And 15 months ago, there was that legitimate question of how much of this growth is a temporary shift in behavior that\u2019s in favor of Tractor Supply. But all the things that we have talked about and what Christi mentioned in regards to the permanent shifts in some of the customers, not only geographic locations, but what the hobbies are and people entering in our lifestyle, millennials buying homes, those types of things began to get answered over an 18-month period of time. I will reference back to, as an example, one of the slides I presented, I think is really powerful that over this period of time, what we saw that we had growth from new customers, 30% but then growth in existing new categories of the product as well into existing digital as well as in brick-and-mortar and the fact that our growth was from transactions and ticket. And when you look at transaction and basket, it was the biggest piece of it, so really broad, diverse growth in it and the fact that we have had consistency. Best way to give an example on the consistency. Last three quarters, 40% almost to a tee, each of those quarters, 2 years back on the comp. So, as we work through that, it really solidified that these are enduring customer relationships that are benefiting Tractor Supply. It\u2019s really the difference between what our outlook was 15 months ago versus what we are presenting today, and really excited about that for the future. Steve Zaccone : Very helpful guys. Thanks very much. Hal Lawton : Thanks Steven. Appreciate it. Mary Winn Pilkington : And our next question comes from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Hi Liz. Liz Suzuki : Hey. Thanks so much for hosting this event. I just had a follow-up to Karen\u2019s question about the store base. Is it correct to assume that essentially all of those 2,700 stores will ultimately have Fusion layout and that the vast majority will have Side Lot, or are there any alternative store formats that might be considered in that 2,700 number? And a related question about Petsense, and what you view as the long-term opportunity for that store base? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hi Liz. Yes, that\u2019s correct. All new stores are being built with the Fusion layouts. So \u2013 and that was the case in 2021 and will be the case moving forward. As it relates to the garden center, it\u2019s really on a store-by-store basis, whether or not the store is built with a garden center, depends on what the market opportunity assessment tells us. What I would say is this year in 2022, the vast majority of our new stores will have the garden center, and that\u2019s incremental to some of the guidance that we gave on our existing store base through the presentation. And then as it relates to Petsense, we haven\u2019t had a chance to talk about that business today, but the business is doing very well. Matthew Rubin joined us last year about this time to lead the business, done an excellent job of kind of driving the business. They had an excellent year, strong sales growth and profit growth, a number of new stores built. We have made several elements of integration that are customer facing like we now sell for health branded food inside of Petsense. We are in the process of doing some things in terms of integration later in the year on Neighbor\u2019s Club and also some integration on branding. We are also taking our software now implemented that inside of Petsense. And we are also working on kind of a centralized inventory platform, whereas right now, the stores are done via kind of the individual store base. And so a lot of work is going on to leverage the breadth of Tractor Supply to make Petsense better. The team is doing a great job driving it. We have got a number of new stores that will be built for Petsense this year, and we are excited about the future of that business. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you so much. Mary Winn Pilkington : We have got time for two more questions. So, we will go up to two more questions. And up next is Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Hi Bobby. Bobby, we are having a little bit of trouble hearing you. Bobby Griffin : Thank you, Mary Winn. Yes. Sorry about that. I guess I just want to quickly unpack the long-term growth targets. Is the rate \u2013 and what the embedded market rate is in those targets? Is the right way to think about it is the market grows, say, 3 to 4 Tractor that picks up a point of market growth share in comps, or is the market growth going to grow in line with comps and then the market share gains come from the new store growth? Hal Lawton : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I think we think about it the latter, that kind of long-term GDP, the country is kind of 2% to 3%. Our market typically maybe grows kind of 0.5-ish point above that, 2.5% to 3.5%, maybe ease up to 4% with our comp guidance of 4% and 5%. We are certainly taking share in the markets that we are already in. And then the building of new stores just allows us to take incremental share on top of that. So, it\u2019s a bit of a blend of the two scenarios you mentioned, but it\u2019s certainly taking share with our existing stores, growing our sales productivity. And then on top of that, also gaining it through both new store build-outs as well as digital. Bobby Griffin : Thank you. Best of luck. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks Bobby. And our last question will come from John Lawrence with Benchmark. John, please go ahead with your question. John Lawrence : Great. Thanks for doing this today, that\u2019s great and congrats on the year. Can you talk a little bit about the pet business. And you mentioned the pet washes and the wellness clinics. Can you talk a little bit what happens when you add one of those into the business? Does that customer go around and shop? Just so how much does he pull from other categories? I think you mentioned you had over 40. How big could that business be? And what are you seeing with the availability of veterinarians in this environment? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hi. Thanks for the questions. First off, I would start off by saying our pet business is incredibly strong. We talked about our C.U.E. and its performance over the last handful of quarters, out-comping our overall store. And then we mentioned that pet particularly dry dog food is outperforming even our C.U.E. business. So, our pet business is very strong, both in-store and online. And then we certainly want to make sure we are providing a full suite of services around that. And I will let John talk a little bit about the dynamics and we have a pet wash or a pet clinic or a mobile clinic and how that plays out in our stores. John Ordus : Yes. Thanks John for the question. So, our pet washes \u2013 so as soon as a customer uses the pet wash, they continue to come back and back and back. They love using the pet wash. They like to come back. We have pet washers where some stores will do over 100 a week in pet washes. So, the customer really likes it. They enjoy it, they love that feed and they like being able to take care of their pet. It doesn\u2019t have to always be a dog though. Sometimes it\u2019s something else. You asked about what they do after that. So, let\u2019s go into the store and the number one thing they buy is the collar. Because the first thing you do if you wash your pet is you want to get something new for the pet, so you will get a collar. They will also pick up some other while they can\u2019t get the rest of their shopping done. Out of the pet wellness clinics or the mobile clinics that come up to the front of our stores, we have lines out in front of our stores for these clinics. Customers use them. We advertise them out there, Christi and her team to get it out there. And then customers will come in, they will sign up and then they love getting their dogs taking care of out there. So, it\u2019s something our customers really like. They love the fact that we do it for them, they love the convenience about it. John Lawrence : How many of those stores could you add over time or those projects? Hal Lawton : Yes. So, pet wash is now kind of a core component set outline of our Fusion stores. Really, the only time it\u2019s not going into a Fusion stores when there is a legit kind of a real space limitation. So, we see over time, the vast majority of our stores having a pet wash. The mobile clinics, the vast majority of our stores already have mobile clinics. At a minimum, it\u2019s every two weeks, but there is a lot of our stores that had it twice a week. And then on the wellness clinics, that what I think is still a bit more in a testing mode for us. As Seth talked, we are in that kind of 50 store, 60 store range. We will add some more this year through Fusion, but we are really excited about the benefits and the performance of those, and we will look to do more as we see the performance over the next year or 2 years. John Lawrence : Alright. Thanks. Congratulations and good luck. Hal Lawton : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Alright. Well, that\u2019s going to be our final question. As always, those were some great questions. So thank you, everybody, for your time today. We really appreciate you joining us virtually to learn more about what we think makes Tractor Supply such a special company. I also wanted to take a minute to thank Marianne Denenberg, and a multitude of others at the company who helped pull off today\u2019s event to showcase Tractor Supply. An event of this scale takes a lot of partnership to all of those at Tractor Supply that supported Investor Relations program. Please accept my sincere appreciation and gratitude on behalf of the investment community. And thanks to all of you for taking time out of your day to join us virtually. We look forward to speaking to you again on our first quarter 2020 call in April. And Marianne and I will be around today to take any questions this afternoon. Take care, and please stay safe.",

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to begin by thanking the Tractor Supply team for again delivering strong results. In some ways, this quarter may have been our best relative performance over the course of the last two years. The team demonstrated grit and determination as they overcame the lapping of last year\u2019s robust performance, the impacts of the Omicron variant, particularly in January, the significant inflationary pressures and the ongoing supply chain constraints, the last two of which were both exacerbated by the tragic conflict in Ukraine. No matter what came at the team, they stepped up to the challenge to be there for our customers as a dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. Our team members, our vendors and other supply chain partners have continued to rise to the occasion as we strive to live our mission and values every day. Speaking of our mission and values, in recognition of Earth Week, this week, we issued our Stewards of Life Out Here Sustainability Report. This comprehensive report provides detailed information and progress on our ESG efforts. It significantly enhances our transparency and disclosure related to our environmental sustainability actions. Of note, in the report is the establishment of a new water usage goal to reduce on an absolute level our water footprint by 25 million gallons by 2025. ESG makes great business sense for Tractor Supply. And setting targets for ourselves in these areas creates long-term value and allows us to have a positive impact on the world and the communities that we call home. As a purpose-driven company, we remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. Now, let\u2019s turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2022. The year started out on a strong note. We grew net sales by 8.3% with comparable store sales up 5.2%. Diluted EPS was $1.65, an increase of 6.5% year-over-year. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.7%, offset by a decline in transactions of 1.4%. Given the remarkable strength in our business last year, and as a reminder, we had a 38.6% comp in Q1 last year. We are very pleased with our sales growth. Last year, we shared with you that we materially benefited in the quarter from a combination of factors, in particular stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. This quarter, we successfully navigated the lapping of these factors, despite the spring season getting off to a slow start. On inflation, it benefited sales in the quarter by about 10 percentage points. As we shared on our last earnings call, we thought there was more pressure to the upside on inflation as we entered the quarter and that is certainly what we saw. We continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs and our product categories as well as the underlying variables like higher labor wage rates and transport costs that are impacting our vendor partners. Shifting to C.U.E. We experienced impressive demand in our consumable, usable and edible categories. As a reminder, these products are need-based and demand-driven, and they\u2019re what drive trips into our stores. Our C.U.E. sales growth was almost 3 times our overall sales growth rate. Our C.U.E. customer trends have never been stronger. Kind of rounding out the business, seasonal category performance was mixed as we had solid performance in our winter season categories during a much colder January, but our spring season categories performed below average due to colder weather temperatures in the month of March. Shifting to e-commerce. E-commerce again saw double-digit growth, and this represented our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit or better growth in e-commerce. We are making great strides in expanding our digital presence. Of note, our mobile app now represents more than 15% of our digital sales. This quarter, we crossed 3 million downloads of the Tractor Supply app. And this is a major milestone in our ONETractor strategy and our ability to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program reached a record 24.8 million members in the quarter, an increase of 24% from last year\u2019s first quarter. It seems like much longer than a year ago, but we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the relaunch of Neighbor\u2019s Club to a points-based loyalty program. The relaunch has been an overwhelming success as it has measurably encouraged customers to migrate their spending upwards. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club members are comping at a faster overall rate than our overall company performance, and we\u2019re seeing strong growth and retention in our high-value customers. We are confident in our business short term and long term. Last quarter, we shared with you several structural trends from which we\u2019re benefiting, including world revitalization, increased pet ownership, home setting and the rise in self-reliance. As the market leader, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from these structural trends. Additionally, we are seeing increasing momentum from our Life Out Here strategic initiatives, enabling us to continue to gain share. As we look forward, we believe we have many vectors for growth, and our business has never been stronger. That said, we acknowledge that there is significant uncertainty in the macro environment. We have a lot of the year still ahead of us. And in keeping with our longstanding practices prior to the pandemic, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half. On the heels of last year\u2019s record performance and a strong start to the year, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year 2022. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. I\u2019ll briefly address the Orscheln acquisition. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update in the coming months. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. The Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. On a two-year stack, our comparable store sales were 43.8%. Looking at the cadence of the quarter, January and February were the strongest months with March positive, albeit not at the rate earlier in the quarter. We benefited from cold weather trends early in the quarter, while spring is late to break across most of the country. Please keep in mind, we were comping ideal weather conditions in the first quarter of last year with an early spring across many of our markets. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 10 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. As we shared with you last quarter, we anticipated this would be the toughest compare on transactions as we cycled the largest transaction gain since the beginning of the pandemic in Q1 of last year of 21%. To illustrate, we were experiencing positive comp transactions until we cycled the last two weeks of the quarter where we clearly saw the benefits of stimulus on transactions in the prior year. As we expected, big ticket declined given the robust performance we were cycling, driven by stimulus and the early starts of the spring selling season. Last year, as we reported, big ticket comps significantly outperformed the chain average comps. And on a two-year stack, our big ticket performance exceeded the 43.8% comp growth of the chain. We continue to see strong C.U.E. performance with strength in categories such as dry dog food, poultry, feed and heating fuel. For instance, dry dog food achieved over a 20% comp. Petsense performed above the company average, which was in line with our pet performance. Overall, we were very pleased with our top line performance. Turning now to gross margin, which outperformed our expectations. For the first quarter, our gross margin declined by 29 basis points to 34.9% of sales. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to three factors : significant product cost inflation; higher transportation costs; and to a lesser extent, product mix. We continue to experience broad-based inflation while also seeing a step-up during the quarter in key commodities such as grains and oil. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. We expect many of these trends in product cost and freight to continue throughout 2022. The robust growth in our C.U.E. categories, which have a lower gross profit rate did put some pressure on gross margin. The team did a remarkable job of managing these cost increases through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. Examples include capturing efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor\u2019s Club. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 26.9%, an improvement of 11 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to the normalization of incentive compensation, moderation of COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and incremental costs related to our Life Out Here strategic investments for growth. This includes a step-up in our depreciation and amortization. Please also keep in mind, given our results last year, we were cycling strong SG&A leverage, which benefited from 38.6% comp sales in the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $187 million, and diluted EPS was $1.65 compared to $1.55 in the first quarter of 2021. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Last quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 77% from $0.52 a share to $0.92. During the quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong and provides us the ability to invest in our business for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, along with our investment in inventory to support the growing demand. Moving now to our guidance for 2022, which is unchanged. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are reconfirming our guidance for the year. This includes net sales in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion with comparable store sales growth of 3% to 4.5%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. We continue to expect diluted EPS in a range of $9.20 to $9.50. We acknowledge that we beat our own expectations for the first quarter and that ongoing inflation should benefit our top line. With the dynamic macro environment as a backdrop, we believe it\u2019s prudent to maintain our outlook for the year. Keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter of the year, and it\u2019s great to start out the year ahead of our expectations. We recognize that flowing the first quarter performance through may put pressure towards the top end of our guidance ranges. For those of you who\u2019ve followed us for some time, this is not a new convention to guidance and is in line with how we provided guidance historically prior to the pandemic. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. With as much inflation pressures we\u2019re seeing in our business, we are closely watching comparable average ticket and transactions. We anticipate that the breakdown of growth may be a bit different than our prior expectations, given the high level of inflation benefiting average ticket with transactions seeing incremental pressure. Historically, we\u2019ve experienced trip consolidation by consumers during strong inflationary times. As inflation pressures persist, it puts higher pressure on gross margin, yet provides an offsetting benefit to SG&A leverage. As such, we\u2019re maintaining our expectations on our operating margin. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. In summary, -- we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our outlook for 2022. The team is executing at a very high level. We remain committed to investing in the business to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers. Our goals are to maintain our everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to drive strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Last quarter at our Enhanced Earnings Event, we shared significant details on our Life Out Here strategy. We believe we have a robust idiosyncratic drivers for growth over time. Our strategy is gaining traction and the team is executing well. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our customer, including our Neighbor\u2019s Club, and provide some highlights of our merchandising initiatives for the spring and summer season. Our customer trends are in great shape, and we\u2019re committed to capturing wallet share through legendary customer service, our numerous digital properties, our seamless shopping experience and our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program. Our customer base continues to be remarkably healthy and highly engaged with our brands. In our Q2 2020 earnings call, nearly two years ago, we discussed that our goal was to nurture and capitalize on the generational growth we were seeing in our customer base, seizing on the opportunities to retain millions of new customers and expand share of wallet with our core customers and expand the number of capital categories shopped by both customer sets. And I\u2019m pleased to share with you today that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing in our customer base. Our active customer base is now much larger and coming into the pandemic, as we have retained the majority of the millions of new customers that shopped us the last couple of years. And our active customers are driving frequency and spending more money. On our new customers, we continue to see strong new customer acquisition with absolute run rates that are at pre-COVID levels and very stable. Continuing on a theme since 2020, our new customers continue to skew younger. We\u2019re seeing ongoing growth in our millennial shoppers as there\u2019s been a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by millennials. Since the start of the pandemic, the most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in the millennial customer supports the vibrancy and relevance of the Tractor Supply brand well into the future. Another positive contributor to our strong sales growth has been our Neighbor\u2019s Club. As I mentioned earlier, the revamp of the program in April of last year from an Infinity program to tiered points-based loyalty program has been rapidly adopted by our customers. Neighbor\u2019s Club is a significant growth platform for us. Notably, we reached our highest level of customer spending over $1,000 annually, and we also reached our highest level of customers ever spending over $2,000 annually. Transactions, total sales and spend per active Neighbor\u2019s Club member, all grew significantly in the quarter. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the structural tailwinds I mentioned earlier, such as rural revitalization, pet ownership, home setting and self-reliance. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever, and we\u2019re investing to ensure we continue to play offence in the context of these trends. The overall health of our customer base contributes to our confidence in our outlook for the year. Let\u2019s shift to spring. Our stores and e-commerce are well-positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. As of today, we have over 175 garden centers customer-ready for spring. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the end of the year. Where spring has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers\u2019 response to the expanded product offering and layout. To capture incremental share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we\u2019ve expanded our offerings of battery-powered outdoor power equipment. Tractor Supply is the exclusive retailer of the Greenworks Pro 60-volt platform which includes more than 75 battery-operated professional-grade residential tools, including zero-turn riding and push mowers, chainsaws, trimmers, leaf blowers, snow throwers and more. Tractor Supply began offering Greenworks Pro 60-volt products online earlier this year, and we rolled them out in our stores the past few weeks. Notably, the addition of battery-operated zero-turn mower from Greenworks strengthens our position as the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. This past Saturday, we hosted a Try Before You Buy event at our stores that allowed our customers an opportunity to test drive our market-leading assortment and the various models in our stores. Chick Days are always an exciting time in store and something that our customers look forward to with the change of seasons to spring. We sell millions of birds each year. And this year, we\u2019ve expanded our breed options as well as widened our coop, feed and care assortment. This is a great example of a home setting category for our new millennial customer who\u2019s adopting the Out Here lifestyle. And importantly, our store teams have the knowledge to help a customer in the category, whether they are a novice or an expert. We have a leading lineup of top selling, highest quality tools that are relative to our customers. Last week, we announced the addition of Dremel and Bosch to our power tool lineup just in time for spring. As mentioned on several previous calls, a key component of Project Fusion is an expansion of our assortment in truck, tool and hardware. Our lineup and tools now include Makita, DeWalt, PORTER-CABLE exclusively, Bosch and Dremel. We are much more of a destination now for our customers in this category. And as an aside, we\u2019re also on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year-end. To wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making incredible progress for laying the foundation for the future. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over numerous different types of business cycles. With significant growth and market share opportunities ahead of us, it\u2019s an exciting time to be at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go off to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Scot, Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So, I guess, my question is, with the 10% impact from pricing in the comp, what kind of, if any, demand structure are you guys seeing? And kind of related to that, how should we think about the impact on the top line from inflation as we get later in the year because obviously, we\u2019re going to be cycling larger impacts as we go? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Hey Scot. Good morning. And thanks for joining our call. I appreciate the question. I\u2019d start out just at the highest level. Consumer\u2019s very healthy. As Kurt mentioned, we exceeded our expectations in Q1, and kind of a few nuances on that. Where we -- in the business where we\u2019re lapping the stimulus from last year, notably in big ticket, we saw some follow-up there, but it was very much in line with what we expected and what we had foreshadowed at our enhanced earnings event, when we talked about some pressure from big ticket dominantly in the last part of Q1 and early part of Q2. As Kurt mentioned and I mentioned also in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a slow start to spring, but it\u2019s been in the categories you would expect, and spring always comes. We\u2019ve had it -- play out in many different ways over the last couple of decades on spring, but otherwise, really seeing no elasticity in the customer. And I\u2019d point to our C.U.E. business as an indication to that, it\u2019s comped 3 times our overall comp rate, dry dog food above 20% comps. In fact, the month of March was our highest dollar volume ever in dry dog food. If I just step back, we serve a lifestyle. It\u2019s a demand-driven need-based kind product categories for the most part and have a track record of consistency and resiliency really across all different types of economic cycles. And in addition to that track record of consistency in the demand-driven business model, two additional factors going for us now. One are the continued kind of macro tailwinds, things like world revitalization and pet adoption that I mentioned earlier, and then also our Life Out Here strategy. And with 175 garden centers, and by the end of the year, 30% of our -- nearly 30% of our stores remodel with Fusion. We just got -- we\u2019ve got a lot of tailwinds right now. And as it relates to the consumer, we\u2019ve really not seen much reaction to inflation or any other kind of economic elements. As far as the impact on inflation, to your second point of your question, I\u2019d kind of point to Kurt\u2019s comments in his prepared remarks around we did exceed our expectations in Q1. Just given the -- our historic convention of sticking to the half and also just given the macro environment, we thought it was prudent to reiterate our guidance. But certainly, if you roll through the beat in the first quarter, it would take you towards the high end of our guidance for the year. And then, if we were to exceed performance for the rest of the year, we\u2019d end up having a -- and continue to do that. We\u2019d end up having a nice year. I do think inflation continues to be persistent. And we continue to see it come through, and we continue to be able to navigate it very effectively. Operator : Next question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : I\u2019ll ask the two questions now in the interest of time. The first is the business\u2019s mix of needs versus wants. We used to talk about this a while ago. So, how do you -- how should we think about the percentage of the business that\u2019s discretionary if the consumer slows? And then, the second question is a little more tactical. If you look at the earnings complexion for the rest of the year, margins were down a little in the first quarter, but it looks like the incremental margins for the rest of the year look like they\u2019re higher given the per point in comp. So, what\u2019s, I guess, the bridge? Is there less investment? Is there a mapping up cost, et cetera? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes. Simeon, hey, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll hit both of those questions. If I understood the question, your first question generally is around needs discretionary versus a needs-based business, which we\u2019re predominantly, and then really more of a -- how do you reconcile and how do you manage the cost, the operating margin throughout the rest of the year. Our business continues to be strong in a needs-based, demand-driven versus the discretionary. And as you\u2019ve heard from us in the past, while there is some less needs-based discretionary, the discretionary piece of our business is fairly consistently been a low percentage, roughly like 15% of our business, we\u2019d attribute to those more discretionary pieces of it. And as Hal just mentioned, some of those areas we -- as we expected and saw lifts last year with stimulus, we expected and saw some of that trade-off in the back end of Q1. In regards to our outlook for the year and how we really manage the margins, we expect our gross margin as inflation persists to have some level of pressure on the business. We\u2019re going to see pressure from those three primary categories : product inflation; the supply chain costs; and even considering the strength of C.U.E. as we continue to take market share, puts a little bit of pressure from mix. But, as we manage through this, we really see the opportunity to take both levers of gross margin and SG&A. And in each quarter could be a bit different as inflation puts pressure on gross margin. We also do see the opportunity for that to help us leverage in SG&A. And in the first half of the year, where inflation year-over-year has more of an impact and not as much stronger compares, where at the back half of the year, we\u2019re really starting to see inflation tick up. You could see as you did in Q1, stronger inflation, but we have opportunity to leverage on SG&A. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to view this business. We\u2019re going to manage this as we have the last couple of years through a number of different scenarios, and we do see a scenario where there\u2019s higher inflation. And we\u2019ve got the levers to be able to manage gross margin and SG&A, and it could differ by quarters, but that\u2019s what gives us the confidence to be able to land the target for the year of 10.1% to 10.3% on the operating margin. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Kate, you may proceed. Kate McShane : Thank you again for the detail around the change in composition of the guide. I was just wondering how we should think about potentially the upside and downside risk to the guide. Where do you think there could be elements of where you could be being particularly conservative? Kurt Barton : Yes, Kate. Hey. Good morning. This is Kurt. In regards to your question on the guide, let me give you a couple of perspectives really how we see the business and how we look at it going forward. First, I\u2019ll just reiterate what Hal and I\u2019ve said. We\u2019re coming off of Q1 a great start to the year where there\u2019s a strong performance hitting on all metrics. And just to point out, Q1 on a two-year stack basis, from the strength in new customers, the strength in Neighbor\u2019s Club, our transaction toward the highest two-year stack of any of the four quarters. So, the core of the business is strong and healthy. That said, as I just mentioned earlier, it is right and consistent even in the last two years, we\u2019re managing the business in multiple scenarios. So, to your point in your question, there are various scenarios. And if under one scenario, there\u2019s inflation that drives the comps outside of even the initial expectations, with that inflation, it puts pressure on margins, the leverage and SG&A. We certainly see that with inflation. It could impact some of the transactions. We\u2019ve trip consolidation. We\u2019ve seen customers begin to change in their spending patterns with the inflation. But, that\u2019s not necessarily negative for us as we benefit in ticket and that can help us leverage our SG&A. And so, the number of various scenarios that we see playing out, we feel very comfortable that in the next three quarters as we manage that, that we can still meet our expectations and our guidance and very confident in the demand of the business and the strength right now going into the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson. Michael Baker : One question and a follow-up kind of short term and then long term. On the short term, back to --just the weather being a sub par in March, do we expect to -- so you\u2019ve lost some sales presumably. So, we should expect to gain that back in the second quarter, I assume. But, we\u2019ve seen -- how has April been in terms of the weather? And then, the longer term question. how does -- can you remind us how you think about housing and impact to your business, rate drop, housing is probably going to slow, existing home sales have been down six or seven months in a row, although prices have been up. How do you think about that longer term for your business? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Hal. And I\u2019m going to take the first -- the second part of your question first on housing and then have Seth talk a little bit about spring. On housing, we don\u2019t have as much of a direct correlation to new home starts and existing home sales, like other segments of retail. That said, one of the trends we have been benefiting from is the notion of home setting and people investing in their homes and in their land and also rural revitalization as well as we\u2019ve had kind a shift out of urban and even sub-urban areas into ex-urban and rural. I think all the data sets still suggest that those trends are continuing. Even if you look at the existing home sales and new home sales, which have come up the last few days, while there were some year-over-year reductions, still very strong absolute numbers, and then if you look at the amount of housing stock that were short in the United States, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see very strong absolute numbers for many years -- many quarters and years to come. And I think you\u2019re going to see more of that outside of the cities, and we\u2019ll continue to benefit from that. Most of our customers own their land, own their homes, and they\u2019ve seen home and land depreciation, particularly out of rural, which has had outsized gains versus urban. They\u2019re benefiting from that. There\u2019s been a bit of a wealth effect. So, certainly feel like that home stetting trend and that rural revitalization trend are still very strong macroeconomic tailwinds for us. On spring, as Kurt mentioned, we\u2019ve had a -- spring has been slow to start, but we are very excited about our spring plans. Inventory is in a great spot, marketing and merchandising, our prime, C.U.E. is driving footsteps. And I\u2019m going to turn it over to Seth to talk a little bit about some of our spring plans in more detail. Seth Estep : Yes. Hey. Thanks, Hal. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Hey, first and foremost, as Hal mentioned, obviously, a little bit of delay here to the start of spring. But as we\u2019ve seen the weather starts to break off the southern most areas the last couple of weeks, we are very encouraged with seeing our game plan come to life. First and foremost, I would just say, I was in Texas last week and visited several garden centers. And I would tell you, both our customers and our team members could not be more excited about us really going deeper into live goods and gardening, which we know it has been historically the number one category. So, we were not first in top of mind for them and becoming more of that top of mind, and we are seeing very good positive results, particularly in those garden center stores and being set up for 175 plus as we enter spring here. But it\u2019s also not just about live goods, right? We believe we have the best-in-class zero-turn lineup that\u2019s out there. We spoke a little bit about big ticket at the end of Q1. But what I would tell you is where we\u2019re seeing weather break. We\u2019re seeing very strong demand across the entire zero-turn lineup, both in brands and price point. We\u2019re -- our consumer responding with that merchandising. And we\u2019ve spoken some obviously about Greenworks Pro and that exclusive partnership that we have this year. That\u2019s a new real category that we haven\u2019t been able to attack in years past that we know that we can go and take market share. A couple of other quick things we think about spring and where we\u2019re excited to drive the business. It\u2019s not just about lawn and garden at Tractor Supply, but it\u2019s also about home setting. Chick Days is off to a great start, whether be through new coops or these through new breeds, things of that nature, really, really strong demand that we\u2019re seeing our consumer respond to and then just continue to dive into our C.U.E. related businesses and introducing newness across the four walls. So, excited about spring and what we have here in front of us and the plan coming to life. Michael Baker : Thanks for the detailed response. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is with Steven Zaccone. Steven Zaccone : I guess, Hal, I was kind of curious for your sense on the broader macro backdrop. It sounds like you\u2019re comfortable that consumers are in a healthy position, but just curious your input on how you see the consumer environment shaping up over the balance of the year? It\u2019s topical with investors. And I guess if we do get to a scenario where potentially in a recession, how do you think the business performs in that environment? Hal Lawton : Good morning, Steven, and thanks for joining our call. If we step back and just talk about the macroeconomic environment, what we\u2019re seeing is very consistent with what we\u2019re all reading in the headlines every day. I\u2019ll start with persistent inflation. We had the CPI of 8.5% in the month of March, that we\u2019ve seen 0.5 point increases a month for the last handful of months. It\u2019s tough to say if we\u2019re at peak inflation, the way I think about it is that we\u2019re seeing persistent inflation. And I think we will see, strong inflation, not only through this year, but in the next year. As it relates to the economy, so far, the consumer has shown real strength and their ability to kind of navigate the inflation. And I think you\u2019re hearing that today in our earnings call, but also hearing it in many other earnings calls that have come out over the last week, and there\u2019s a variety of reasons for that. I mean, you\u2019ve had strong wage growth across the country. You\u2019ve got $2 trillion plus of pent-up savings that people are starting to tap into now, and you can see that in savings rate. You do see a little bit of credit card usage up. But I think if you dig into that what we\u2019re seeing is people using their credit cards and then tapping into their savings to pay those down with default rates not yet moving up. I think, the consumer\u2019s navigating this very well. And I think any talk of recession at this point is premature. And stepping back, if you look at our business, we\u2019ve had 30 straight years of positive comp transactions. We\u2019ve had 30 straight years of net sales growth, 29 of the last 30, we\u2019ve had positive comp sales growth. This is a business that has been able to navigate all types of economic cycles, whether it was the recession in \u201820, the recession in 2007, \u201808, \u201809, whether it was COVID, just a couple of years ago. All those sorts of scenarios, this business has been incredibly resilient, stable and consistent through. And as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s a number of macroeconomic tailwinds that are really benefiting us that I think even accentuate the stability of our business. And then combine that with our Life Out Here strategy, which is just an indicative of just the next leg of growth for our company. And 40 years ago, we doubled down in animal fee, 20 years ago, we doubled down in pet food. Now, we\u2019re doubling down in live goods combined with our Fusion remodel. We\u2019ve never had more customers shopping Tractor Supply. We\u2019ve never had a stronger digital business at Tractor Supply. Our business is incredibly strong right now. And we are very much excited about the business from a short-term perspective and long-term. Operator : Our next question is with Brian Nagel. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. I have two short questions that I\u2019ll merge into one. The first question, I mean, I guess this is just more of a kind of a logistics, not question. But you talk about the quarter tracking above your expectations, but then also some of the weather pressures. So, I guess, my question there is, were you -- in your internal plan, were you planning for potentially more challenging weather, or -- what drove, so to say, the upside in the quarter to your tier internal plans. And then my second question, we talked a lot about of this inflation and how the consumer is managing that. Kind of flipping that over, as you look at some of your markets where maybe you\u2019re more of a benefit of -- your consumers benefit more from higher oil prices or higher commodity prices? Are you starting to see that sort of say, work its way into the health of your -- the consumer shop in your stores? Kurt Barton : Yes, Brian. Hey, good morning. This is Kurt. So, the two questions, one in regards to some of the puts and takes in regards to our -- in comparison to our expectations on Q1; and then, the other one is some of the geo market areas such as oil industry et cetera. So, let me take both of those. In the quarter, in Q1, weather from a perspective compared to last year, flattish to slightly modestly unfavorable. The point there is, last year we pointed, we had such an early start to the spring, and March is the biggest month that we saw 400 basis points last year in Q1 for weather and we pointed that out. This year, we had early start to the quarter with good cold weather in January that we benefited from, but then we had the offset. So, weather was neutralish from a perspective. Really some of the strengths came in how well C.U.E. performed and our ability to continue to capture market share. So, weather wasn\u2019t necessarily beyond -- significantly beyond our expectations. We plan that there could be a scenario that we would not see as much early start to the spring. I hope that helps on that. In regards to some of the various micro economies, all that, the two key ones that are asked a lot about oil industry, farm economy. In summary, I\u2019d say right now, it\u2019s still too early to tell. We are not seeing any meaningful shift in those markets that indicate anything. And I\u2019ll illustrate why on some of that. First, we don\u2019t view some of the rise in commodities or oil necessarily as a negative in those industries, but yes, really more of a potential favorable tailwind in the business. Right now, the oil industry is a bit patient, lagging some of the growth and increase in the oil prices. The farm economy takes some time farmers to get product out of the ground. Farmers are faced with higher input costs right now. So, I think it\u2019s a matter of something to watch. Overall, those markets are very healthy and consistent with all other markets. We\u2019ll watch it closely, but we\u2019re certainly ready and prepared to support those industries if and when we begin to see specific lifts because of that. Brian Nagel : It\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is with Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : Two questions. So one, I guess, the first one is in terms of inflation for the year, what is your actual updated expectation on inflation for the year? And then, embedded within that, on traffic, your traffic was only down 1% with 10% inflation. But on a two- and three-year basis, more or less held. So, could you just clarify how you\u2019re thinking about traffic for the remainder of the year, because presumably, inflation will abate, so that should actually help the traffic overall on a one-, two- and three-year basis? Hal Lawton : Thanks for joining our call and for the question. On inflation in our enhanced earnings, we mentioned that our assumption was around 4% for the year, but that if anything, we saw a potential for upside to that. And that\u2019s very much what we saw in the quarter. And we\u2019re not providing kind of an update on that 4% number today, but I would say that potential for upside there still remains. Kind of my comment to an earlier question around inflation being persistent, I do think it will continue through the balance of the year and run at 4% or higher. On the traffic, we were very pleased with the traffic in the quarter that we had, and it exceeded our expectations. To your point on two- and three-year stacks, it was either in line or above sequentially and with our previous quarters. And in particular, if you think about the stimulus benefits from last year, but certainly, the spring differences, the weather differences in the month of March, we were very pleased with how our comp transactions ran. And we\u2019ve never had more customers shopping Tractor Supply than we have on a rolling 12 basis. We\u2019ve done an excellent job of maintaining the tens of millions of new customers that have shopped us over the last two years. Our active customer file is incredibly strong. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club membership program, members have never been higher. The participation, active participation in the Neighbor\u2019s Club program has never been higher. So, we feel really good about our customer trajectory, our transaction trajectory within those customers and our customers kind of navigating inflation in our business kind of in a demand-driven need-based type environment. Karen Short : Can I just clarify? It was only in the context that I think Kurt made a comment that traffic would continue to be pressured in light of -- or would be pressured in light of inflation, but that\u2019s not [Technical Difficulty] I just want to clarify, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re seeing. Hal Lawton : Yes. I think, to clarify, I think what we\u2019re trying to articulate there was there\u2019s a variety of scenarios that could play out for the balance of the year. And one of those could be that inflation continues to run high. And if so, that might drive some different behavior in customer shopping patterns, notably that they might consolidate trips more. And if they do that, what we might see is a higher basket size with slightly lower transactions. And we just -- we\u2019re saying, look, that\u2019s one scenario that could play out and still very much within the context of our guidance. And then, the same thing on the margin profile side, kind of the point is more around if inflation still runs high, we might see a little bit more pressure than what we had guided on gross margin rates, still excellent margin rate performance, but we see a little bit less pressure on SG&A because our fixed costs would be running on higher sales dollars and that would still deliver us the operating margin rate in the -- in line -- in the range of our guidance. And we\u2019re very pleased with our operating margin performance in the first quarter. We really, as Kurt mentioned, exceeded our expectations across all core metrics, traffic, sales and operating margin and EPS. Operator : Our next question is with Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : There\u2019s a heightened focus on big ticket spending, given some of the indications from others out there around connected fitness equipment, grills, mattresses. Your suggestion is that overall to your big ticket trends are doing better than average, and that\u2019s inclusive of what sounds like a drop-off in the last two weeks of the quarter, which persisted into the first few weeks of this quarter. So, what is driving the strength in big ticket growth for Tractor Supply? And how much is inflation contributing to that growth? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Good morning. And thanks for the question, Michael. I\u2019d say, probably three things on that to kind of break big ticket up a bit. There are -- we saw fall-off in big ticket sales directly attributable to stimulus, very much in line with what we expected. And those were in non-seasonal categories dominantly, things like gun safes. In the seasonal businesses, big ticket, as Seth mentioned, where we\u2019ve seen the spring weather break, we\u2019ve seen excellent results in things like riders and grills, bigger ticket items. And then, as it relates to inflation, we certainly are seeing inflation in those categories, like we\u2019re seeing across the board. But I would say that we\u2019re also pleased with our unit movement in those categories, not just sales driven by inflation. So, overall, we continue to be -- feel very confident in our business short term and long term, inclusive of big ticket. And we\u2019re excited about the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good morning. Hal, Seth, I wanted to start with your in-market learnings, right? As it looks like you\u2019ve both been on the road recently. So, can you take us through some of your key learnings? And what I mean by that is really the learnings from the store associates. What are they saying about their own behaviors? And did you notice anything different among the regions that you visited, maybe outside of seasonal trends? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Steven, thanks for the question. And we have all been on the road a lot recently, making sure it\u2019s a core tenant of Tractor Supply\u2019s mission and values and our culture. And I think our team is in great shape. John Ordus and our field organization have just done a fantastic job in hiring. We\u2019re nearly 47,000 team members now, done an excellent job managing attrition. We\u2019ve -- our FAST team continues to roll out to more stores in terms of kind of dedicated FAST team members. We\u2019re rolling out new productivity programs, as John outlined in our last earnings call. If you walk our stores right now, they\u2019ve never been in better shape. They -- we\u2019ve got great service in our stores right now. Product is well-organized and on the shelves. We\u2019ve got -- they\u2019re very clean and orderly. We\u2019ve got really all of the assembly done across Grills and all across riders, and we are ready for spring, ready for the second quarter. And then, in terms of engagement, our store -- we had our engagement survey towards the end of last year. Our store team member engagement was at an all-time high. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re doing an excellent job managing attrition and -- our team members are really the glue of our company. And we pride ourselves on the customer service that we deliver inside of our stores. And I think we\u2019re only continuing to make progress on that even at an already high level. And I think it\u2019s going to be a big benefit to us as we move into -- as we are in the second quarter now. Operator : Our next question is from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Kurt, can you provide a sense for how you see the rest of the year playing out on the comp front in order to arrive at that 3% to 4.5% full year view, particularly here in the second quarter, just given the upside here that you posted for 1Q? And then, on the stores front, can you talk about your confidence levels to open up the 75 to 80 stores, given that you weren\u2019t able to open up any here in 1Q? Kurt Barton : Yes. Thanks for the questions, two of them there. I\u2019ll just reiterate what Hal and I have talked about in regards to the comp performance and how that plays out for the year. Certainly, as we exceeded our expectation or coming off of strong Q1 performance, as you roll that through the year. And we\u2019ll continue to say as we have the last two years, we are managing this business through multiple scenarios. You could have comp sales at the high end of our guidance range. It\u2019s one quarter into the year as we see the rest of the year. We\u2019ve got good momentum in the business. And so, as you play that out, we recognize that as you flow this through, this could be towards the high end of our guidance range. And as we\u2019ve even indicated, it\u2019s early to predict on levels of inflation, but as inflation persists, it even puts upward pressure on that. And at this point, the best we can do is tell you how we view the business and how we\u2019re managing that. And then, in regards to our new store openings, I\u2019ll start by saying we are -- we have no concerns in regards to opening of new stores. We have confidence in our ability to hit our 70 to 80 stores this year. We\u2019ve got a solid track record of opening 70, 80 stores. Our process is solid. Our pipeline for new stores is really strong right now. And construction is not exempt from some of the challenges of supply chain, labor, et cetera. We put a lot of effort and to complete the 80 stores in the fourth quarter. And some of those scenarios that push stores out, we saw some in Q1 as well. And as those stores have been pushed out of Q1-- by the way, Q1 is our -- typically our smallest quarter of new stores. Those stores will open up in Q2, Q3. We still have a real strong pipeline and expect to hit our targets this year for new stores. Mary Winn Pilkington : Austin, if we keep at the top of the hour, maybe we\u2019ll take one more question in and then wrap up our call after the next question, please. Operator : Of course. Our final question will be from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. When you look at strong level of C.U.E. sales in the first quarter, is there -- as a percent of total, is there something else going on besides stimulus spending? And how is that mix shaping up thus far into the second quarter? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Chuck, how are you? And thank you for joining the call today. On C.U.E., I would attribute our strong growth to taking share. As we talked about in our enhanced earnings event, on a two-year stack, our total sales grew 52% relative to the market at 25%, which meant we grew -- outgrew the market by 27 points, significant share gain. And that is -- we\u2019re the market leader in animal feed. We\u2019re one of the market leaders in pet food and we are gaining significant share in both of those categories. It\u2019s attributable to our business model, our customer service, our Life Out Here strategy, and so we\u2019re -- that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re just really excited about C.U.E. and the footsteps that\u2019s driving into our stores and the setup that has for us for the balance of the year. Mary Winn Pilkington : This completes our call today. We look forward to talking to you at our second quarter earnings call in July. Both Marianne and I are around today. So, please feel free to reach out. But thank you very much for joining our call today. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Tractor Supply as we delivered record results on both sales and earnings. I would like to begin by thanking the 48,000 plus Tractor Supply team members for once again delivering impressive performance through strong execution and for their dedication to serving life out here. Our business continues to be incredibly stable and resilient. This quarter, the team did an excellent job managing inflationary impacts operating through continued supply chain disruption and navigating the evolving consumer demand. We continue to win with our customers and took substantial share in the quarter. We entered the back half of the year with our inventory on plan and excellent visibility into our expense base. We remain very confident in our growth outlook and our Life Out Here strategy. Structural tailwinds continue to benefit us, including rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership. Our brand, loyalty program, digital capabilities, supply chain and 2,000 plus stores create significant enduring advantages for us and our strategic initiatives are all on track and reaching scale. Now, let\u2019s turn to a review of the business for the second quarter of 2022. In many ways, the second quarter was a mirror image of Q1. The quarter started off slow as April was pressured from cycling stimulus and the delayed start of spring. May was our strongest month. June was solid and modestly above the quarter\u2019s comp in spite of record-breaking heat, which has continued into Q3 and will limit the sales upside in the current quarter. We grew net sales by 8.4%, with comparable store sales up 5.5%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7.5%, offset by a decline in transactions of 2%. We experienced positive comp sales growth for each of the last 9 weeks of the quarter. Comp transactions were positive for the months of May and June combined. Diluted EPS was $3.53, an increase of 10.7%. Year-round categories were up high single-digits, indicative of our demand-driven, needs-based business model. The impressive results in our consumable, usable and edible categories continued this quarter as the business performed more than 3x our overall sales growth rate. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of C.U.E. outperforming our overall results. Our seasonal performance was below the company average, but positive. Big ticket was flat to last year and exceeded our expectations given that we were cycling strong performance last year driven by stimulus and ideal weather for the spring and summer season. We had strength in zero-term mowers, chicken coops, battery-operated outdoor power equipment and grills, with the biggest declines coming from frontage and mowers, log splitters and walk-behind mowers. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club reached a record 26 million members in the quarter. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance. We are seeing strong growth in industry-leading retention in our high-value customers. Our team members\u2019 commitment to providing legendary service continues to differentiate the shopping experience within our stores. As a proof point, our customers\u2019 overall satisfaction scores were at the highest level ever for a second quarter. We are successfully scaling our store real estate and remodel projects. To-date, we have over 400 stores in the Project Fusion format. We have over 230 stores with garden centers, more than 100 stores with store than the store Carhartts and over 600 stores with a pet wash. These are all improvements that make Tractor Supply a more contemporary, relevant, farm and ranch-oriented retailer. These improvements are allowing us to gain share with you and existing customers. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Although the operating environment maybe different than we anticipated as we entered the year, we are pleased with how we are navigating the various circumstances and remain very confident in the significant opportunities ahead of us. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through varying economic conditions. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here Lifestyle and they prioritize it. Our customers\u2019 over-indexes, homeowners, landowners, animal owners and pet owners, we believe that the structural macro trends that I mentioned earlier are long-term and sustainable. As the market leader, we have substantial advantages. Additionally, our investments in our Life Out Here strategy are reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Tractor Supply has never been stronger. Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to welcome Kimberly Gardner as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Kimberly succeeds Christi Korzekwa, who announced her retirement earlier this year. Kimberly brings an extensive background in marketing with a data-driven approach to brand development that I believe will continue the evolution of our marketing organization and continue to build on the strength of the Tractor Supply brand. Our appreciation and thanks go to Christi for her leadership and dedication over the last decade at Tractor Supply. Now, I will turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the second quarter and our financial outlook for the rest of the year. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal and hello to everyone on the call. At the halfway mark for the year, the Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. We are very pleased with the consistency and the strength of our top line performance. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. We continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting our vendor partners. Comp transactions declined 2.0%, which was slightly below our expectations. As. we anticipated pressure from cycling the benefits of stimulus in the prior year. We experienced incremental headwinds from the delayed start to the spring and the drought conditions in the latter part of the quarter. Complementing the commentary Hal shared on the cadence of the quarter, all regions of the country delivered positive sales comps, the geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. We did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the drought. In particular, the Far West and Texhoma regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. The South Central and South Atlantic were our best-performing regions. Turning to our digital performance. The second quarter represented our largest e-commerce quarter in net sales ever. On the back of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, our e-commerce grew approximately 7%. Excluding April, we had solid performance with double-digit sales for May and June combined. Our mobile app continues to ramp with double-digit growth and represented about 15% of total digital sales in the quarter. Petsense continues to perform well with comp sales growth above the company average. Turning now to gross margin. For the second quarter, our gross margin declined by 24 basis points to 35.5% of sales. This was primarily attributable to three factors : significant product cost inflation, higher transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, product mix given the robust growth in C.U.E. products. We continue to experience broad-based inflation. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. As we shared last quarter, we expect many of these inflationary trends to continue into the second half of 2022. I continue to give the team a lot of credit for the remarkable job they are doing. Between tracking and forecasting freight and the coordination of retail price increases at the store level, they have been nimble. The team has effectively managed these cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor\u2019s Club. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales, was 22.1%, an improvement of 19 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to more normalized incentive compensation and the moderation of COVID-19 response costs as well as leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and our strategic growth initiatives, which includes a step up in our depreciation and amortization. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, operating profit margin was essentially flat, contracting by only 4 basis points. Net income improved 7.1% to $397 million and diluted EPS increased 10.7% to $3.53. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned $291 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and higher cash dividends. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through the first 6 months of the year to $691 million. Turning to our balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. Consistent with the first quarter, this increase is primarily attributable to inflation. We believe the quality and the composition of our inventory is excellent and that we are in great shape as we go into the second half of the year. If anything, we are pursuing more inventory as there are categories we are working to improve our in-stock position. To provide more clarity on this, on a 3-year basis, our units per store inventory has increased single-digits, while sales are up over 60%. Moving now to our updated guidance for 2022, which is detailed in our press release we issued this morning. We are raising our financial outlook for the year given our strong performance year-to-date, as Hal mentioned earlier. This now includes net sales in the range of $13.95 billion to $14.05 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5.2% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating profit margin around 10.2%. This represents the midpoint of our previous guidance of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. While higher costs have handicapped some upside, at the same time, we believe we are able to mitigate pressures on the downside. Diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $9.48 to $9.60 compared to our prior guidance of $9.20 to $9.50. Please note that our fiscal 2022 guidance includes a benefit for the 53rd week, which is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percentage points of net sales and $0.15 of diluted EPS. As you model the second half of the year, let me address two items. First, for both the third and fourth quarters, we would anticipate that our comp sales growth would be consistent with our first half of the year. As Hal mentioned earlier, the extreme heat and drought conditions are continuing into the third quarter and we forecast these conditions will limit upside to sales. Second, I want to address the cadence of operating profit. We anticipate the earnings cadence between Q3 and Q4 to be more in line with historical trends. For operating profit margin in the second half of the year, we forecast flat to slight contraction. The performance in the fourth quarter is forecast to be positive year-over-year, with the third quarter experiencing some contraction. The variation between the quarters is predominantly a function of gross margin. Specifically, the third quarter will experience greater mix pressures from the strength we are seeing in C.U.E. and higher transportation costs. Both of these factors we first experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Store compares naturally ease in the fourth quarter. For the second half of the year, we expect inflation to be consistent at an elevated level. With as much inflation pressure we are seeing in our business, we continue to closely watch comparable average ticket and transactions. In times of rising inflation, we anticipate that the breakdown of comp sales growth will trend to higher ticket performance from inflation offset by transactions. The impact on transactions is pronounced this year, especially as we lap the prior year\u2019s benefit from stimulus. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update soon. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and our outlook for 2022. The resiliency of our business has been proven over time. We have an amazing track record of navigating the challenges of the external environment. As evidenced by our ongoing market share gains, the team is executing at a very high level. Our financial outlook for the year is delivering on the key drivers of our long-term algorithm that we shared in January, accelerated sales growth, strong earnings and increased cash return to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Okay. So, now let\u2019s review some of the growth drivers for Tractor Supply to capture the significant opportunity we see ahead of us. As previously mentioned, with a total addressable market of $180 billion, our Life Out Here strategy positions us well to capture the market share. First, Project Fusion and Garden Center initiatives are two key growth drivers of our strategy and they are designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. We are on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year end. Our multiyear plan to renovate existing stores allows us to improve the shopping experience for our customers with a revitalized layout and expanded offerings. The changes are resonating with our customers and our team members. As of today, we have over 230 garden centers that are up and running. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the year end. Over the spring and summer selling seasons, our stores with a garden center significantly outperformed the chain average and are on track with our business case. The expanded assortment of live goods is resonating not only with existing customers, but is a key asset to attracting new customers that skew female and younger. The garden centers have allowed us to gain share and will continue to play a significant role in our merchandising plans across the seasons. As the number one seller of bag feed and a top five retailer in pet food, it is critical that we are able to deliver for our customers as the dependable supplier in these C.U.E. categories. These are destination categories for us that drive trips. Our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on C.U.E. as we work to ensure we not only have capacity for future growth that maintains the lowest cost to serve. To support our store growth and increased demand, our ninth distribution center located in Navarra, Ohio is on track to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, we are targeting the top 180 most challenged stores to implement a full suite of resources, which would include things like a feed room, mixing center allocations, high-volume store racking and much more. To-date, our process improvements have been executed across about 50% of our targeted stores. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the improved operations at these stores. With the success of our Fusion and Garden Center projects, growth in our Neighbor\u2019s Club, the increased volume, velocity and variety of C.U.E. products moving through our supply chain in stores allows us to leverage our scale and sophistication to widen our position in farm and ranch. Mobile engagement is a moat that we are creating around our business. We are well on our way to converting our 26 million Neighbor\u2019s Club members into power users of our app. We are currently ahead of our year-to-date goals for our mobile app downloads. With new offers and features like the My Pet mobile app personalization, we are able to differentiate our digital shopping experience and capture growth opportunities. Whether online or in stores, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the change from summer to fall with our customers. Innovation and newness resonate with our customers and our merchant team as exciting plans to capitalize on our customer needs. Our customers count on us for brands that have the durability to get the job done and clothing is no exception. For instance, our lineup of apparel, workwear and accessories includes leading brands like Carhartt, Wrangler and Columbia as well as our exclusive brand, Ridgecut. Ridgecut has resonated with our customers and has allowed for our assortment expansion to include footwear and women\u2019s clothing. From insulated outerwear, hoodies, long-sleeved T-shirts, boots and more, our apparel products focus on the demand-driven workwear categories. In truck tool and hardware, our annual event ultimate workshop, will be in stores in the coming weeks and will be bigger than ever. More than 700 stores now have an improved tool coral. Our lineup of relevant brands like Porter Cable exclusively at Tractor Supply, the expansion of Makita and strong brands like Bosch and DeWalt makes our ultimate workshop sales event more relevant. The event offers great value on the brands our customers need to outfit their workshop or garage. We also have a new strategic partnership with Interstate Battery that we will roll out in the fourth quarter. Interstate Battery has a proven track record and is the largest battery distribution network in the United States that will allow us to better serve our stores. Branded as traveler by Interstate Battery, we will have a great lineup that is relevant all with improved in-stocks and reliability. In our seasonal business, we anticipate that this will be a strong heating season given the elevated energy costs.

At the same time, we believe we have visibility into our cost and are managing our inventory to customer demand. We are winning with our customers with significant growth and market share opportunities, it remains an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Elizabeth, your line is open. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thank you so much. So first, just regarding transportation costs, do you think we\u2019re getting past peak cost pressure? And do you have any expectations that transportation costs could become a tailwind going into next year? Hal Lawton : Hey, Liz, how are you? This is Hal. Thanks so much for the question and for joining the call. On transportation costs, break it down into a couple of different buckets. First off, spot rates for both import products, the container spot rates as well as spot rates for domestic are trending down and starting to reach kind of averages levels for last year and in some cases, below. That said, the flip side is the vast majority of our business for both domestic and imports are done on contracts. And the contracts that we are in this year are at higher rates than they were last year. So kind of when you kind of look at it all, it all kind of blends to about the same number. So as we get in towards the back half of the year, we do expect some of the pressure to moderate. But I don\u2019t anticipate a tailwind on transportation costs for 12 to 18 months. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. And just one quick follow-up on imports, I mean your actual import percentage is pretty small as a percent of total product, but do you expect to see any \u2013 would you expect to see any impact gross margin if tariffs on goods from China roll off? Kurt Barton : Liz, hi, this is Kurt. Yes, we have imports at around 12% of our business just for the full group as a reminder. And back when the China tariffs were put into place, I mean, we had some product having the tariffs in there. If there were to be reverse of those tariffs, that would be a benefit to us. We managed well when putting \u2013 managing through the increase in the tariffs. And then, of course, with imports, do keep in mind that, that product has a longer lead time. Those costs have to work through the system. So similar to almost the explanation that you heard from Hal on transportation, any shift in tariffs would take 6, 9, 12 months to really see playing through the inventory and cost of goods sold. And as any changes in a tariff environment changes. Certainly, we will update our guidance. And it is generally a benefit to us as we can get some relief from those tariffs that have had to be baked into the cost over the last few years. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is with Steven Forbes from Guggenheim. Steven, your line is open. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Hal and Kurt. Maybe, Hal, I wanted to focus on how Tractor is addressing the internal cultural and what agent befit needs of its team members in the current inflationary environment. And if you can maybe highlight some of your learnings from the annual sales meeting as it pertains to what your team members are asking for and what they are sort of speaking as to their customer needs. Hal Lawton : Good morning, Steve, how are you? And thanks for joining our call. I\u2019d start with the culture at Tractor Supply is foundational for us. Our mission and values are our number one priority. And we are constantly looking for ways to make deposits in our culture and continue to build on it. And as you mentioned, our annual sales meeting, which was just last week is one big way that we do that. As it relates to kind of the investments we made in the team, we\u2019re proud of the investments we\u2019ve made in our team, in particular over the last couple of years. And they range from wage investments to bonus enhancements and improvements and to broader rollouts of benefits and not just healthcare benefits, but additional items like tuition reimbursement, paternity leave, etcetera. And those have been substantial in their monetary both at an individual level and also material in terms of investment on the overall company level. And we are committed to paying a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work. That said, we look forward \u2013 we do think that the majority of that investment is behind us. We feel good about where we are from a market perspective on a relative basis. We\u2019re seeing retention rates well below 2019 levels. We\u2019re seeing excellent engagement scores with our team members. And we feel really good about our culture and our morale and our team as we head into the back half of the year. We have a track record of consistency and resiliency in all different economic environments. And that\u2019s one of the things that I do anticipate that as the economy becomes a little tougher and we start to see the labor market ease and layoffs occurring that there will be a flight to quality. And I think that will be a really good thing for Tractor Supply and allow us to further improve our retention and attract high-quality talent just given the resiliency and stability of our business and our commitment to our team members and culture. Steven Forbes : Thank you. I will keep it to one. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Kate, your line is open. Kate McShane : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Kurt, I think in your commentary you mentioned that you\u2019re trying to reduce promotion, which is counter to what we\u2019re hearing across retail. So I wanted to see if there were any more details around that. And just with regards to margin and preserving margin, has there been any effort to push some of the cost back on to vendors? Or has there been any effort to push for more sharing of costs as we\u2019ve seen with other retailers? Seth Estep : Hi, Kate, this is Seth. Thank you for the question. First question there on kind of what Kurt talked about in the prepared remarks on promotional activity, over the course of the last 2, 2.5 years, we\u2019ve put a concerted effort on really going to our true north as an EDLP retailer. And we\u2019re committed to driving \u2013 to stay towards the course of being an EDLP retailer. Fundamentally, we are not planning adding additional promotion to our strategy. And with that, it goes to the quality, I think, of our inventory position and also the ability now for us to leverage the 26 million-plus members in our Neighbor\u2019s Club database so that we can very strategically go after our shoppers and our customers to drive those sales, market share and obviously protect margin as well there. For your second question around cost push-backs, the short answer would be yes. We are definitely working with our vendor partners and conversations proactively planning across the supply chain, cost of goods as well as building on things like our exclusive brand programs that we know that we can drive incredible value, create loyalty, drive market share. And in many ways this also typically carry higher gross margins for us as well. So at the current time, I mean, we\u2019re staying to our true north in promotion as well as definitely looking to push back on costs that are flowing through the system at the same time. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Scot, your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So I think in the prepared comments, Hal, you talked about evolving demand and a different operating environment than what you expected at the beginning of the year. But it doesn\u2019t sound like the business has changed a whole lot. So can you provide any more color maybe on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of recent trends that kind of made you make that comment? Hal Lawton : Yes. Good morning. And thanks, Scot, for the question and for joining the call. I\u2019d say at the highest level, our business just continues to be incredibly resilient, stable and consistent kind of week-to-week, day-to-day. And we\u2019ve got a portfolio of geographies. So at times when certain geographies are seeing unfavorable weather, we will see favorable weather elsewhere. We\u2019re seeing some balance of that as it averages across. I\u2019d also point to the strength of our C.U.E. business and the fact that it is the fifth consecutive quarter it\u2019s performed at these elevated levels. Categories like dog, dry food, we\u2019re taking significant share. That business is running mid-double-digit unit comps well into the mid-20% on sales dollar comp. We\u2019re also seeing similar strength in poultry feed and equine feed. And those businesses are demand-driven, need based. They drive the traffic into our stores. And so with that and then the rest of the business, we\u2019ve been really good at evolving with consumer demand in a pretty quick way, leaning into categories that are going well, like grilling, moderating in certain categories where like frontage and riders where we need to. And the team has just done an excellent job navigating that kind of evolving consumer demand having the right inventory at the right place at the right time. And as Seth mentioned, the quality of our inventory, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we\u2019re ending our inventory on plan at the end of the quarter. And we just we feel really good about inventory. And if anything, we\u2019d like to have more of it in some of our C.U.E. categories. But I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s just the strength of Tractor Supply in our business model is the demand-driven, need-based consistency of the business. If I go back in history, 30 years plus now of positive revenue growth, 30 years of consecutive of positive comp transactions, 29 of 30 of positive sales comp dollars. And it\u2019s just the consistency of the business and the strength of the team to be able to navigate these evolving consumer demand that gives us the confidence in our \u2013 in raising our outlook for the year and also the consistency of the first half performance. Scot Ciccarelli : So just to clarify, Hal, like so you\u2019re not seeing incremental weakness somewhere where maybe you\u2019re being surprised and that wasn\u2019t the reference to evolving demand. Hal Lawton : Yes. I\u2019d say as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the business has continued to evolve this year as consumer demand has evolved. Certainly, as we mentioned on big ticket, it was flattish for the second quarter. Now, that\u2019s on top of 40% comps from last year, so really still elevated sales levels compared to multiple years ago. But in there, we have some categories that were very strong, grilling and safe as examples. But then we had other categories that were below expectations, but those all netted to be right in line with what we thought. And so we\u2019re not seeing a precipitous drop off anywhere, just the continued evolution as you always have in the business and maybe a little bit more faster evolving just given the market dynamics that we\u2019ve all been operating in over the last 2 or 3 years, really. But nothing of concern or material weakness or anything like that. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Chuck, your line is open. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Nice quarter. Kurt, I think you mentioned a 21% increase in inventory per store. Could you review what time period that covered? And does that indicate perhaps that you still have some shelf price adjustments to do to catch up with that? And how much of that inventory might be to make sure you have things in stock that are hard for your supply chain to get a hold of? Kurt Barton : Good morning, Chuck, yes, thank you for the question. In regards to our inventory position, the additional comments I can give to you in addition to the prepared remarks, our inventory as of the end of the second quarter, there is a 21% growth year-over-year compared to second quarter of last year. I\u2019ll share just a few other color commentary on it. That is a very similar year-over-year growth that we had at Q1. Our average inventory per store is actually slightly down compared to the first quarter numbers, but very similar on a year-over-year basis. A majority of our inventory growth is inflation, and that inflation has been baked into it. There is some inflation we expect to continue in the business. I think the most important point is what you\u2019ve heard from Seth and Hal and I now is that the merchant team did an excellent job recognizing that some of the demand from last year that was stimulus driven, we were wise in regards to managing the supply chain and the purchasing. The inventory is in a healthy position. There is some more on the consumables side we are working to get more of to improve our in-stock position, but we feel very good about it. And as I mentioned, unit growth over the last 3 years is single digits, while our sales have been growing at 60%. And I think that\u2019s a really important point is that we\u2019re growing the inventory modestly, and our turns are in great shape. Chuck Cerankosky : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Peter, your line is open. Peter Keith : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So great results. I was hoping you could just talk about the new customers you\u2019ve acquired over the last 2 years with COVID. It does seem like the rest of the channel feels like that customer has exited their stores. So if you feel like you\u2019re retaining them, maybe you could talk about some of the strategies you\u2019ve implemented. And secondarily, is there any risk on some of these poultry customers that have come in, we\u2019ve heard that a short-lived hobby and maybe those customers could roll off a little more quickly? Hal Lawton : Hey, Peter, how are you today? Thanks so much for the question. I\u2019d start out by saying we estimate our market was roughly flat on a dollar basis for Q2. And therefore, we took substantial share in the quarter. And our new customers that we\u2019ve acquired over the last couple of years are certainly contributing to that share growth, in addition to just share of wallet gain that we\u2019ve had with our kind of core customer. And I\u2019d point to categories \u2013 a few different categories on that. First off, I\u2019d point to dry dog food and the numbers I gave earlier on unit growth and sales dollar growth. And those are well above the market run rate right now. Similarly, on poultry, now a very large business for us with continued growth. This is the third year now of substantial growth in poultry. And each year, we\u2019re seeing the customers that engage in the category last year reengage at very high retention rates. In fact, one of the highest retention rates that we have in our C.U.E. business. And then we\u2019re also seeing significant new customers entering the category. And that category, not only is it kind of an outdoor hobby and activity, but it also has a big element of kind of self-reliance. With rising inflation and cost, you can have a meat bird in 3 months, have an egg layer in 4 months. And we\u2019re seeing people invest in their flocks currently, not only just for the notion of kind of rural revitalization, but also really in the spirit of kind of self-reliance. I\u2019d also point to live goods. We\u2019ve made a significant investment in our garden centers over the last 2 years and exiting Q2 with 230 garden centers. And over 10% of our chain now has a garden center. Live goods, has been now grown into a material business for us. And it\u2019s attracted a more female customer as well as a younger customer into our business and really helped us \u2013 and given us kind of that next kind of demand-driven need-based transaction driver in our stores. So, we feel really good about our customer retention, how we have engaged with the customers over the last 2 years and we are holding on to them. And the last thing I would point to is our Neighbor\u2019s Club now, it\u2019s 26 million members, comprising well over 70% of our sales. Retention rate is still running well above 80%. And our largest tier and one of our fastest-growing tier is retention rate above 95%. So, I feel really good about the state of our customer and start and I will close with, as I mentioned at the beginning, we took substantial share in the quarter, which has been a consistent trend over the last 2 years, 2.5 years. Peter Keith : Very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is with Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is open. Zach Fadem : Hey. Good morning. Hal and Kurt, we started to see some underlying commodity prices roll over a bit. So first, could you talk to your expectations around the inflation change today relative to your last quarter outlook? And then assuming we do see some gradual moderation here, can you help me think through how slowing commodity prices could help your business and in what ways could it negatively impact your business? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Good morning. On inflation, I would start by just saying it continues to be persistent and consistent. Certainly, seeing some moderation, if you look at a few of the metrics, fuel costs, slightly down, spot rates on containers, down a bit, commodities moderating, but still, if you look at even on a year-over-year basis and certainly on a 2-year and 3-year basis, kind of record highs. And I think there is a lot of debate in the industry right now and whether or not some of the reduced prices around corn and wheat are going to hold, or whether it\u2019s just a temporary lull that will go back up as we start to look at the crop yields and demand towards the back half of the year. I think the thing we are both watching at a very high macro level is PPI. And PPI has got to come down first, just generically speaking, across retail before CPI is going to come down. And it\u2019s going to take \u2013 because retailers got to turn through their higher cost inventory for two months, three months, four months at a minimum before you start to see any reduction on the CPI retail side. So, I think inflation is going to hold and continue to be consistent really through the CPI kind of retail level, certainly through the balance of this year. Zach Fadem : Thanks Hal. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is with Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Jonathan, your line is open. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the topic of tariffs, Kurt, you mentioned it would be a P&L benefit under a rollback scenario. Just to be clear, would all of these costs flow through to gross margin, or would you look to pare back pricing on some SKUs that were impacted? I think some retailers have indicated they would look to reinvest in pricing to drive market share. It seems unlikely for other retailers. So, I just wanted to be clear on where Tractor Supply would be in terms of pricing changes under that scenario. Thanks so much. Kurt Barton : Yes. Jonathan, this is Kurt. In regards to tariffs, I will address part of it first. I will let Seth talk about pricing and how we would address that. But let me frame up the size of it and the timing of it. So, for instance, just referencing back that imports are roughly 12% of our business. Not all of those imports are subjected to tariffs. So, you are talking single-digit percentage of our business. And when tariffs were enacted, it\u2019s over \u2013 it was over a 12-month, 18-month period of time that it flowed through. And we view it and you have to manage it very much like it\u2019s another form of inflation. And as it flows through our model, we then have to address how we are going to be able to manage our margins, whether it\u2019s retail price or any other levers that we pull through that. And because it\u2019s single-digit percentage of it, do keep in mind this \u2013 we never really called it out over those periods of time as a margin headwind. And we would manage it like other levels of inflation where we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a significant headwind. We managed it as a needs-based business fairly well, not necessarily a notable margin gain either, but we believe we will manage through that as any tariff adjustments occur. Seth, I will turn it over to you to talk about pricing strategy. Seth Estep : Yes. Hey. Thanks Kurt. Thanks Jonathan for the question. I would just say in terms of pricing relative to tariffs, as Kurt mentioned, I mean our direct import business is about 12%. But at the same time, we utilize more of a kind of a broad-based portfolio strategy when we come to our pricing strategies. Our team has incredible tools in place, great visibility into moving average cost, a lot of forecasting together. And I would just say that we use every lever of the pricing strategy just to manage and land our total business, whether that be relative to tariffs, whether that be to total cost, whether it be promo, whether it be clearance. The team really does strategize just to make sure that we are hitting the right price on the right categories. We are positioned to take market share and just utilizing the tools that we have in place and the visibility to land where we need to land. So, it\u2019s more of a broad portfolio strategy approach when we come to pricing and it\u2019s just one of the levers that we look at and utilize to make sure that we are hitting our targets that we need. Jonathan Matuszewski : Got it. Thanks for the color Kurt and Seth. Kurt Barton : Yes. Thanks Jonathan. Operator : Our next question is with Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck, your line is open. Chuck Grom : Hi guys. Thanks a lot. Kurt, I just wanted to clarify on the guide that it sounds like July is being impacted by the drought conditions, but you still expect comps in the back half of the year to be similar to the front half, which would be sort of in that low-5% range. So, I just want to clarify there. And then just bigger picture with the garden centers, curious what the biggest learnings have been so far, both positive and negative. And I guess on the negative, what have you changed since you started that endeavor 12 months to 18 months ago? Hal Lawton : Hi good morning. This is Hal. Thanks Chuck for the question. First, I will just say on our comps, they have been very consistent in June and into July. And I think the heat and the drought is certainly impacting the business. But as I mentioned in my remarks, it\u2019s really taken more of the upside out of Q3 more so than it impacted to the downside. And that\u2019s why Kurt was kind of mentioning in his comments, kind of in our 5.2 to 5.8 guide set for the year that we expect in Q3 and Q4 to roughly run in the middle of that. And as we mentioned, that\u2019s kind of how we \u2013 what our total Q2 was as well. So, feel very good about that. And we are navigating the drought well. But \u2013 and again, it\u2019s kind of impacted the upside potentially really more in the quarter. Yes, and then on garden centers, 230 of them as we exited the quarter here. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a strong attraction of it for new customers and destination trips, more younger and female While we \u2013 and I think the thing that\u2019s different about our garden centers, while we certainly sell annuals and perennials, we are seeing real strength in what you would expect in kind of rural America, which is trees, shrubs, fruits and vegetables. And our garden centers are performing at the expectations we had, continuing to deliver strong comp lifts in the stores that we roll it out. And we have been very pleased with our vendor partnership as well, and there has been a lot of interest from our vendor partners in doing business with us as we expand into other markets. Chuck Grom : Great. Thanks Hal. Operator : Our next question is with Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. There has a lot \u2013 been a lot of discussion on this call around the state of the consumer, a lot of inflation. How did you factor overall economic pressures into your guidance for the second half of the year, especially when you consider that the guidance implies 2 years \u2013 3-year stacks are going to remain relatively consistent over the next couple of quarters? And as part of that, when would you expect traffic to turn back positive? Thank you very much. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hi Michael and good morning. I would start with we look at the history of the business and just the consistency of our performance and the stability of our performance over 30-plus years in all the varying economic cycles that we have been through. The second thing is we then look at kind of the foundation of the business and our C.U.E. business and the demand-driven, need-based orientation that, and the strong stability we have there and the share gain. And then we obviously have our own internal forecast that we have around the overall economy, and we get a lot of deep insights into our own customer trends, whether it\u2019s from Neighbor\u2019s Club data and others. And we \u2013 our view on the economy is that it will remain roughly as it is for the balance of the year. And as a consequence, our performance will stay kind of in the same range that it\u2019s been operating in as we move forward for the balance of the year. We all saw Q1\u2019s GDP was negative. We will know in a few weeks\u2019 time on Q2\u2019s GDP. We certainly know consumer sentiment and business sentiment is negative. I think it\u2019s more likely than not that the Q2 GDP is roughly in line with what Q1 was. And \u2013 but our expectation is that the second half is about the same. And if we are in a recession, it\u2019s a mild, modest recession, and we expect our business will continue to perform in the same way. On comp transactions, we are certainly watching that closely and have aspirations of turning those back positive. Two big impacts to comp transactions this year-to-date have been stimulus and then also the drought and the heat. In weeks where those two are not as applicable, we do see \u2013 we have seen positive transactions. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, the months of May and June in combination had positive comp transactions. And in markets that are less affected by the heat right now, we are seeing positive comp transactions. And we certainly anticipate as we get through those pressures the return of positive comp transactions. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is with Peter Benedict from Baird. Peter, your line is open. Peter Benedict : Good morning guys. So, thanks for taking the questions. Just, Kurt, I wanted \u2013 maybe if you can go back and expand upon the comments you made. You talked about some levers that you have that will allow you to kind of mitigate the downward pressure on EBIT margins right now and holding kind of that 10.2 for the year. Maybe expand upon those? And then how do you think about that same dynamic in the event that inflation does start to roll, and you are getting obviously 12 points of inflation right now if that reverts to par, how do those levers work? And how do you feel about the EBIT margin in that environment? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes. Peter, good morning. As we indicated in our prepared remarks and just the consistency of this business, I will start there, Peter, with just the fact that we have got good visibility on our expense structure. We have had consistency in both top line and in gross margin. So, it\u2019s really important to just start there as a needs-based, really durable business. And then from there \u2013 the other point that I would mention is that the investments in the business, when you look at SG&A and the cost, the biggest pressure is the investments of the business and the natural SG&A levers at a good low-single digit number. And we are making these purposeful investments all part of our long-term algorithm to drive a strong operating margin and return. We can do that while we are investing in the business. So, to your question about how we manage that, we certainly have the ability if needed to, to be nimble and flex on the investments because that\u2019s the area that is the greatest pressure on SG&A. And then the business just has a solid core around DNA around profit improvement, lean thinking. I mean this is something that has been built in over 10-plus years and really matured in our organization. And what we are doing today in regards to driving miles down, more inventory per truckload when you have got transportation costs. And what we are doing to just drive efficiency. Those are the different levers that we are benefiting from today, and we will continue to use that for the next few years. If there is any reason to really have to adjust from our current thesis and algorithm. So, we feel very good about our ability to drive our long-term operating margins. Peter Benedict : Great. Thanks so much. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you. So, we will take one more question, Austin, and then we will wrap it up as we are at the top of the hour. Operator : Okay. Our final question is from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Scott, your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I am just going to put them together because I know we are at the end of the call. So, just on the near-term transaction trends, I mean how much do you want to attribute that to inflation, people trying to stock up and the drought? Maybe units per transaction are up, and those are the factors driving down your transactions. And then my second question is more longer term. Our research would suggest that maybe the second year of the garden center is maybe coming in above what maybe you we are expecting just because it gets traction. People know it\u2019s there in the market. Those are two questions. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Scott and thanks for the question. And on the first part, the comp transaction decline is almost fully attributable to the stimulus lapping and the heat and the drought and kind of the compressed spring. As I mentioned earlier, in weeks and in geographies where those extraneous factors are not at play, we see strong positive comp transactions. Collectively across the months of May and June, we see positive comp transactions. We break our customers in a variety of different cohorts and segments. We see our lower-income customer group having some modest falloff, but we have mentioned that over the last month or two months. And \u2013 but as a reminder, that\u2019s a very small piece of our customer segment. Our customers own homes, they own land, they own animals, they own pets. And to some degree, that insulates them. And that\u2019s the consumer segment \u2013 I think being our business, but also if you just are reading all the newspaper headlines and watching all the various shows out there, those consumers are holding up well, and they continue to hold up well for us, too. And I think we can see that in a moment, and we also see it in the track record of this business over the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. And so our customers don\u2019t very strong, still spending and still doing well. And when you pull out the extraneous factors, we still see strong positive comp transactions and feel very good about the health of the business. And the garden centers, we feel we are very positive on our garden centers in total. Really pleased in less than 2 years of having launched the strategy to have over 15% of our chain is garden centers now. And in the stores that have had it in place for now a second garden season, they are performing very strongly. We are very pleased with how quickly our garden centers are becoming a destination in the communities, very pleased with our vendors and being able to have the great product in there and replenishing it at the right rate. We have been very pleased with our store execution and hiring garden center specialists. So, you have got a strong customer service theme in the garden centers. And then it\u2019s bridging over into the balance of the store with the transactions in there because we estimate about half of the transactions happen to garden centers are actually destination transactions that then bleed into the store or even into the side lot now. And the side lots become a much more kind of shoppable destination with the drive-through pickup. So, I am very pleased with the performance of the garden centers and just our sideline transformation. And then obviously, in combination with Project Fusion, which we haven\u2019t talked about as much today, but now over 400 stores with Project Fusion, starting to reach critical mass over 20% of our stores now, seeing the lift in the comp sales there, but also the improved customer response to the elevation in the store experience, improvements in areas like apparel and pet food, obviously, in our power tools now we have got 100 \u2013 I think it\u2019s 800 stores now \u2013 700 stores now with an updated power tools area. So, our customers \u2013 when you look at the data, you can very much see the lift in the stores that we execute Fusion in our garden centers, and it\u2019s a big driver of our market share gain that we are seeing. Scott Mushkin : Thanks Hal. Great color there. Appreciate it. Hal Lawton : Thanks Scott. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thanks Scott. And Austin, this will conclude our call today. We are around for questions and Mary and I are available today, so please feel free to reach out to us. So thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter call in October. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. On behalf of Tractor Supply, I'd like to extend our deepest sympathies and support to our communities and team members impacted by Hurricane Ian. Our store teams, our distribution centers and the store support center have done a tremendous job supporting our customers and communities during this tragic time. The team's dedication at times like this helps make us the dependable supplier our customers can count on. I'm thrilled to report that just over a week ago on October 12, we closed on the transaction to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home. We welcome the Orscheln team to Tractor Supply. We're very pleased with the 81 high-quality locations that will be converted to Tractor Supply over the next 15 months. While agreeing to the remedy with the FTC took longer than we anticipated, the outcome is in line with our expectations. We are committed to providing customers in the Midwest region with an expanded product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer. Two and a half years have passed since COVID emerged in the United States. With this quarter's results, we have now posted 10 consecutive quarters of exceptional sales growth. And from my perspective, the highlight of this impressive track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Our 3-year comp sales stack in the third quarter was approximately 46%, in line with the second quarter. And including new stores, our overall revenue growth on a 3-year basis has increased 65%. Our addressable market continues to benefit from numerous secular trends that we believe are structurally sound. Additionally, by all measures, we are gaining substantial share in our market. We've had tens of millions of new customers shop us, the past 3 years. We've retained the majority of these customers and have a substantial portion have become active members of our Neighbor's Club program. I commend the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. They've done a tremendous job, maintaining their focus on the factors that we can control and all the while expanding our competitive moat through the advancement of our Life Out Here strategy. We continue to operate in an ever-changing and challenging macro environment, which convey for a new recession, but from our view real economic growth in the near to medium term will remain flattish and tepid. On the positive side, a great sign is that we're seeing moderation in supply chain bottlenecks. However, inflation remains persistent and elevated and we anticipate this to continue well into 2023 with some moderation in the back half of 2023. At the same time, the labor market continues to remain very constrained, and we expect that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future, particularly on the front line. And as we move into next year, the labor market will be a key determiner of our country's ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions. Turning to our third quarter performance. The Tractor Supply team delivered another quarter of record results. with net sales of 8.4% growth. Comparable store sales increase of 5.7% and diluted earnings per share of $2.10. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7%, partially offset by a transaction count decline of 1.3%. As we shared entering the quarter, we anticipated that the drought would take some of the upside potential off our sales performance, and that was exactly how the quarter played out. By our estimation, less favorable weather negatively impacted our comp sales by about 150 basis points. As the drought and the heat conditions abated, we exited the quarter with strong momentum. All months of the quarter comped positive. August comp sales were stronger than July and September was the strongest month of the quarter, and we had flat comp transactions in the month of September. E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. During the quarter, we added an app features such as My Pet and upgraded our in-store mode. And we also rolled out inventory quantity visibility at the store level across all our digital properties. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the third consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of our overall comp sales performance. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food and feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. C.U.E. continues to be one of our structural advantages. And these products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips and footsteps into our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in our late spring-summer seasonal product and big ticket categories. We continue to gain share across all our categories, both in-store and online. Our Neighbor's Club membership this quarter exceeded 27 million members, and it represented nearly 75% of our sales for the quarter. Neighbor's Club continued to successfully help migrate customers up in their spending with us. And during the quarter, we reached an all-time high in high-value customers. In August, we rebranded Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply. In August, we also rolled out the Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. This expansion will deepen relationships with our existing customers and helped attract new pet customers to both banners. And while it's early, we are very pleased with our customers' response to these initiatives, with our Neighbor's Club membership already representing over 35% of sales at Petsense. For the third consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. We ended the quarter with our inventory in great shape. As we said many times, if anything, we'd like to have more inventory. And we're now working hard to grow inventory in targeted categories to improve our in-stock position and serve as that dependable supplier for our customers. We continue to stay true to our EDLP routes, and our promotional activity in the third quarter was below the prior year's third quarter. We've made significant progress in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have over 500 stores that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center transformation is now active in over 260 locations. We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store level investments. Given our performance through the third quarter, our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our sales and earning guidance for 2022. Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Stepping back, Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our resilient need-based business model has a proven history of growing through vary economic conditions. Our customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We believe that the structural macro trends that have been benefiting us are long term and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial advantages and continue to gain share. The investment in our Life Out Here strategy is reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Simply said, Tractor Supply has never been stronger. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient. This is a business that was built for all economic environments with stability in both revenue and earnings over multiple decades. Comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all 3 quarters year-to-date. All regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comps. The geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. The South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic were our best-performing regions. As expected, we did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the severe heat and drought in particular, in the Far West and Texahoma regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. For background, July was the second hottest in 30-plus years. And during August, about 40% of the U.S. was under extreme drought conditions. As Hal shared, we believe that the less than ideal weather weighed on our transactions as well as our big ticket sales. Much like the second quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 7% benefited from inflation, partially offset by declines in big ticket sales and average units per transaction. Big ticket sales performance, while positive on a 2-year stack was impacted by the severe drought and cycling 2 hurricanes in the prior year. We saw the largest impact in categories such as generators, 0 turns and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the third quarter, our gross margin declined by 32 basis points to 35.6% of sales. Our price management actions and our other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from cost inflation and higher transportation costs. With the continued robust growth in our C.U.E. categories, we saw pressure on our gross margin as C.U.E. runs below chain average on gross margin rate. In regard to inflation, while moderating, we continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories, as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting both us and our vendor partners. We have remained agile and nimble to manage all the complexity of today's environment, effectively managing cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club. SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 9% to the prior year's third quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 16 basis points year-over-year to 26.3%. This increase was in line with our expectations, primarily attributable to our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and hourly wage and benefit investments in both our stores and our distribution centers. These items were partially offset by a moderation of COVID-19 response costs, more normalized incentive compensation and leverage in our occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.10, an increase of 7.7% from the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing a 19.2% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Looking at our inventory growth on a 3-year stack, it represents a 30% increase in average inventory per store compared to Q3 2019, meaningfully below our sales increase over the same period of time. There continue to be select product categories where we are still pursuing inventory, especially in C.U.E. Stepping back, we believe our inventory position is in good shape. Our strong balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply, allowing us to invest in the business for growth and return cash to shareholders. To further our financial flexibility, we just entered into a new 5-year credit agreement on September 30 that increases our senior credit facility from $700 million to $1.2 billion. We also added 2 new banks to our banking group, including a minority-owned bank. Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. In addition, we are incorporating the impact of our recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. We are forecasting fiscal 2022 net sales of $14.06 billion to $14.12 billion including about $75 million in sales from Orscheln. This is the first time in the history of our company that annual sales are forecast to be above $14 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5.4% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.5% in line with our prior guidance, but with modest pressure from the acquisition as the sales and earnings benefit from Orscheln Farm and Home are offset by incremental transaction expenses and early integration costs. We anticipate the impact of Orscheln to be relatively neutral to operating income, while we expect a modestly negative impact on net income due to the interest expense associated with funding the acquisition. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $9.55 to $9.63. This compares to our previous earnings range of $9.48 to $9.60 per diluted share. We entered October with momentum. With this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 5% to 7%. We now expect to open approximately 60 to 70 new Tractor Supply stores, which is modestly below our outlook as we entered the year. We continue to be on track for 10 Petsense store openings in 2022. Given the conditions of the real estate and construction industries, the cadence of store openings for Tractor Supply has shifted a number of the openings into the fourth quarter. I give the cross-functional teams a lot of credit for completing over 250 projects this year as they lay the foundation for 2023 and beyond. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2022, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 million to $800 million. As is customary, we will provide our full guidance for 2023 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We are early in our planning cycle for the next year. I thought it'd be helpful to set the stage and share some preliminary insights and color into our thought process, given that there are a few moving parts between 2022 and 2023. Our business model has stood the test of time and has proven to be resilient. We have significant confidence with 2023 on the horizon. We are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. Further, we have consistent structural trends that will continue to benefit us. We continue to invest in our Life Out Here value strategy to capture this growth. Now the discrete items that impact our earnings in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit this year, and the accretion from Orscheln acquisition. As I've shared previously, we forecast that the 53rd week will add approximately 1.5% growth in net sales and about $0.15 to the EPS this year. As you saw our press release earlier this month, we expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10. When adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, we plan for 2023's performance to be consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11% with our bias at this point in planning towards the midpoint of our range. Despite what might play out with the economy, this needs-based demand-driven characteristics of our product offering support our ability to deliver on our long-term outlook. We are making great progress towards our long-term financial goals, and we look forward to sharing with you our 2023 plans in more detail at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Now to wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we have made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strengths and further expand our lead for years to come.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply is a business with momentum. As our customers prepare for cooler temperatures and the calendar shift to the fall and winter season, our stores are ready for the change. From key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value. In our C.U.E. categories, we have the right selection and are in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles. This year, we expanded our Halloween and Harvest Decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love of decorating their homes with seasonal indoor and outdoor decor. With more than 260 Garden Centers, we're showcasing the fall harvest season with everything from pumpkins to mums, and will be ready for the transition to the Christmas holiday season with an expanded offering of outdoor decorations. Despite the economic outlook, we are optimistic about holiday-related sales. From the calendar perspective, it's a good setup with 30 days this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, with Christmas falling on a Sunday. We have a strong day after Thanksgiving game plan and compelling offers planned throughout the season. Given the increasing financial constraints facing American consumers, we're excited in the coming weeks to introduce the Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card will help our consumers earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. With the Tractor Supply Visa Card, customers receive access to all the perks from the private label TSC personal credit card that they have such as 5% rewards on Tractor Supply purchases or special financing on purchases at $199 and up, but they also will receive 3% in rewards on gas station, grocery and vet purchases and 1% in rewards on all other purchases. And all consumer card members with Tractor Supply received Neighbor's Club Preferred Plus benefits. This is exciting progress on our journey to driving sales, building loyalty and adding more value to our Neighbor's Club membership and reducing tender expense through our credit offerings. 2022 is shaping up to be another great year for Tractor Supply. With one quarter to go, we are on track to achieve several monumental milestones in the growth of our company, including annual revenues in excess of $14 billion, a store base of over 2,100 Tractor Supply locations and a highly engaged workforce of 50,000-plus team members. That said, we are not resting on our laurels. We have robust plans in place for 2023 to continue on our life out here strategic journey. As we enter the new year, the transformation of our business has significant momentum. Investments such as Neighbor's Club, our FAST program and our mobile app are at scale on providing dividends. Our store investments are reaching scale, and we have compelling new growth vectors such as the integration of Orscheln and many other opportunities on the list. With a healthy total addressable market of $180 billion, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to gain market share while fulfilling our purpose as a company. As we enter one of the busiest peers in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of our 50,000-plus Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : So you mentioned that you would have liked to have had more inventory, do you think that you left any sales on the table as a result of being out of stock? Hal Lawton : Liz, thanks for joining the call. I think we're doing an excellent job on navigating inventory and managing it. We don't feel like we're leaving any sales on the table because of it. But I think we are, at times, incurring some higher cost to run the inventory through our supply chain than we might otherwise. And also just on the labor side, having to work the back room a little bit more frequently than normal. The team has done an excellent job on it. But if you look at kind of weeks of supply and kind of pallet low quantities, we would be looking to continue to add inventory in our core C.U.E. businesses. As we talked about, this is the third consecutive quarter where our C.U.E. business has performed at 3x the chain average, dry dog food running well above 20% comps and other feed categories running very strong as well. And so it's just all about keeping up with the customer and then building our supply chain for the future to make sure that we can continue to move these billions and billions of pounds of food and feed that we do every year and maintain as lower cost as possible. We're very excited about our Navarre, Ohio, D.C. opening up early next year that will give us a little more streamlined supply chain and capacity to continue to serve our customers in Life Out Here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Appreciate some of the thoughts you guys gave here, at least initially around next year. Hal, I think we can appreciate how strong your business is. A lot of uncertainties on the macro front. You alluded to that early in your comments. How do you think about -- and maybe for Kurt as well here, just the company's ability to still land in that earnings algo in the event we get a tougher economic environment maybe than what your base case is, where are the levers? How do you think about managing the business in that environment? That's my question. Hal Lawton : Yes. Thanks for joining the call today. Good to talk with you. We feel very confident in our ability to deliver 2023 and continue to deliver on our long-term targets. If you look at the consistency of our business this year with a 5.1, 5.5 ,5.7 comp, a strong outlook for Q4, very consistent in an economy this year that you would argue really is stagflation kind of flattish, real growth, high single-digit inflation.  And as we look towards next year, our expectation, it will be much of the same. What I would say -- and consequently, our business will continue to be very resilient and stable. And the other thing I would add is, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, I mean many of our investments are just now starting to reach significant scale, and we expect that they will pay substantive dividends next year. We're now at over 500 stores and our Fusion layout seeing very strong results there. Many of those will be comping for the first time next year. Same thing on Garden Centers, 260, many of those came online just at the beginning of this year. We expect they will, just like we saw in the first year class, they will have a new store kind of maturity curve like sales growth. And so we expect really strong results out of those Garden Centers as we head into next year. We've gotten much better at rolling out our remodel programs, and we've got a number of Garden Centers queued up for implementation and execution before we get to spring of next year. So we feel like the economy is stable. We -- our outlook on the economy is not much different than what it is right now. We expect our business to continue to be very resilient and allow us to deliver our long-term targets. And as I said, our Life Out Here strategic initiatives are really reaching scale now and the benefits that we've talked about are starting to kind of really add up across our store base. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : So I just wanted to -- you guys continue to kind of expand out your TAM and maybe I've missed it over time, but we've been coming across a lot of vet clinics in your stores. And I was just wondering what -- is that a big initiative, again, maybe I've missed it? And when do you think that can add kind of as we go forward? Hal Lawton : Yes. Scott, it's good to talk to you today, and thanks for joining the call. The vet clinics are a core part of our fusion kind of menu. And as we go in to execute a Fusion store, we look at the existing mobile clinic activity. And if it warrants -- given the frequency of business and the customer count, if it warrants a stand-alone vet clinic, we are putting those in. And they've been very successful and are just really another value-added feature to support our pet business. As we talked about, we are gaining substantial share in pet.  For the last handful of quarters, we've run 10 to 15 points above the market growth rate in pet. And even as you're hearing others talk about the pet business starting to moderate, we aren't seeing that at all in our business, and it's because we're gaining substantial share. That share gain starts with the core basics of great customer service, in-stock, the right price, strong private label brands, but then it's certainly augmented with our other offerings, whether it's pet wash, whether it's the vet clinics and our Rx solutions, which are available online. And the pet business is a strong source of growth for us, and we expect it will continue to be as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Steven Forbes : I wanted to focus on member trends. So Hal, curious if you can discuss any incremental learnings around retention or repeat behavior, specifically as it pertains to the 2020 member cohort as they approach their second anniversary. And then maybe just quickly comment on whether you view the 2021 or 2022 cohorts any differently? Hal Lawton : Yes. Thanks for the call and the question. We continue to be very pleased with our Neighbor's Club program. And more broadly, our customer relationship management that we've had over the last 3 years that the Neighbor's Club rollout that we did nearly 2 years ago now -- 1.5 years ago now has exceeded our expectations. We've had tens of millions of new customers shoppers over the last 3 years and the majority of those customers continue to shop at Tractor Supply. And a majority of those that have continued to shop at Tractor Supply have also joined our Neighbor's Club program and been a big driver of our membership growth. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had the highest level of high-value customers this quarter that we've ever had. And a lot of those are new customers that have grown with us over the last 2 and 3 years. And as we gain new customers also in '21 and '22, they are following that kind of continued kind of above historical average performance, both in their kind of average purchase sizes in a year, their frequency of purchase with us and also the expanding number of categories that they're shopping with us also. I think this has been a big area of success for us and it's really what's been able to create that foundation for us to have held the 65% growth in sales we've had over the last 3 quarters. I mean last 3 years. And you think about a lot of other businesses that had similar new customer growth that have given back much of that growth. And that's not been the case with us. I mean we firmly believe that the secular trends that have benefited us had are structurally sound, that the share gains we've gained are structurally sound and a lot of it has to do with our very sophisticated CRM capabilities that are far and away kind of best-in-class overall in retail and certainly in our market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan Chase. Chris Horvers : So can you talk a little bit more about the shape of the quarter? With September 7 comp, and as we look forward, should the inflation lift moderate along the lines of the comparisons, but then traffic turned slightly positive? Or does the persistence of wage inflation lead to acceleration in the inflation stacks over the next 3 or 4 quarters as you can see it today. Hal Lawton : Yes. Good morning, Chris, and how are you? We had -- we exited -- as we mentioned, September was our strongest month of the quarter. Outperformed relative to the overall average, obviously, and had flat comp transactions. It has -- we have had that momentum continue and even a little bit more coming into the fourth quarter here. It's certainly been cooler weather for the first month of the quarter here. And that's driven nice heating sales and insulated outerwear sales and heating fuel sales.  As you know, some big businesses for us in the fourth quarter are propane and wood pellets. And just given the high energy costs that are out there, the cooler weather that's already begun, the angst that our consumers have around inflation, some of the concerns around how European energy prices might be back in the United States. We are very optimistic about how those categories will play out in the fourth quarter. And also optimistic around how the flat comp transactions in September will play out for the fourth quarter as well for us. And we feel like if you look back over the first 9 months of the year, there are numerous months where we had flat or positive comp transactions. And the ones where we didn't, you really can identify them through either stimulus in March and April of last year or whether it was the drought and heat-related activities or the delayed spring through Q1 and Q2. But if you look at January, February, et cetera and then you look at how we exited in Q3 and a couple of slices of month in Q2 where we had flat deposit and comp transactions, we feel very good that those sorts of trends will extrapolate into Q4. As it relates to inflation, we do anticipate that there will be some moderation towards the back half of next year. But if you look at our 2-year stacks on inflation and carry that into the first half of next year, we do anticipate that inflation will remain at elevated rates through at least the first half of next year. And I think that's reasonably consistent with the overall kind of macro U.S. outlook as well. But we do feel really good about our comp transactions now as we head into the fourth quarter and the momentum that we have going into the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : So Hal, previously, I think you touched a little bit on this earlier, maybe on Peter's question. And historically, you guys provided some expectations regarding the impact of your fusion remodels and side lot transformations. And now with some, let's call it, significant experience under your belt, I was hoping you could potentially update us on any other stats that you're kind of seeing out of these initiatives? Maybe any other important learnings that you've been able to conclude. Hal Lawton : Scott, and thanks for joining the call, and thanks for the question. We continue to be very pleased with our store remodel program. And on the sales side, they continue to perform at the level of results that we articulated at the beginning of this year. So that's for a combo store that has both Fusion and side lot inclusive of a garden center. They're performing in the high single-digit lifts year-over-year kind of pre post net of control. . And when you look at a store where we've only done Fusion, they're performing in that mid-single-digit lift. And as we all know, it hasn't been in retail for decades now. When you first start a store remodel program, because you're handholding it, you're going to get a nice lift. But then as you start to scale. A lot of times, those lifts will start to diminish and moderate a bit, that has not been the case with us. we're now at 500 Fusion stores and over 260 garden centers, and we continue to see that same type of lift even as we reach scale, real tribute to our team on the execution, operations and then ensuring that we've got the right programs as we roll those out. Other learnings, our customers are taking note of these remodels. We're seeing on our customer satisfaction surveys, we're seeing overall increases after the remodel. We're seeing kind of questions like the condition of the store, the appearance of the store, many of our customers qualitative will ask if we've updated the store and they notice it. And the same thing on the garden centers. We're seeing many new customers shop our business once we roll out a garden center, much higher female penetration, much higher millennial penetration. And we're seeing it be a driver of footsteps into our store to kind of starting the next kind of version of C.U.E. category in our business and that being live goods. I think the big learning force has been on cost. We continue to challenge ourselves on our rollout timing and our costs. We continue to reduce the length of time required to roll one of these out that minimizes the disruption cannibalization, and we're also continuing to bring down the cost through optimization of our fixtures, optimization of our construction plans and particularly on the garden center, our designs there. So if anything, we feel like the performance is better than it was 9 months ago, kind of equivalent, if not better, sales lift and customer reaction. And we continue to find ways to bring costs down on the program. So we're very pleased with the remodels and excited to continue to roll it out to the next set of stores next year and continue to bring into our whole store base. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to ask about strategic growth initiatives with regards to either CapEx and SG&A as it flows through the P&L. Can you give us a sense, is the business at the top of a spending cycle now with a lot of the changes that have brought in over the last few years? Or do investments in SG&A, do they step up? Do they moderate? Or do they decelerate from here? Kurt Barton : Simeon, this is Kurt. Good morning to you and everybody on the call. In regards to our investment cycle, 2022, 2023 has really been viewed as, to your point, a peak in that investment cycle. We will be opening up Navarre, Ohio, as Hal mentioned earlier. We will be building the Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center in 2023, and we'll continue our path on this cadence for the existing store remodels under the Fusion program. So 2023 is really a bit of that peak. But it has been planned that way with the growth and depreciation that we've seen this year, roughly mid- to high 20%. We expect to see in 2023, about a similar year-over-year growth rate moderating net growth rate over time. So our SG&A is -- we've got great visibility to it. We feel confident to the point that Hal mentioned on cost. And the pressures from the investments, we also see the offsets to that in SG&A that we've got in regards to leveraging on these -- the comp sales. I am thrilled about the maturity and the development of the culture and the organization's view on profit improvement. We've got a lot of great things in the works right now, not only on the supply chain side and how we can continue to leverage the investments there to drive improvements in gross margin, but what we can do through procurement and how this organization is focused on driving efficiencies and productivities in the stores and in our distribution centers. So to wrap that up, yes, there continues to be pressure from investments in the business very much as we expected. But we've got also in the trend rate the expectations of the offsets to it, which is how we see SG&A generally playing flattish as a percentage of sales going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Oliver Wintermantel : I had a question regarding trade down if you've seen any of that within categories and if you expect promotions to step up in the fourth quarter? Seth Estep : Hey, Oliver. This is Seth. Thanks for joining the call. When we look at trends in the category today, we're not seeing any meaningful trade down at this time. In fact, if you look at our kind of portfolio strategy, we've got a very balanced portfolio across kind of opening price point all the way up to our premium segments within our category strategies. And we continue to see strength across all 3 categories.  One of the things that's very encouraging though as well is north of our 20% store-owned exclusive brands that we have. We're really starting to see our customer base really dive into our exclusive brands. And our exclusive brand penetration in Q3 was up 130 basis points over the prior year as they're really navigating to our premium value-oriented segments or our exclusive brand and really driving loyalty. And that's something you'll see us continue to lean in on the balance of this year. But even more importantly, as we look into 2023 is how we continue to go after that loyalty factor relative to our portfolio of strategy and driving both innovation across all 3 product tiers and then really leaning into exclusive brands. On promotional cadence and activity, you'll see us very similar to last year. I mean we've got over 27 million members in our Neighbor's Club today. We're really leaning into that capability. We're really hitting our stride, diving into that data set, being very smart with our promotional activity, but also make sure that we're pulsing the market relative to Black Friday and some other things with just some great offers that we partner with some of our key suppliers on. So you see some messaging there as well, but our promotional activity should be consistent with what you've seen recently over the course of the last couple of years as we've really been focused on our EDLP approach and making sure we're gaining market share in our essential businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Just now that the transaction is closed, I wondered if you could talk any more about Orscheln and how you plan to integrate that and what you see in terms of the future for those 81 stores you are now taking on? Hal Lawton : Kate, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. And thanks for your question on Orscheln. To start out, just reiterating my prepared remarks that we're thrilled to have Orscheln join Tractor Supply. While the transaction took longer than we anticipated, the outcome was very much in line with our original expectations on the remedy that would be necessary. We are already well underway to welcoming them into the company and starting to map out our plans for converting those stores to the Tractor Supply brand. We will be basically executing the Fusion and Garden Center remodel programs in those stores. And obviously, there'll be a little extra involved with them in terms of new signage for our nameplates and some updating of fixtures and painting of the walls and such like that. But we will -- our plan is to have all that accomplished by the end of next year. At the same time, we're excited to learn from Orscheln on a number of categories where they play differently than we do in terms of distortions. And on the same side, we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to take some of our best practices to them -- to their stores; one, in terms of -- and then driving dollars per square foot up closer to where we are because they're at about kind of 50-ish percent of where we are in dollars per square foot and because they are lesser dollars per square foot, the op margin percent on a per store basis is lower as well. So we're optimistic that we can raise that over time as well. And so there's some sales synergies over time, there'll be some op margin synergies over time. And then additionally, we'll be bringing our brand awareness to that business well over 80% unaided and aided together and things like our Neighbor's Club program, our digital capabilities. So we're really excited to have them join us. It gives us a great additional footprint in the Midwest. We're excited about transitioning those stores to the Tractor Supply brand and then bringing kind of the whole of Tractor Supply to those stores and ultimately and most importantly, to our customers there in that area of the country. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Chuck Grom : Most of my questions have been asked, but I was curious on supply chain, how you talked about some relief on that front. I guess I'm curious, the lag, and how long we should anticipate it? To start to see some freight relief ocean container cost start to show up in the P&L? Kurt Barton : Chuck, this is Kurt. On transportation costs, as Hal indicated, we are seeing both domestic and to an extent, imports those costs beginning to moderate as the demand on the overall global supply is starting to ease. So we are taking advantage of that. To your question about the timing of it. Two factors. One, it's got to work its way through the pipeline. So we could start to see cost in early to mid-2023, reflecting newer improved transportation costs. And that's from 2 factors, not only selling through the cost of goods that have the peak cost in them currently today. We work off of and advantage off of longer-term contracts. And so what the team is doing and has been doing as the demand on supply -- on the supply chain and transportation eases our negotiations on those costs. So as we begin to see overall contract prices come down, those will start to go through the pipeline. And in transportation, in the long term, 2023 and beyond, we do see that as one of the areas of efficiency, one of the areas that does help us and as part of our algorithm in gross margin expansion over time as we come off some of these peak transportation costs. But do see about a 6- to 9-month process not only to get inventory through the supply chain, but to be able to be working off of new and lower contracted costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Atul Maheswari :  This is Atul Maheswari for Michael Lasser. I have a follow-up question for you on inflation. You mentioned that inflation is likely to moderate in the back half of next year. But what are the chances that there could be deflation, especially given there are signs that some costs are coming in. And if there is deflation, how would you expect your P&L to react to such backdrop? Because back in 2016 and '17, you're a few quarters of sluggish comp. Then because of some deflation, but how is the business today that will help you navigate the statuary backlog better than what you'd back at? Hal Lawton : Yes, thanks for the question. We don't foresee a scenario of deflation in any near-term time horizon. '23 or into '24. If you look at where our retailers are now and just flow those through into the first half of the year, we're going to be at mid- to high single-digit inflation. And then fully expect that, that will moderate into the back half, both as we start to navigate reducing COGS increases but also, hopefully, as the economy PPI and CPI and other kind of inflationary indexes start to moderate as well. But I don't foresee at all a scenario of deflation in the near -- in any time horizon over the next few years. What I would say on some of those commodity-based products, we're well past just kind of core supply demand out there and the market is moving like they had 4, 5, 6 years ago in a normal environment. We're now in a market where even they've got higher input cost, whether it's fertilizer, and et cetera, that just has not come down. And even if it comes down, it's only coming down in a moderate way. They've got higher labor cost 10, 15, 20 points above a couple of years ago, and there's significant capacity constraints. I mean if you look at pet food, there are significant capacity constraints in the pet food market right now. So that's going to limit cost. That's going to limit any cost decreases that come. It's just the dynamics of the way the supply demand is shaping up right now. And then when you factor in non-U.S. markets and all the risk there, whether it's down in South America or certainly in middle -- in Eastern Europe with Ukraine and Russia and the difficulties in the war there, I just don't foresee a market at all where commodities are moderating to the point where they're driving substantive deflation in our business. That's just -- I don't see that in the cards at all. Operator : Our final question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : The question I have. Clearly, I mean clearly, Tractor Supplies are performing remarkably well here. And this is despite some macro headwinds out there. I mean the question I have as we look into '23 or whenever, if macro conditions were to worsen and start to impact somewhat the trends at Tractor, are there levers or what were the levers that you -- either you could or you would pull either from a cost standpoint or maybe a merchandising perspective to better tailor your business to that type of environment? Hal Lawton : Yes. Brian, and thanks for the question, and thanks for the remarks on our quarter. We're very optimistic around Q3 -- I mean around 2023. As I mentioned earlier, on the revenue side, many of our initiatives are just starting to really reach kind of scale that you can kind of \u201csee from space.\u201d You think about 500 Fusion stores now, 260 Garden Centers, the continued strong lift we're seeing with those as we round into next year, we anticipate that those will continue to help fuel our business, and if there is any sort of further degradation of the economy that they can help fill in some of those cracks. I also anticipate that our core competitors, if the economy weakens further, will face increasing financial difficulties, and that will only be further opportunity for us to go gain share. So we feel very good on the top side around 2023 in our ability to gain share and grow and do that within the context of our long-term guidance. And then on the cost side, while there's a bunch that goes in and goes out, while we performed well in the last 2 years and half off to the team for managing our operating margins, there's been a lot of inefficiencies in our cost base the last couple of years, higher container cost, higher freight costs, having to open up pop-up distribution centers freight arriving -- and not on the day and time that we anticipated in the back of the stores or having inefficient labor in our stores to do tasking. As we move into 2023, we fully anticipate that our business will be the most streamlined from a supply chain perspective, all the way from the manufacturer into the stores and on our shelves that it's been in 3 years. And so we're optimistic on that from a cost perspective, being able to help drive our overall profitability and our margins. And again, just very confident as we turn into 2023 near 1 quarter to go, but a lot of momentum as we enter Q4 here now, and we expect that, that will be the case as we transition into 2023. Operator : Thank you for your questions. This concludes our QA session for today's call. I will now pass back to Mary Winn Pilkington for closing remarks. Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Flora, and thank you for everybody for joining our call. Marianne and I will be around today if you have any remaining questions, please feel free to reach out. And the team looks forward to speaking to you at Q4 in January. So thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Hal Lawton : Thanks, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of a record year for Tractor Supply. Year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, and I'm pleased to share the results from the team in 2022. We had sales growth of 11.6% and diluted earnings per share growth of almost 13% and this is on top of a record performance in 2021. We had solid market share gains across all our product categories, and these gains continue to contribute materially to our sales growth. At Tractor Supply, it all starts with the team. And my sincere thanks and appreciation goes out to the more than 50,000 team members of Tractor Supply who work diligently every day to live our mission and values. Regardless of the operating challenges throughout the year and really over the last three years since we entered the pandemic, the team has delivered impressive results while also making significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. I commend and thank the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. Our team plus our business model are the reasons why we have a record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. With this year's results, we've now posted three consecutive years of exceptional sales growth. The highlight of this phenomenal track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Including new stores in the 53rd week, our revenue on a three-year basis has increased about 70%, with a three-year comp stack of 46.5%. Over the same period of time, we've invested nearly $1.7 billion in our stores, distribution centers, technology and other strategic initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. We also have significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint, and delivering on the increased volume of our consumable, usable and edible products. We've remained focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms, all with the underlying goal to be the dependable supplier that our customers count on. As a company, we hit several significant billion dollar milestones in 2022. We grew our sales to a record $14.2 billion, increased net income to over $1 billion, achieved $1 billion in private label credit card sales and returned more than $1 billion in capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year. This culminated with diluted earnings per share of $9.71. Now turning to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 performance. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Albeit, comp sales performance was stronger than forecast as the late December winter storm provided a comp sales lift of approximately two percentage points. Excluding the impact of the winter storm, importantly, our underlying results were in line with the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter and the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales growth was 8.6%, and it was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.3% and transaction count increase of plus 2.3%. And importantly, even without the winter storm benefit, our comp transactions would have been positive for the quarter. All months of the quarter comped positive. October, December were our strongest comp sales months. Both two and three-year comp stacks were relatively consistent across the quarter. On e-commerce, it achieved mid single-digit positive sales growth, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. As of year-end, the Tractor Supply app has had over 4.4 million downloads since it was launched mid-2020. For the seventh consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the fourth consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of overall comp sales growth. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food as well as feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. As we've talked about many times, C.U.E. is one of our structural advantages and the products represent the strength of our core business and they're what drive trips to our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in big ticket categories. And we continue to gain share across our categories, both online and in-store. Shifting now to Neighbor's Club. Our Neighbor's Club membership exceeded 28 million members and represented nearly 75% of our sales for the year. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the quarter, we reached a new record in the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping with us more frequently and spending more money per transaction. On Petsense, the rebranding of Petsense, the Petsense by Tractor Supply along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply is really resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers in our enterprise and help attract new pet customers to both brands. Our customers\u2019 response to these initiatives is very encouraging, with Neighbor\u2019s Club membership already representing nearly 50% of sales at Petsense. During the quarter, we launched Tractor Supply, Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card allows our customers to earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. This marks exciting progress on our journey to drive sales, build loyalty and reduce tender expense through our credit offerings. And as I mentioned earlier, this past year, we crossed over $1 billion in private label credit card sales. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction score hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. Our team continued to make advancements in our supply chain through the expansion of our mixing centers to a total now of 15 as well as the grand opening of our ninth distribution center just last week. During the quarter, we also broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas to support for the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. In 2022, we moved more than 8 billion pounds of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the world\u2019s largest seller of bag feed and food for livestock and companion animals. Our scale and reach provide us with the cost to serve that is lower than our competition. We continue to advance on our commitment to be stewards of Life Out Here. We\u2019re making progress on our absolute carbon reduction goals to further reduce emissions from our operations by 20% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030 from our 2020 baseline. We are committed to achieving net 0 emissions across all operations by 2040. Additionally, in 2022 of April, we announced an ambitious three-year water conservation goal to conserve 25 million gallons of water by 2025. These commitments to the climate and society reinforce our vision that a healthy environment, properly managed resources and vibrant communities are keys to a secure and prosperous future for Life Out Here. As a result, our efforts to enhance our sustainable business practices have been recognized by various third parties. We now have nearly 30% of our store base that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center build out is now active in over 300 locations. With nearly 1,800 team members, our field activity support team has made powerful contributions to our in-stock performance and execution of our sales-driving initiatives. We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store-level investments. This was a year that we made significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. And building on our performance for 2022, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term guidance. And Kurt will share more details on our outlook as well as more details on our performance in 2022 in just a moment. Now shifting a bit to 2023. As we planned for the year, we anticipate continuing to operate in an ever challenging and changing macro environment. Our operating assumption is that the economy in the near to medium-term will remain resilient with flat to modestly positive real growth. Wages are increasing and consumers continue to tap pent-up savings to support spending. We expect consumers will continue to be judicious in their spend, but resilient, while prioritizing needs over discretionary. We believe inflation has peaked, but will remain sticky as we move through the year. It is our view that an orderly loosening of the labor market will be a key determiner of the country\u2019s ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions in the second half and 2024. The effects of secondary markets on our consumer spending in areas such as housing, agriculture and oil markets are expected to be collectively neutral and individually modest. Whatever economic environment plays out this year or any year for that matter, we\u2019re confident that our business will remain resilient and build on our strong track record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We\u2019re a need-based business that is tailored to the Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. We\u2019re celebrating our 85th anniversary this year. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me build on how sentiment for 2022. As we start out the year, we anticipated that our business would continue to exhibit consistent performance as we have a proven business model that has stood the test of time. The team delivered against our goals and exceeded our expectations. The impact of the 53rd week on our performance is detailed in our press release. To recap, the 53rd week added about $225 million to our net sales in the fourth quarter representing 6.8 points of our net sales growth. On a full year basis, it represented 1.8 points of the 11.6% growth year-over-year. Diluted EPS benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, all regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comp. All months were comp positive. As for the cadence of the quarter, our comp store sales were performing at the high end of our outlook as we move into mid-December. Then as Winter Storm Elliott moved across the country, our sales accelerated given the storm\u2019s impact on our customers\u2019 needs for heat, insulated outerwear, livestock feed and forage and some load up of other C.U.E. products. As Hal shared, we estimate the storm provided about 2 percentage point benefit to our comp sales. Much like any emergency response events such as hurricanes, the profitability of these sales from winter storm events of this magnitude is lower due to the mix of products and higher incremental operating costs. Our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here was exhibited during this historic storm. Looking back, when excluding the December winter storm comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all four quarters of the year. Similar to trends through the year, retail price inflation contributed about 11 points to our comparable store sales in Q4 as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 6.3% benefited from inflation, partially offset by a shift in sales mix to needs-based consumables versus the larger ticket items. Demand for C.U.E. categories was nearly 3 times the chain average, while big ticket sales performance was down mid-single digits. We did see strong performance in winter needs-based items such as heaters, snow throwers and log splitters. The performance in these big ticket categories somewhat offset the declines we saw in more discretionary categories like utility and recreational vehicles and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our gross margin improved by 28 basis points to an even 34% of sales. Our price management actions and other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from year-over-year product cost inflation, higher transportation costs and product mix due to the strength of C.U.E. categories. During the quarter, we experienced a significant moderation in the rate of price increases from our vendors, but by no means are we seeing deflation. Our promotional activity was in line with the prior year and we are seeing moderation in transportation costs that we expect to flow through in 2023. Of note, it\u2019s our belief that transportation costs most likely peaked in the fourth quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 25.1%. As we indicated in Q3, this increase was primarily attributable to three factors : one, the impact of transaction expenses and early integration costs associated with our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home; two, our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and three, our investments in team member compensation and benefits. These items were partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.43, an increase of 25.9% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. Overall, we continue to believe that our inventory position is in good shape. Today, we believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our structural tailwinds such as rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership continue to benefit us. Our Life Out Here strategic investments have made us stronger. Adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term targets as we continue to see the power of compounding from our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent capital return to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2023, we are forecasting net sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion, including at least $300 million in sales from Orscheln. Our outlook marks another milestone in our performance as annual sales are forecasted to be above $15 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5%. We expect gross margin expansion of about 20 to 40 basis points from supply chain benefits and a moderation in both product cost increases and the mix impact of C.U.E. We anticipate SG&A will deleverage modestly due to a few factors. Depreciation amortization is anticipated increase by 17% to 20% relating to our strategic growth initiatives. Also, we opened our ninth distribution center just this month. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. We expect the incremental cost to pressure SG&A by approximately 15 to 20 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. And lastly, the integration of Orscheln Farm and Home is expected to impact SG&A by approximately 5 basis points. These factors are partially offset by the normalization of incentive compensation and leverage occupancy and other operating costs from the increase in comparable store sales. And for the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $55 million as we have increased borrowings to fund our capital allocation. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of 2 times or below. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23%. We continue to expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10 in 2023. All in, diluted EPS is forecast in the range of $10.30 to $10.60. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the half of the year. As you model 2023, I want to point out a few things that will impact comparability. And I\u2019d like to give a little color on the flow across quarters. From a sales perspective, we are planning for all four quarters to have comp sales performance generally within our guidance range. We anticipate retail price inflation to benefit comp sales by 3 to 5 points with the benefit being higher in the first half than the second half as inflation pressures begin to moderate. We are planning for positive comp transactions in 2023. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be fairly balanced between first half and second half. There are a couple of discrete items that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. The first quarter will likely be our toughest comparison from an operating margin rate perspective. Start-up costs for the new distribution center will pressure the first quarter, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized until the second quarter. Additionally, transportation costs are expected to continue to be higher year-over-year in Q1 and then begin to moderate through the remainder of the year with the second half expected to see favorable comparisons. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation in October when we cycle the acquisition date. Also keep in mind, the discrete items that impact our earnings comparability in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit, partially offset by the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition. And when adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the 2023 accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, our outlook for 2023 is consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11%. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $700 million to $775 million, with about 80% for growth initiatives. We expect to open approximately 70 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to be on track for 10 to 15 Petsense store openings in 2023. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2023, we anticipate share purchases in a range of $575 million to $675 million, which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Our business model has to the test of time and is proven to be resilient. While we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of economic growth on consumer demand, we believe that we are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. To wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we\u2019ve made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strength and further expand our lead for years to come. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thank you, Kurt. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, Tractor Supply is a business that continues to have significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. Our position in our customer spending is for stable, needs based and demand driven product categories. We are in defensive product categories for the lifestyle our customers live. At the same time, we are playing offense to capture organic growth opportunities. We have idiosyncratic growth drivers that are separating us from the competition. As a company, three words that really summarize Tractor Supply\u2019s performance are : one consistent, two, reliable, and three, sustainable. And I\u2019d like to walk through these three words and share what I see as structural tailwinds across them to support our future performance. Let\u2019s start first with consistent performance. We have a track record of delivering positive sales growth for over 30 consecutive years. 30 of the last 31 years have had positive comp sales. We\u2019ve had consistent traffic growth across economic cycles and we\u2019re planning for positive traffic growth in 2023. Our marketplace has shown consistent growth for decades and decades. Our total addressable market of $180 billion continues to benefit from numerous trends that we believe are structurally found. Additionally by all accounts, we are gaining substantial share in our market. For instance, our queue product categories are driven by livestock feed for cattle, equine and poultry and companion animal food. In addition to categories like heating fuel, wildlife feed, pest control and lubricants, we\u2019re entering new product categories through our Garden Center transformations then open up new queue categories that provide a halo to the store as new and existing customers shop our expanded lawn and garden categories. Our stores with a Fusion layout and Garden Center transformations are gaining more customers than the balance of the chain. In just over two years since we started our Life Out Here strategy, we have gained significant scale in our Fusion remodels and the transformation of our sidewalks to Garden Centers. We have a substantial runway for growth ahead of us as we still have 70% of the chain to convert to the Fusion layout and the opportunity for another 1,000 plus Garden Center transformations. The comp lift for the Fusion remodels continues to run in the mid-single digits. When we execute a combination Fusion remodel and a Garden Center transformation of our sidelight, we have a comp lift in the high single digits. These projects provide us with the opportunity to continue our track record of consistent growth. The second word I would use to describe Tractor Supply is reliable. We are a need space, demand-driven business, and these product categories differentiate Tractor Supply from the bulk of retail. Our customers count on us for the products they need to deliver Life Out Here. Since relaunching our Neighbor\u2019s Club program in April of 2021, we have increased our high value customers by nearly 50%. Additionally, our high value customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more money. Our retention rate for our high value customers is about 80% with our retention rate for our highest tier customers at over 95%. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program is a true competitive advantage for Tractor Supply. Once our customers in the flywheel of Neighbor\u2019s Club, their spending becomes much more reliable. Sustainable is the third key word to characterize our company. We\u2019ve had tens of millions of new customers shop us the past three years. We have retained the majority of these customers and a substantial portion have become active Neighbor\u2019s Club members. We\u2019ve added over 13 million members since 2019 with more than 5 million in 2022 alone. These strong results position us for sustainable growth ahead. Another important customer cohort that supports the sustainability of our outlook are the millennial customers and they continue to have more significant spending with us and in the years ahead of them. This group will make out nearly a quarter of the U.S. population by 2032, just 10 years from now. Our sales comps for millennials have outpaced non-millennials at Tractor Supply for five consecutive years, millennials over index and sales per customer, units per customer and average ticket. We view this strength that our millennial customer, not as a pull board, but rather as a catch up, as this group delayed family formation and the pandemic really shifted their behaviors to be much like prior generations. This cohort of the population is showing accelerated rates of home ownership and household formation. Today, 50% of millennials own homes versus 30% just a decade ago. So while they may have started a little bit later, we see an inflection point in the pace of home ownership and household formation for millennials. We are focused on retaining these new millennial customers as our data shows that they are roughly double their spending at TSC in their second year of shopping. And if they continue shopping with us for five years, we experience a threefold increase in transactions and sales per customer within five years of their initial purchase. Rural revitalization also continues to be a strong structural benefit for us. Millennials are increasingly choosing to move out here. This is not just a phenomenon of the pandemic, but rather a decade long trend of net migration out of urban areas that skewed disproportionately among this younger generation. The rural lifestyle appeals to millennials and it offers greater affordability, safety, self-sufficiency of slower pace, and the ability to pursue hobbies and passions. Many of the hobbies pursued by the millennials fit with our Out Here lifestyle. Tractor Supply enables passions and hobbies pursued by millennials, whether it is a pursuit as simple as making memories with family and friends or caring for pets and animals, or getting outside to hunt fish or camp, or being more self-sufficient and sustainable. Tractor Supply serves a key resource in our local communities for millennials to come to for trusted advice and expertise. Our passion for the lifestyle connects with our customers and allows us to serve them at scale. These three words, consistent, reliable and sustainable allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. As I started my remarks this morning, year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, but more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead and to focus on the opportunities ahead of us. With our Life Out Here strategy, we have ignited Tractor Supply\u2019s next horizon of strong and sustainable growth. 2023 is poised to be another great year for Tractor Supply. And with that operator, we now like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot, your line is now open. Joe Civello : Hi. This is Joe Civello on for Scot. Great quarter guys. I was just wondering if we could talk about your \u2013 the transaction growth you guys are projecting for 2023. Can you talk about how the expectations are driven by weaker comps, weather driven or other things like that, or potentially incremental visits driven by Garden Centers, Fusion remodels or the things you\u2019re implementing in the store that\u2019s helping to drive growth? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Yes. Good morning and thanks for your question. Appreciate you joining the call today. We\u2019re very pleased with the guidance we provided on our comp sales for 2023 to be between 3.5% and 5.5%, very much in line with our long-term guidance range as well. As Kurt said in his prepared remarks, we expect it\u2019ll be a blend of transacts \u2013 positive comp transactions and ticket. We do expect inflation will be stronger in the first half, but moderate in the second half. And what I\u2019d say more broadly is, our market that we participate in continues to run reasonably in line with GDP kind of flat to low single digit growth. And we are taking significant share in the marketplace. As we\u2019ve said several times over the last three years, our sales growth, half of that can be attributable to share gain. And we certainly are expecting that to continue in 2023. And the share gain is really a composition of the competitive advantages that we have as well as the investments we\u2019re making in our Life Out Here strategy and the fact that we\u2019re reaching scale on a number of those now, particularly our Fusion and Garden Centers. And they will continue to add material growth to our comps. But again, we\u2019re very positive on our outlook for 2023 and expect the momentum that we exited 2022 to continue into the year. Joe Civello : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Karen, your line is now open. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good to talk to you again. So just two questions if I could blend them in. So, just looking at your algorithm, obviously you\u2019re looking for sales growth just on a one year basis to be lower than EBIT growth. And I guess I would argue that\u2019s probably \u2013 sorry, sales growth to be higher than EBIT growth. And I would look at that as a good thing because you are one of the few companies that have invested and not harvested as it relates to the pandemic. So maybe just talk about that algorithm. And then the second question I just wanted to lump in there, when you look at your mix by category, obviously I kind of look at it at about 26% is discretionary. So how do you think about that going into potentially a weaker macro? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Liz, good morning and thanks for taking the call. I\u2019m sorry, Karen, I apologize, Karen. Karen, how are you this morning? Good morning. You all are right beside each other your name\u2019s alphabetically on my list, so my apologies. But Karen good morning and thanks for your question for joining the call. On the sales growth, as you said, we are in an investment cycle in our business and the thing that we\u2019re excited about is that we\u2019re able to grow earnings as we did last year double digits, and we\u2019re able to grow our sales as we did last year double digits even in the context of an earnings cycle. And we anticipate to continue to grow sales at a significant rate next year as well as our earnings at a significant rate next year, even inclusive of all the capital expenditure and kind of underlying DNA that comes along with that, as well as all the other investments we\u2019re making in the business. But we\u2019re very optimistic and confident in the outlook that we\u2019ve provided. On the mix by category, we\u2019ve roughly talked about discretionary being more like 15% of our business. Big ticket is kind of in the low double digits. There\u2019s a few other categories that would be plus or minus in that discretionary area as well. And I think the way we think about that business is that some categories will have - continue to be negative in their comps but there\u2019s others when it\u2019s seasonally relevant that will be positive. And an example of that is what Kurt articulated in his prepared remarks saying that, our big ticket sales were kind of mid-single digit negative comps. And it was really \u2013 there was two sets of categories in there. The kind of discretionary non-seasonal related ones were kind of negative double digits, but then you had ones that were seasonally relevant and there was a demand around those say like log splitters and snow throwers that are also big ticket and could be viewed as discretionary or in our kind of math for discretionary and those blended together to drive a negative single digit \u2013 mid single digit comp. And we think it\u2019ll play out that way much of this year. As an example, as we get into the end of Q1 and early Q2 when we had the drought last year that disproportionately affected as we commented last year, things like riders. And we expect those to come back as the drought is abetting in many areas of the country even in spite of the consumer shifting more towards needs based needs based spend. Anyway, thanks Karen, for joining the call. I appreciate the question. Karen Short : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes on the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Liz, your line is now open. Liz Suzuki : Thank you. And I don\u2019t mind being confused for Karen because she dresses better than I do, so I appreciate it. Thanks for your time. Yes. So the guidance you gave for 2023 and in terms of the operating margin, I guess, it sounds like the investments in new DCs and in store transformations and side lots are probably the factors that would keep that margin towards the lower end at the long-term guidance. But what do you view as the opportunities for operating margin to get to the top end of that guidance over time? Hal Lawton : Yes, hey Liz. And good morning, and thanks for joining the call. As we've said several times, last year and this year are two biggest peaks in investments. And as we talked about in our enhanced earnings calls a couple of years ago, the first part of this five-year cycle that we're in for our Life Out Here strategy would be towards more the bottom end of our \u2013 middle end of our range. And then as we move towards the out years, call it, 2024, 2025, 2026, we see opportunities to increment up on our op margin towards that higher end and kind of get back to a nice leverage across our P&L, let's say, 5 or 10 basis points a year. And really, the biggest determinant of the 10.1% to 10.3% this year would just be the sales range. And if we're up more towards the 5.5, we would expect to leverage more on some of our fixed costs and be more towards that 10.3%. If we're down more towards the 3.5%, we think we'll be more in that 10.1% to 10.2% range as there's a little less leverage on some of our fixed costs. We pull some other levers to kind of manage the business. But certainly, as we look out towards the back half of this five-year investment cycle, we see opportunities for our margin rate to increment up. Liz Suzuki : Got it. And just a follow-up, you may have mentioned this in the outlook for 2023, how many Project Fusion remodels and side lots do you have baked in? Hal Lawton : Yes. So the mix of our remodels in 2023 will be a little different than last year because of the Orscheln acquisition. This year, as we shared in our opening remarks, it's kind of 70 to 80-ish new stores that will open this year. We'll also be integrating the 81 Orscheln stores. Those will be kind of basically a Fusion remodel. And then we'll do around 150 more Fusion remodels as well. And that's in line with what we did this year, kind of in that 200 to 250 range. It's just the fact that 80 of those will be taken up by the Orscheln integration this year. We continue to be very excited about Fusion and very excited about our side lots. Go ahead, Liz. Liz Suzuki : Yes, excited to see you next week. Thanks. Hal Lawton : Yes, perfect. Look forward to seeing you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is now open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Great quarter, congratulations. So I have two quick questions. I'll merge them into one. First off, with regard to the sort of say, the weather bump in sales late in Q4, should we think about that as incremental demand? Or does that potentially pull forward demand would have happened in Q1? And then the second question I have, Kurt, you mentioned in your script, that you're seeing, I guess, price increases moderate and that's from your suppliers. The first I have is, so then what action \u2013 that's occurring, what action is Tractor Supply taking? Are you maintaining your retail prices? Or are you actually adjusting your retail prices to account for those now modeling input costs? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Yes, hey, Brian, I'll take the first part of it, and then Kurt will take the second part. On the weather bump, we don't see that as pull forward from Q1. And we see it \u2013 dominantly, it's just incremental in Q4. I'd go back to some of the comments we made, say, in our Q3 earnings call and our Q2 earnings call, where we said, our business has been very consistent in that 5% to 6% comp range all last year. And as Kurt said in his prepared remarks, and I think I did as well, we were trending towards the high end of our comp guidance for Q4 when the storm hit and then that put us well over. I'd equated a bit to what we said if we had gotten \u2013 if the drought hadn't occurred, we think we would have been over our guidance. If we'd had a better spring season, we think we would have been over our guidance for those quarters. I just get back to the point, our business is very consistent, very stable, very reliable right now in that kind of mid single-digits. And then if we get some good weather on top of that, that benefits us, we get that benefit. And that's what we saw in Q4. When the weather is bad, we're there for our customers. And it drives some sales. But otherwise, we continue to run very reliably and consistently in that mid single-digit comps. Kurt Barton : Yes, Brian, good morning. And I'll just add to that. On that winter storm, we view it very much like a discrete event like the hurricane events have been. You heard my commentary on there. The exciting thing though is, with those types of events, consistent with this storm is it introduces Tractor Supply as a needs-based business to other new customers. And that's what we do as we capitalize on that, we see it as part of our opportunity in 2023 as new footsteps into the business. So great opportunity from that one event as we continue to serve our markets in a significant widespread winter storms such as that. In regards to your question about prices abating and how we manage that, one is, we will \u2013 those prices will take time to work through the system. So we do very well at managing whether that be the product cost or the transportation to be able to manage as those flow through and balance between the competitive retail price that we have, gaining market share and how much we actually take to the bottom line. Specifically, the biggest item in the gross margin benefit in 2023 is the easing of the transportation cost. And as you look back even over the last two years, on our gross margin, we've been very specific as we've been able to find offsets or pass through some of those the transportation cost has been the primary one where we've absorbed some of that. And so we will \u2013 as those prices abate and ease through, it's a key contributor to how we expect to see gross margin expansion throughout 2023. Brian Nagel : Thanks guys, very helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. Nice results. My question, it's a couple of parts, but it's one topic. It's how C.U.E. is comping 3x the company average. If you could speak to \u2013 if you can, maybe the price benefit there or what's happening with the basket and the market share seems to be staggering because I don't think some of the items in that category are growing that fast. And then I'll flip it and say then why are you not converting or is it converting to the rest of the store? Are you seeing that conversion? Because it seems like it's a pretty good halo to have on one side of the business. Hal Lawton : Yes, hey Simeon, and thanks for joining the call. Good to speak to you this morning. On the C.U.E., I would say our AUR is in line with the rest of the market. So kind of high single-digits, generally speaking, across food and speed, but our market share is on a dollar basis, we\u2019re running 2x the market. And on a pound basis, we\u2019re running 3x the market in growth. And so it\u2019s \u2013 the majority of our growth there well over half is transactions-based, unit-based and share gain. And dog dry food is the numbers I was just mentioning right there, those were specific to that to dog dry food. But we\u2019re seeing similar type of numbers in poultry feed, in equine feed, in livestock, et cetera. And I would say it is pulling through to the rest of our business, in terms of driving positive footsteps and transactions into our store. And then also, our average ticket continues to remain very solid with very modest reduction in our UPT. In fact, this was the lowest year-over-year in our UPT decline in 2022. And when you look at the customer \u2013 underlying customer cohorts in our Neighbor\u2019s Club program, what you\u2019re seeing and as was mentioned in the prepared remarks is that the millennials have moved out to kind of rural America and kind of that Sunbelt migration, they start in poultry and pet food with us and then very quickly are migrating into four to five other categories in terms of us being their destination. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing strong growth, its market share gains in C.U.E. that we\u2019re taking. We\u2019re confident we will be able to continue to take those gains. We are the lowest cost to serve in the market, the fastest supply chain, the lowest price is the best customer service. And when they get in there, should they shop the whole lifestyle, and we\u2019re seeing that in our average ticket and also in our on customer data. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is now open. Zach Fadem : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions on the outlook. First of all, could you walk us through the quarterly comp impact from the calendar shift? And if there\u2019s anything we need to keep in mind on a flow-through or margin basis for those sales. And then second, on your gross margin outlook. To what extent are you incorporating reinvestment to drive traffic growth versus flowing those lower freight input cost to the bottom line? Kurt Barton : Zack, hey, this is Kurt. The first question in regards to cadence throughout the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the \u2013 all four quarters really would expect to be in line with our overall guidance. We don\u2019t expect significant variation between the quarters. I would encourage you, as you reflect back on last year, as we talked about some of the headwinds we saw in the middle parts of the year, with the late start to the spring, the drought that impacted Q2 and Q3. We talked about how in those quarters, there were some headwinds that took some of the top side off of the comps in those quarters. So we see good opportunity to be able to capitalize comping up against those quarters. We obviously had a really strong Q4. We talked about the winter storm. So those are all things that factor into our model as we plan the comps. And on the gross margin question, maybe remind me again your question on the gross margin. Zach Fadem : Yes. Are you incorporating any reinvestment to drive traffic growth versus just flowing the lower freight to the bottom line? Kurt Barton : Got you. Yes. Well, of course, we always prioritize market share gains competitive in pricing. We are the lowest cost to serve. We\u2019ve invested in our supply chain and distribution to be able to capitalize on this shift in the environment where transportations are coming down. So we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of our own efficiencies that we can control. As there\u2019s opportunities as prices decline, we will take some opportunity modest as we see it in our plan, opportunity to invest in the gross margin. And all of that is considered in our expectation that we could see gross margin growing 20 basis points to 40 basis points in 2023. Zach Fadem : And Kurt, just to clarify, the calendar shift won\u2019t be as pronounced as 2016 is what it sounds like. Kurt Barton : Exactly. Yes. Thank you. There is not a pronouncement, anything of material. And I\u2019d just point back to how consistent each of the quarters were in 2023. So there\u2019s really no meaningful shift in there. Zach Fadem : Got it. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up on the sort of discretionary question that was posed earlier by Karen. As you think about what you saw in the fourth quarter, you\u2019re hearing a lot of retailers talk about a very late Christmas season. And I recognize it\u2019s a small portion of your mix. But in some of those seasonal categories, let\u2019s say, fashion apparel and footwear and toys, did you see any sort of like deterioration? And then similarly, if you look at the data around pet inflation that\u2019s been very strong, but it does seem like there\u2019s some unit degradation and some sort of sacrifice same streets and the accessory business. So can you talk about those two buckets in terms of how that behavior has changed, I guess in the back half of the year in the fourth quarter? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Chris, and good morning. Thanks for your question and for joining the call. First, we were very pleased with our Q4 business in general. As I said and Kurt, absent the storm, we were still at the high end of our comp expectations and we would have still had positive comp transactions for the quarter regardless of the storm. And we were also very pleased with our seasonal businesses. They performed in line with our expectations. And then in the last week of right before Christmas, for us, when we have a winter storm like that, it drives more footsteps into our stores, and they end up shopping the entire lifestyle when they\u2019re in there. So we saw excellent performance that week. And in holiday-related items, whether it\u2019s in apparel, whether it was in decor, candy, toys, tools. It was a solid, very solid close to the year for us on both, as I said, not only just on demand-driven store-related items. And then on pet, we are seeing unit growth and double-digit comps across all categories in pet, whether it\u2019s dog, whether it\u2019s cat, whether it\u2019s hard goods, whether it\u2019s consumables, whether it\u2019s food, whether it\u2019s sundries or accessories. Certainly, the food is outpacing the other categories, but all categories in our pet business are seeing very strong growth. Chris Horvers : Very impressive. Thanks very much. Mary Winn Pilkington : So we\u2019ve hit the top of the hour, but we\u2019ll let the call go just a few minutes longer because our prepared remarks were longer. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Steven, your line is now open. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Hal, Kurt, Mary. I wanted to focus on member cohort trends. So you mentioned, I think, during the prepared remarks, retention rates right among the high-value customers. I was curious if you could expand on retention, repeat behavior sort of in aggregate across the member cohorts as a whole and whether you\u2019re seeing a difference in behaviors right, between those members acquired over the past three years versus those members acquired 2019 earlier. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Steven, and good morning. This is a great new story for Tractor Supply. What I\u2019ve seen historically in my career in retail is it takes time when you have a new customer for them to ramp up through your high-spending cohorts until they become kind of a mature customer. What we\u2019ve seen is the customers, as you mentioned, I said in my prepared remarks, that we\u2019ve had tens of millions of new customers shop us in the last three years. The majority of those have continued to be active shoppers with us and a huge portion had become Neighbor\u2019s Club members. That cohort is basically shopping us, and we\u2019re seeing purchase frequency, average ticket, number of categories shop total spend in the year, very much in line with our kind of long-time core customers. So they\u2019ve ramped up very fast. And that\u2019s why when we say things like our Neighbor\u2019s Club is outperforming our overall comp, our total company comp, even at 75% penetration. And even with the growth we\u2019ve had, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so exceptional because historically, in my past, as you see your membership program becomes such a large portion of your sales is a tendency revert to the mean, right, revert your overall comp. And I think the data set you can see both that we\u2019re providing also an underlying data just shows you how fast those customers have ramped up and become core customers for us. And it\u2019s what gives us confidence as we head into 2023. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Best of luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Peter, your line is now open. Peter Keith : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. One thing that we\u2019re hearing in the channel right now, and it\u2019s kind of a funny dynamic for Farm and Ranch, but that the chicken category is on fire. And certainly, there\u2019s been some well-publicized discussion of price increases with eggs. So I guess I\u2019m wondering, is that a kind of an emerging trend that chickens have perhaps reaccelerated for you. And is that a category that actually could be big enough to move the needle as we look at 2023? Seth Estep : Hey, Peter, this is Seth. Thanks for the question. Yes, when we look ahead to this next year, we are incredibly excited about our poultry business. And just to go back to some of Hal\u2019s comments earlier, I would just say even in Q4 for us, poultry was a primary driver. We have \u2013 unlike some maybe commentary you\u2019ve heard elsewhere, we have not seen the entire year over the course of the last three years, any slowdown in our poultry business. And when we look ahead to this year, we think it could be another record year for us. Our stores are setting chick days here over the coming months. When we look out to our center court activity. We look at poultry being a predominant driver for us. And when you couple those things with our pet business, you couple those with our live goods business, all the sustainability things that customers are looking for right now is they\u2019re looking to find value, to grow those things on their own. We\u2019re looking at poultry to be just absolutely another banner year and our team is incredibly excited for that. So we definitely agree with the commentary you\u2019re hearing out there, and we think we\u2019re in a position to continue to take market share in this category. Peter Keith : All right. Thanks and congrats on the continued success. Hal Lawton : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter, your line is now open. Peter Benedict : Hey guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. I just wanted to ask a question around CapEx, came in above the forecast this past year. Curious if that\u2019s just projects costing more? Or did you get through more of the projects than you thought? And then as you step back, CapEx is running around 5% of sales in the last couple of years. I think your outlook for 2023 would suggest a similar ratio. How do we think about the path of CapEx beyond 2023? Historically, you guys used to run around 3% of sales. You\u2019ve been investing aggressively for good reason. But just curious how you would think about maybe the CapEx path as we move beyond 2023. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Hey, Peter, this is Kurt. In regards to CapEx and your two questions, the growth in CapEx in 2022 at the high end of our expectations reflected a couple of things. Certainly, there\u2019s inflation in the cost of building a distribution center, the new stores, et cetera, that was a piece of it. But also in this environment, the team has done an excellent job of ramping up and ensuring that all of the pieces that go into these fusion remodels that we\u2019ve got the fixtures and all of the equipment ready to go. So the pipeline is in good shape for what we plan to use to grow into the 200 to 250 remodeled stores next year. And there\u2019s some timing of that capital that impacted 2022. And then certainly, for 2023, we expect consistent numbers. We\u2019ve got a construction of a complete new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. So for both years, they absorbed the $150 million-ish cost of some of our largest distribution centers in those years. And that leads to the second question that you had going forward, we really believe that as we said, these would be the two peak years that the biggest investment over the other years is really on the supply chain side. And it\u2019s reverting back more to that over the next few years, $600 million, $650 million in capital going forward. And it\u2019s a very planned, purposeful five-year growth to convert the supply chain and the stores into the new Life Out Here strategy, look and shopping experience for our customers. So I would expect to see that number come down a bit after 2023. Peter Benedict : That\u2019s great. Very helpful. Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Sure thing. For that, we\u2019ll wrap up our call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter earnings call in April. I\u2019m around. If anybody wants to reach out, please let me know and we\u2019ll get you on the calendar. Thank you all. Have a great day.

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For today's call, I will go through some highlights of our first quarter. Seth will then share some merchandising initiatives and updates and Kurt will review the quarter and our outlook in greater detail. Before we get started, I'd like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. No matter the operating environment or how the seasons of the year unfold, this is a team that is always there for our customers and our communities to be the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. For nearly 85 years, our business has proven to be resilient, stable and very consistent, as we provide needs-based, demand-driven product categories as a lifestyle retailer. Now, let's turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2023. We grew net sales by nearly double digits at 9.1%, with comparable stores up 2.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.65. We had 7 points of non-comp sales growth in the quarter. The two primary drivers were new stores and the Orscheln acquisition. We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and the Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. And the Orscheln integration is running ahead of schedule. Our comp sales results were below our expectations. We attribute just over 200 basis points, the majority of our sales miss to a delayed start to the spring and to a lesser extent, a milder January. We continue to closely review customer data for trends and changes in their behavior. While select discretionary categories were below in the chain average, this was offset by stronger demand in our consumable, usable and edible products. We believe our customers remain resilient, but are being judicious with their spending as they seek us out as a destination for value and are buying closer to need. Excluding our seasonal categories, our sales were in line with our expectations, and our core business remains very strong. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by ticket growth of 2.8%, offset by a decline in transactions of 0.7%. Importantly, our comp transaction trends improved each month of the quarter and were positive in February and March, with strong performance in our year-round categories. The strength in our year-round categories was driven by CUE products, which exhibited ongoing impressive demand this quarter. These products are needs-based and demand driven and are what drive trips and transactions to our stores. Across companion animal and livestock, we had strong performance. The strength we've experienced over the last three years in our CUE customer trends remains robust, as we continue to gain material market share. In companion animal, we continue to see substantial share gains throughout the category. And we're seeing sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week, each month, each quarter. In livestock, our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for us, with the poultry category up strong double digits. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we're also seeing robust growth in new customers to the category, driving both trips and ticket. One exciting aspect of the new customers to the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and use this as a resource for all things related to homesteading, beyond poultry to categories like gardening. Big ticket declines were driven by seasonal trends and to a lesser degree, ongoing pullback in discretionary categories. The slow start to spring impacted outdoor power equipment, which weighed on our big ticket results and average ticket. The most significant pressure was in zero-turn tractors, generators and trailers. Our customers have a long history of buying these items based on need. Current trends support that we are seeing purchasing consistently closer to the season or moment in need. Overall, our big ticket trends were very similar to what has been reported in the recent March retail sales data. Our mobile app currently represents more than 20% of our digital sales. The app is now ranked in the top 100 shopping apps on the iOS store. This is a major recognition of the progress in our ONETractor strategy to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our customer scores continue to run at all-time highs. Overall, our customer experience metrics continue to keep momentum into 2023, with strong improvements over the last quarter and year-over-year. Our store teams are doing a tremendous job servicing our customers. Our Neighbor's Club just celebrated last week a significant milestone with over 30 million members. As our points-based program enters its third year, the strength in Neighbor's Club continues to exceed our expectations. Our members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance, and we continue to see strong growth and retention in our high-value customers. As mentioned previously, the Orscheln Farm and Home integration is going very well. I had the opportunity recently to visit one of our first store conversions to the Tractor Supply brand. There was excitement across both our team members and, importantly, our customers as they recognize that we're committed to providing the region with an elevated product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer. During the quarter, we opened our ninth and largest distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. The ramp of the distribution center is right on schedule. With the opening in the new DC, the integration of 81 Orscheln stores and addition of new TSC stores, we capitalized on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service those stores, and allow us to reduce our freight costs, which you'll hear more about from Kurt. At Tractor Supply, our purpose as a company is to serve Life Out Here. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to preserve and protect our way of life. Two weeks ago, we issued our fourth annual Stewardship Tear Sheet, highlighting the actions and progress that we've made on our sustainability, DE&I and community commitments. I am proud of our progress towards our ambitious stewardship goals, but know there is more to be done as we work towards achieving our net-zero and other goals heading towards 2040. To wrap up, while our first quarter sales were below our expectations, we have a lot of the year still ahead of us. The American consumer broadly remains challenged, but we believe that our customer remains resilient. Spring continues to be cooler and wetter as we've turned into Q2. That said, we're encouraged by quarter-to-date trends, with comps mid-single digit and comp transactions positive. Based on our experience and the nature of our needs-based demand-driven business, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half, as the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. While we acknowledge that the softer sales in January will not be recouped, we are pleased with our lineup for spring and summer. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth and earnings growth as well. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2023. Before I turn the call over to Seth, I'd like to share some background on Seth and the merchandising team at Tractor Supply. Seth is an 18-year veteran of Tractor Supply, having held roles across marketing, finance, e-commerce and merchandising. He has a passion for this lifestyle and has served as our Chief Merchant since 2020. Given our record sales growth over the last three years, we recently completed a realignment of our merchandising product categories and promoted two Vice Presidents to Senior Vice Presidents to better support the growing needs of our business. Seth will provide a review of our sales by category and our plans to continue to gain market share. Now, I'll turn the call over to Seth to discuss some further insights. Seth Estep : Thank you, Hal. I'm excited to share with you some insights into our merchandising categories and market share position. We are committed to driving sales productivity as we deepen our relationships with our customers. I'd like to start by congratulating Nicole Logan, SVP of Animal and Softline divisions; and Randall Dodds, SVP of Seasonal and Hardline divisions on the recent promotions. They each bring significant retail and industry experience that complement their tenure at Tractor Supply. These new roles each have three merchandising divisions reporting to each of them. It is exciting to have this new organizational structure to allow us to operate at greater scale, have deeper category insights and enhanced strategic partnerships. Overall, we're now organized into six merchandising divisions. So let's start with our largest division, companion animal, that represents more than 20% of our 2022 sales. This business includes both the consumables and hard lines across companion animal. Around 75% of the Tractor Supply customers have a pet, and approximately 50% have more than one pet. Also, our customers dog weight on average about 20 pounds more than the US average. With the ongoing humanization of companion animals, these key structural tailwinds support our positive outlook on this category. We are a destination for pet customers, with a comprehensive and differentiated assortment at an everyday low price, and we continue to gain share. For example, our growth in pet food, treats and litter continues to lead the market in both dollar and pound growth, gaining another 33 basis points of share in Q1. Our business model of private brands, strong national and differentiated partners, club pack sizes and legendary customer service sets us up to continue gaining share, perhaps even more if we see the consumer more pressured for value. Moving on to our second largest division, livestock and equine, which represents just under 20% of sells. This is a key category for farm and ranch, and we continue to consistently outperform the market. Of note, this category is almost solely the consumables portion of our lifestyle seed categories. In other words, this business does not include fencing, which, in many ways, can be considered containment for large animals. With strong exclusive brands like DuMOR and Producer's Pride, along with national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more, we continue to innovate across our key categories of poultry, equine and cattle. We are the clear leader in this space, with approximately 20% market share. Broadly, one out of every five bags of animal feed is bought at Tractor Supply, and we continue to take share, consistently outperforming the market by 5 percentage points. Next up in our category lineup at an equal weighting are our seasonal and our truck tool and hardware divisions. We are excited to get our spring seasonal business off and running. This is an area where we think we have substantial share opportunities. We are a leader in core categories like outdoor power as the destination for Zero Turn Mowers and categories like grass feed and fertilizers. Also, our live goods assortment is included in this division. As of today, we have more than 350 garden centers ready for spring, with the vast majority just entering year two of operations. Where spring weather has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers' response to the expanded product offering and layout in our Fusion and Garden Center stores. More broadly, this season, we are offering a differentiated garden assortment of live goods, including vegetables and plants, soils, mulch, and chemicals tailored to Life Out Here. We like our initial reads for seasonal products where the weather has turned and are excited for the spring season. Our fourth division is truck, tool and hardware that includes lifestyle items like trailers, power tools, welders and truck accessories. Historically, in tools, we have serviced as a convenience play in power tools and hardware. As part of our Fusion layout, we have made significant investments in corresponding progress on elevating our power tool selection, and it has resulted in one of the highest sales lift categories in our Fusion stores. The additions of Makita, Bosch and Dremel, coupled with being the exclusive retail destination for Porter-Cable power tools, has allowed us to have consistent share gains over the last three years. Up next is our Ag and Outdoor Recreation division, which includes categories such as fencing and sprayers as well as our outdoor sport categories. We are in the business of helping people maintain their land and contain their animals. We have the largest share in the country and have outgrown the market by mid-single digits. And for outdoor recreation, we are very excited about the growth prospects for this segment as we test an expanded assortment in several Orscheln Farm and Home stores. Our final segment ranked on sales volume is clothing and decor, which has exhibited rapid growth since the pandemic, trending well above the company average. This business includes apparel, footwear and farmhouse decor. As one of the largest retailers of Carhartt, along with other brands like Wrangler and Colombia, our customers are finding our assortment meets their workwear needs and their lifestyle. For years, we've known there was a market opportunity in women's workwear at Tractor Supply. And the team has leaned into this category, and the shopper is responding. While still off a relatively small base, our women's apparel business grew 24% in Q1, led by growth in our exclusive brands of Blue Mountain and Ridgecut. We will continue to look for ways to grow these high-margin categories by growing both leading national and best-in-class exclusive brands. In closing, with our new alignment and additional resources, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to be the market leader and operate with speed, agility and efficiency to capture growth and drive sales productivity. We are in the midst of one of the most exciting times at Tractor Supply as we are in the spring season. And I hope you get a chance to get out to our stores and see all the exciting merchandising experiences and product innovation. Now, I'll turn it over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Seth, and hello to everyone on the call. I will add on to Hal's comments about the quarter and our outlook for the year. Let's start with our first quarter results. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a soft January. Last year's January was strong, so we expect it to start soft, but we did not anticipate that the month would be the second warmest in 30-plus years. February was more normalized and in line with our expectations, but the mild winter continued to pressure results. To put it in perspective, our heating categories were down nearly 50%, insulated outerwear was down over 30% and emergency response categories were also down significantly. As a result, our winter seasonal products were down double digits for the quarter. Our expectation was that as we moved through the quarter, we would see a more normalized spring selling season unfold, where we saw the majority of the shortfall was really in the last three weeks of March, which were abnormally wet and much cooler than normal, as well as winter weather continued in the Midwest and Northeast. To put it in historical context, March was the coldest in four years with below-average temperatures nationally, the wettest in eight years and the snowiest in 30 years. Correspondingly, our spring seasonal products were flat to the prior year, well below our expectations. Sales in the quarter benefited in the high-single digits from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price changes that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not lapped as of yet. The benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by three key factors : First, the majority of the pressure on average ticket all revolved around seasonal goods. This includes the softness in big ticket, declines in seasonal, which runs at a higher average ticket and higher winter clearance. Second, faster growth in consumable transactions, in particular companion animal and poultry, which typically have a lower average ticket. And then third, to a lesser extent, a reduction in units per transaction in impulser add-on items like dog treats and candy and snacks. Moving down our income statement. Gross margin was 35.5%, an increase of 52 basis points from 34.9% last year. We were very pleased with these results. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. Promotional activity was in line with last year with a modest increase in winter clearance, as we looked to exit the season clean. Moderating freight costs for import and domestic shipments provided a net gross margin benefit. Our price management initiatives and lower freight costs more than offset the impact from cost inflation and product mix from the robust growth of our CUE categories. As a percent of sales, SG& A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 119 basis points to 28.1% from 26.9% a year ago. For perspective, about half of this growth was anticipated for our strategic initiatives. As a reminder, our planned investments included higher depreciation and amortization from the step-up in capital spending to support our growth agenda, and the addition of our new distribution center and the impact from the Orscheln acquisition. The remaining increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to deleverage, given the moderate comparable store sales growth. As we've mentioned, the quarter was trending in line with our expectations, leading up to the last three weeks of March, providing limited opportunities to adjust the cost structure. Specifically, we chose to continue to fully fund payroll for the last two weeks of the quarter to support the spring season, utilizing the hours to get ahead on product assembly and other sales driving tasks. For the quarter, operating income was essentially flat with last year, with a modest decline in net income. Diluted EPS was $1.65, also flat with the prior year's first quarter. We opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the first quarter. This represents a significant improvement in the cadence of our new store openings. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 12% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, a better in-stock position from last year and the delay in the spring selling season. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet, with a leverage ratio of around 2.0 times. Our guidance for 2023 is unchanged. We continue to expect full year sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion and project comparable store sales to increase 3.5% to 5.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see comp sales towards the top half of our guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate some increased pressure on discretionary categories, but are pleased with the growth in CUE products along with DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Let me share further insights on the outlook for the remainder of the year. We anticipate Q2 and Q3 to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while Q4 is expected to be closer to the low end of the guidance range due to the strong compares to the prior year. Operating margin performance is expected to improve as we move through the year with Q4 having the highest potential, principally from the lap of the onetime acquisition-related costs of Orscheln. As a reminder, our Novar, Ohio, distribution center is expected to begin to benefit gross margin in the second quarter with the ramp up in the second half of the year as we capture freight savings. The benefits in gross margin will be offset by approximately 15 basis points of negative drag on SG&A as the cost of the distribution center are reflected in SG&A. We have confidence in our earnings in a variety of sales scenarios. For example, at times, a cooler and wetter start to the spring can provide an extended selling season. We've seen this type of seasonal cadence before such as 2013, and we are cautiously optimistic of the upside it can bring to the third quarter. Regardless of the state of the consumer, we are confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to manage the business. In a scenario where we do not make up miss January sales, we see opportunities for further operating leverage. Specifically, we are seeing an easing of our supply chain capacity constraints, which should drive additional efficiencies in the second half. And we now anticipate greater accretion for porcelains in the back half. We are raising our accretion assumption to $0.15 per share compared to our prior expectation of $0.10 per share. To sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.13 billion to $1.17 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $10.30 to $10.60. Over my 23 years with Tractor Supply, it has been proven time after time weather can be transitory. And the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. Throughout our 85-year history, we have successfully navigated all types of business environments and have emerged stronger each time. We continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. This marks the third consecutive year of positive population growth in rural America. This reflects an increased desire to seek out more space and take advantage of the affordability that country suburban, exurban and rural markets offer with a lower cost of living and the ability to live Life Out Here. It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price, has ensured the rural migration trend is one that's here to stay for the time being. The millennial generation has embraced Life Out Here. Our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower macroeconomic growth, elevated inflation and higher interest rates, and they prioritize their lifestyle and passions. With significant growth and market share opportunities, we are excited about the balance of the year and remain confident in our business. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission values every day. And now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you so much. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. You may proceed. Steven Zaccone : Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start just thinking about the context of the year. So given the slightly weaker-than-expected same-store sales in the first quarter, can you just talk about the confidence to recover these spring sales over the balance of the year? It sounds like January can't be made up, but how material is that for the full year? And then just you sounded a bit more cautious on discretionary from what you've seen from your consumers. So just elaborate on how much that could be an impact to the full year. Thanks very much. Hal Lawton : Yes. Stephen. Good morning, it's Hal, and thanks for your question. Thanks for joining our call. We remain very confident in our sales guidance or in our earnings guidance for the year. As we've stated on the call, about 200 basis points of our -- we were below our sales comp expectations by about 200 basis points due to weather. About 80% of that was due to the spring/fall off in the last three weeks of the quarter with about 20% of that being in January. So January is a much smaller component, particularly when you look at it over the fullness of the year. As Kurt said, there are a number of ways that we see path to recovering not only the Spring sales but potentially the winter sales as the year progress. As we mentioned in the year 2013, and there are several other years that have similar profiles where you've got a cooler weather spring, that has pushed the season into the summer time as yards remain, kind of, remain green and growing, past years remain growing cultivation in farms continue to happen, and our business remains strong into those years into those months. In particular, if you recall last year, in the midst of summer, we had one in 10-year drought. So the lapping of that looks very promising. On the consumer more broadly, we've not seen a sequential change in consumer behavior from Q3 and Q4 last year into Q1 of this year. The same themes that we were sharing last year are the same themes that we would reiterate here on this call. Discretionary, which only represents 15% of our business, continues to perform under average. That -- the pace of that is about the same as it was in Q3 and Q4. Our units per transaction continued to face modest pressure, low single-digits as consumers continue to be judicious in their basket. But that's -- we've been calling that out for the last couple of quarters. But otherwise, we've really not seen any sequential change in consumer spending. There are some categories where we're seeing spend, consumer shift up in their spend in poultry, our organic fee continues to be the strongest kind of, segment in our feed. In dog food, we are seeing economy continue to be strong, but that's actually due to the increased customers that Seth called out. If you look at our core customer base from one year ago and two years ago, they haven't changed at all their food buying behavior. So really not a lot of change in the consumer behavior from last year. Big ticket continues to run about the same. The January falloff was measurable but small. And really, it came down to the last 3 weeks of the quarter, which were cooler, wetter and snowier than we anticipated on top of an underperforming spring last year. Steven Zaccone : Great. Thanks for all the detail. I\u2019ll leave the floor. Hal Lawton : Yes. Thanks, Steven Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. You may proceed. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. It\u2019s Scot Ciccarelli. And how this may be a function of my stating memory. But I don't recall you guys talking about customers buying closer to need before. So if I'm wrong about that, I apologize. But if that's the case, can you give us an idea of how much that has changed over the last, say, six months in terms of buying closer to need? And did you guys expect that behavioral shift when you provided your initial outlook? Hal Lawton : Hey, Scott, so I'll reference that really just in the context of dominantly a big ticket and the fact that, historically, if you were to take out 2021, when you had the \u2013 the stimulus and you were to take out 2020 when there was a modest stimulus combined with, obviously, COVID, I think if you were to go back over like my 20-plus years history in retail and home improvement and the farm and ranch, Seth and Kurt, I think we'd all say that like things like riding lawn mowers, bigger ticket items like that, customers typically buy them when they need. The vast majority of those categories or purchases are needs based. And that's really what we were trying to signal is we're seeing more of that than we did kind of in 2020 and 2021, really more of reversion to kind of historic purchasing patterns of those sorts of categories, nothing otherwise intended to be implied. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. So just the normalization of what you have historically seen prior to pandemic-related changes? Hal Lawton : Exactly, exactly. Nothing otherwise intended to be implied. And thanks for the clarification. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Chris Horvers : Thanks and good morning. So my follow-up question on the weather and the April trend is, April was pretty historically bad last year as well. And spring really broke in May and June. So I'm assuming May and June got a lot better for you. So how are you thinking about -- you talked about 2Q being at the high end of the range for the year. How you think about the current trend versus the harder compares? Is it just April still cold and wet, so the mid-single digit is not necessarily reflective of the potential despite the harder compares? Hal Lawton : Hey, Chris, as we called out quarter-to-date, we're nearly done with April is mid-single-digit comps and low positive single-digit comp transactions. And so given the cool wet weather that's continued into April, we're relatively pleased with that performance. As a recollection from last year, June was not a strong spring selling season. The last year's spring only had a handful of really good weeks, and then it went very hot. And that's what I was referencing earlier about the drought. If you recall, on our Q2 call, we started to talk about the drought in the back half of -- kind of back half of June and into July. And then we reiterated that that we saw that impact us for the first six, eight weeks of Q3 as well. So, we are optimistic that we can have a solid May comp on top of a weaker June and have an extended selling season into July and August this year, particularly in core areas for us, like Florida, Texas, and California. California and Texas, in particular, were under extreme drought conditions by the time we got to mid-June last year and really extended into September. As we know, those areas have had extreme weather the first half -- the first quarter of this year. We're all reading about the flooding in California and such. And we think that will bode well for us as we get into the summertime in those areas of the country. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then as a follow-up on the margin line, historically, your first quarter gross margin is a decent indication of what the year looks like, but it also sounds like some things are breaking their way on the freight side and inventory is very clean. So, is there just a general bias upward over the year on the gross margin line? And could that lead to some potential operating margin upside as if sales come in line with plan? Hal Lawton : Yes. And thanks for calling that out, Chris. As Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see a variety of ways for us to achieve our guidance this year, both on the sales side and on the earnings side. And as it relates to earnings, there's a number of expense opportunities that are starting to show up, if you will, particularly in our supply chain and in the Orscheln integration cost. On the gross margin side, look, this is the benefit of being a scaled player in our market. And when you start to see kind of just a little bit of moderation in pricing, we're able to take advantage of that and drive some upside in our gross margin rate and still remain incredibly price competitive and lead the market there. Additionally, we've seen container costs come down significantly, and that's starting to flow through. And it had some impact in Q1, but it will have more impact in Q2 and Q3. Also domestic freight is starting to trend down as well. There was a couple of, I think -- recently, one of the big freight companies mentioned that we were in a freight recession or depression, and that bodes well for us in terms of being able to leverage our scale to drive down freight costs, in particular because we've got new routes to market coming online with our new DC. And obviously, with the 150 stores we have that we're building plus with Orscheln. So, we feel really good about our gross margin rate performance. Do you feel like there's continued upside as we look towards the year? And that's one of the reasons that gives us strong confidence to be able to reinforce our guidance. Chris Horvers : Thank you. Have a great finish this spring. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Simeon Gutman : Hey good morning everyone. A quick follow-up to the last question. Your Q1 gross margin, it looks like it's the highest ever. So, can we just talk about the conceptual drivers, not some of the seasonal movement, but why is it the best ever. And then the 200 basis points of weather, I think Hal called out in the prepared remarks. Is that a spread between certain markets? Was there anything in that regarding the judicious comment you made on the consumer, or is that pure weather? Kurt Barton : Simeon, this is Kurt. I'll hit both of those. Why don't I start with the second then the first. It's a quick one. The -- the variation between geographies between weeks all reinforce what Hal was just saying. To your question, if you take like the Midwest, Northeast Commonwealth states, you compare that to the rest of the geographies. You did see a disparity because those states had a very mild winter, where it's really strong for them. And then they saw no spring, they basically saw more snowfall in March than they did in January. So we did see a very clear disparity between those low or mid-single-digit negative to mid-single-digit positive in the other geographies, which, again, just gives us the confidence in the trends of the business. On the gross margin question, I'll give the primary drivers, and I'll just give you the order of magnitude on what we're seeing in gross margin. And these are all areas of structural improvements. These are things that we planned for, but as Hal said, we see continued upside in gross margin. First is our price management was the biggest driver of that. That was offset by the second, which would have been a mix impact from CUE and then the third was benefit from freight. Freight is the one that we believe continues to have potential benefit going forward. On price management, just a couple of points on there. When we talk price management, it really includes more than just managing the retail price. It's the retail pricing, it's the management of everyday low pricing, our promos, and then even the cost negotiation and concessions. And Seth the team did an excellent job leveraging our scale, our size in this environment to produce a strong enough price management direct margin to offset -- more than offset the CUE. So between retail price management and pressure from CUE, that was about half the benefit. Transportation was about the other half. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. You may proceed. Seth Sigman : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the last point. So I think you raised the accretion by $0.05 for Orscheln, which is obviously encouraging. You did keep the full year guidance and probably appropriate just given the Q1 challenges. But can you just help frame what some of the underlying changes may be in that guidance? Because it sounds like the message is that you should be able to recoup a lot of the sales from Q1, maybe not January, but the bulk of the rest and then gross margin seems to be tracking ahead. SG&A, while it was elevated, it does seem to be as planned and maybe just we were all mis-modeling it. So is there anything else that you could sort of point to within that? Hal Lawton : Yeah. Hey, good morning. And thanks, Seth, for the question. I'll speak just about Orscheln integration for a moment. First off, it's -- the integration is going very well. Most importantly, it's being well received by the Orscheln team members as they are converting to Tractor Supply team members. And it's also being really well received by customers and even more so than I anticipated. Secondly, the team is doing a fantastic job cadencing the stores and transitioning them over to Tractor Supply banners. We have several done already. We've got almost 20 that are converted from a point-of-sale transaction. We're implementing the Fusion remodel on all of them, and we are on -- we are ahead of schedule on those transitions. And then what that allows us to do is to take our back half plan and optimize a bit how the expense structure that we had planned. And so, specifically, there's two elements that are driving that. The first is our IT integration cost. Our team is doing an excellent job integrating from an IT perspective, and we're finding some leverage there and some need to not have to spend what we previously anticipated. And the second is around the sale of the SSC and the DC. We previously planned that to the end of the year. We're now optimistic that we can pull that forward by maybe a month or two or three, and we'll save some dollars there as well from an operating cost perspective. So in general, the Orscheln acquisition is going very, very well. We're very pleased with how it's progressing and wanted to share that outlook today. More broadly, what I'd say is, I think like most companies that are reporting this weekly cycle, everyone is kind of -- you seem to see a lot of people holding guidance in spite of like what you just articulated, some upside for us on gross margin rate, on expense and others just in the spirit of -- because there's a lot of the year left to go. Seth Sigman : Okay. Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. You may proceed Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry for beating a dead horse here. But with regard to weather, I just want to make sure, I'm hearing this correctly. I mean so, clearly, there was a weather disruption here in Q1. It sounds like in early Q2, you've seen sales pick up -- comp sales pick up meaningfully. But in markets across the country where there was no weather disruption, are sales there tracking consistent with how you would expect them to track? Kurt Barton : Hey, Brian, this is Kurt. Yes. On that, I'll give -- I'll just continue to give a few points. In areas where they're not as impacted by weather, you heard me mention to the previous question, the South, the Texas area, Far West, all those areas we saw performance in line with our expectations versus the areas of the North and Midwest where it was below our expectations. I'll also add in what also was so evident to us is that internally, when we look at the variation by categories in merchandising, the categories that we -- that are not impacted by weather variations right in line with expectations. When we look at the weeks within it, you can look at the first few weeks and the last three weeks, and you see which weeks are not like the others. And then when we look at our external measurements, where we've utilized market industry information on that, it also confirms that Tractor Supply outperformed the market. In farm and ranch, we've seen in market industries, it's running negative in those, especially in those areas where there is a lot of farm and ranch competition. So from all the data points that we see for -- I mean, for Q1, the -- any of the softness was seasonal and then as we look throughout the rest of this quarter, it's really a matter of when does spring start. It's not if, but when. And it's a matter of whether it's ideal, typical, poor, but Tractor Supply has been able to pivot and be able to manage each of those quarters. And to house point, it's very much shaping up like one of those years where it gives us the opportunity for a good extended selling season. Hal Lawton : And Brian, this is Hal. Just to add on to that. I mean, if you go back and look at weeks eight, nine and 10, where we were starting to comp on some tougher weather from last year, and kind of, late spring, early March was actually good weather, kind of, reasonably across the country, we had high single-digit comps those three weeks. And then as you get into the last three weeks, we had negative comps those three weeks, and it was driven by the geographies that Kurt mentioned, kind of, from the State of Virginia all the way up to the Northeast through the Midwest. And they were comping on top of tough weather from last year, and it was worse weather than they had -- than we had this year. You know, if you look at areas like Kurt said, in Florida and Texas and elsewhere, we had good seasonal spring seasonal businesses in those areas. So really, we just point to those three weeks. And then as we said, as we bounce back here in April at the mid single-digit comp rate. Brian Nagel : No, that's very, very helpful. And just one quick follow-up. So again, I'm asking you necessarily to be a meteorologist, but as you look at the dynamic here, as we've had this, what seems to be a very wet late winter, early spring, going historically, has that ever not led to an extended spring or in the spring that was actually better for Tractor Supply? Hal Lawton : We'd love to be a weather predictor and be good at it. As you know, most of the weather forecast you get are either 12 months out and then like three weeks out. But the reason we brought up 2013. 2014, by the way, was a kind of reasonably similar year pattern, where you had a similar -- in fact, we went back and pulled our earnings transcripts from those dates and looked at them. And we almost had a very similar earnings call where we talked about weather in Q1, cold, wetter, could potentially lead to an extended selling season into the summer, and that's sure enough is exactly what happened in both of those years. And that's why we brought it up to say there is very much a precedent for it. And in particular, this year we'll be comping on top of a one and 10-year drought last year. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can have an extended selling season this year, which would be on top of tougher comps -- I mean, easier comps from last year. Brian Nagel : Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Hal Lawton : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Kate McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to ask about market share. There seems to be a lot of commentary on this. And I wondered if you could remind us what assumption you're making for market share in your guide for this year? Was it something you saw an acceleration of in the first quarter? And with some of the changes you're highlighting with the new leadership and merchandising, in those categories, are you expecting more of a lift in market share than maybe originally planned, or is that more for 2024? Kurt Barton : Kate, hey, this is Kurt. Our original expectation and guidance, just to reiterate that, we see as we entered this year, GDP growing 1% to 2% was our assumption. And then Tractor Supply has historically been growing outside of that as we're grabbing market share, so another 1% or 2% of growth beyond that. And where Seth talked about -- where we're gaining market share, we are certainly gaining market share in categories like companion animal, in poultry, in other areas. And so that gain is part of what we expect to be able to do. But I'd also say, as we look at this year, where there may be any challenges in regards to the consumer, this is a great opportunity. Just like we saw where some discretionary, saw some softness, offset by a robust gain in market share. And I think that's the resiliency of the business, and that's -- one of the exciting things is that, if there is some softness in some categories, we've got opportunity in live goods, companion animal, others to gain market share. And we see upside to our market share gains compared to our standard model for this year and the next couple of years. Seth Estep : Hey, Kate, just to add a couple of points on that. Thanks for your question. This is Seth. Hey, in general, right now, if we look at our business and we think about where we're going to continue to grow market share, again, to Kurt's point, we are very excited to see market share gains, particularly like in our companion animal or our pet and our dog businesses as well as on the cat side. Our entire portfolio, if you call it like in pet food, is growing extremely strong. As Hal mentioned earlier, we're seeing our current customer base, our previous customer base really maintaining those categories in which they were purchasing, they're coming more often. And we're gaining a lot of new shoppers across the portfolio. And we think our merchandising strategy and our portfolio strategy, particularly in things like pet and pet food, is very much a strategic advantage for us to continue to gain market share. Newness and innovation is critical. Our merchants are continuing to drive comprehensive resets across the box and where they're planned. And if you also look at other items that are relative to lifestyle, whether that be like poultry, feed, forage, sporting goods, as we mentioned earlier, we are continuing to lead in those categories. So, for us, we are, by far, leading share in the industry and in farm and ranch, far away leading pet share gains. We don't anticipate that slowing down based on the activity that we're seeing and the customer response we're seeing in our database today. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. You may proceed. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A little bit focused on the merchandising management team. You're obviously beefing it up. And so I was wondering, what drove that decision? Do you see significant opportunities to expand the total addressable market? And if yes, where do you think those opportunities are? Seth Estep : Hey, Scott, yes, Seth, thanks for the question. Absolutely on those questions today. For us, kind of what we said earlier, for us, as we continue to grow rapidly over the course of the last few years, we saw an opportunity to continue to double down and drive at a greater scale, our merchandising activities, really driving towards innovation, really driving towards strategic partnerships, driving into categories, driving into regionalization, localization, so that we can really maximize all the work we're doing with like our Fusion, our Garden Centers, all those type things. So if we look at our portfolio strategy, we see share opportunities across many of the areas of our addressable market. We just mentioned pet. We see that we continue to have opportunities there. We reorganized our feed and our core livestock and equine division to species, where we're really driving a category management approach. We're basically taking the way in which we've managed our pet business over the course of the last few years and applying those same category management principles on new items, shopper insights, adjusting the flow, localization, regionalization to continue to make sure that we are offering the best-in-class shopper experience as we have new shoppers entering today. I mentioned we're going to be piloting some things like in Orscheln Farm and Home, Sporting goods did very well for us in Q1. And we're going to continue to lean in where we have our strengths. A lot of those categories today are just in our center core for six months. We think we have an opportunity to drive those businesses year-round. I can go on and on, but we think that the new structure that we're putting in place today is allowing us to have more agility, continue to move fast, operate at scale and continue to drive deeper partnerships and innovation. So very excited about this, and we're starting to really see some programs come to life under this new structure. Scott Mushkin : And do you see the data from the frequent shopper card helping you with the vendors and the relationship is getting stronger and more beneficial? Seth Estep : Absolutely. Leveraging our 30 million members in our database is such a strategic advantage for us, not only in farm and ranch, but just in broader retail in the categories in which we serve. We are continuing to deep dive into those categories, and we are partnering in a significant way with our vendor base to say, hey, where do we continue to end up where we have opportunities, what are those cohorts that we need to continue to go after? And how do we continue to drive regionalization, localization, and use that into our assortment planning process. So absolutely. It is -- Neighbor's Club is fundamental to everything we're doing not only from a marketing perspective, but it is a core driver of everything we're doing in merchandising because the customer is what we're looking to continue to drive to make sure we know where their needs are today, but where they're going in the future. Scott Mushkin : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Hal, Seth and Kurt. I wanted to revisit the side lot plus Fusion remodels in terms of cost versus sales lift as we approach the core of the spring selling season here. So two-part question. One, can you remind us of the net cost of such projects, and whether you've been able to improve the net spend behind these projects as you scale the initiative? And then, two, how has the spring selling season, albeit early, changed your expectation, right, for the overall sales lift or the ROIC that you expect to generate behind this spend as well? Hal Lawton : Yeah, hey Steven, thanks so much for the question. I'll hit three things quickly and just in the sake of time. First off, the capital spend for both the garden center projects, kind of side lot transformations and the inside-the-store Fusion transformation continues to reduce. It's a key area of focus and one of our primary metrics that we're evaluating our performance on our strategic initiatives this year. The second thing is the performance of our Fusion and Side Lot remodels are continuing to perform at the same rate as they have in the last couple of years, which we're incredibly pleased with because we're now reaching significant scale on both inside of our company. The third thing is, we are very pleased with the live goods performance. I think it's strategically going to be big for us this year. It's a low-cost way for people to beautify their yards, kind of -- and there's going to be a lot of refreshing coming out of the December and November storms that happened and we are well-positioned for that. And one of the things we always talk about is you can now see live goods sales, \u201cfrom space\u201d in our daily and weekly sales reporting, which is exactly what the plan was at the beginning of the year now with 350 garden centers. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, we have time for more question. Operator : Absolutely. The final question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. You may proceed. Peter Benedict : Hello, guys. Thanks for squeezing in. So I guess I'll ask one about inflation. Kurt, just curious, I know high single-digit retail price inflation in the first quarter. Your thoughts on 2Q and then in the back half of the year, is that changing at all? And as you hear, you've talked a lot about some costs coming down, supply chain costs coming down. I'm curious if you're at a point where you're -- you're actually seeing some, kind of, all-in product costs coming lower year-over-year in certain areas and how you're dealing with that from a pricing standpoint? Are there areas of the business where you're actually seeing, let's call it, the price deflation at a retail level year-over-year, or is that not something that's gotten to that point yet. That's my question. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes. Peter, I'll hit those. On the inflation, our outlook on the retail price inflation for the year hasn't changed much at all. A vast majority of retail price inflation, as I mentioned in Q1, was what was put in place in the second half of last year. And we're seeing a bit of a steady plateau. Maybe some categories like pet will continue to see some. So our expectation is high single-digit Q1 moving into the mid single-digit Q2 to maybe slightly lower in Q3 and then getting into low single-digit Q4. And we're not seeing significant cost deflation. So at this point, there may be some deflation in certain areas of the business. But overall, there's some disinflation that we have expected in there. The great thing is, this year, we expect to see comp transactions really being a key driver to it. And that's what we're seeing right now, as Hal mentioned. And our expectation, as the year unfolds, it really is a good balance between ticket and transactions. Lastly, I'd say what is exciting, you heard this from both Hal and I is in other parts of the business, in cost, in SG&A, we are taking advantage of our ability to use the scale where there's either excess capacity or there's cost coming down. The operating expenses have efficiencies there and you heard that in some of our messaging. So hopefully, that helps answer the question, a lot of great expectation. Our ability in any sales scenario to really have increased operating margin in 2023. Peter Benedict : No. That's helpful. Just to follow up on something you mentioned that you've brought up transactions, and it's encouraging to see them up despite the soft seasonal stuff. I know that would not have been the case several years ago with this business. I'm just curious maybe if you guys can talk a little bit about the role that Neighbor's Club might be playing in this. I mean, just how those members are shopping more frequently, if they are? How you're expanding your wallet with those members and there's a lot of marketing initiatives underway on that front. So just maybe a little bit more on the behavior of your Neighbor's Club members and how that might be something that's helping maintain the traffic during periods of seasonal weakness? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes, absolutely, Peter. Neighbor's Club has been an integral part of driving our business and enabling customer behavior, particularly on our consumables. More and more of our customers are signing up for our private label credit card. We announced last quarter that we reached for the first time $1 billion in sales on that credit card. You get a 5% discount when you use the credit card in your purchases, which drives kind of repeat behavior on food and feed in particular. As Seth talked about, we are outgrowing the feed market by 5 points repeatedly every single quarter. And we have a 20% share far and away the largest share in the market in that category. Same thing on dog food, I mean we are far and away the share leader in dog food. It doesn't matter what metric you look at, pounds, units, dollar growth and even new customer counts. Every single week, our new customer counts for dog food are going up. And those are what we can count on to drive our transactions. And I think one of the things you mentioned is the business has -- is kind of changing to some degree from kind of three, four, five years ago in terms of having the scale we have in pet food now to complement the scale we've always had in Animal Feed and that's driving positive comp transactions for us. As we said, even in March, where we had soft weather on the seasonal side, it still allowed us to have positive comp transactions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Peter. Operator, that will conclude our remarks today. Thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter call in July. I'm around all day, so please reach out if there's anything that I can do, and I look forward to speaking to you. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's Tractor Supply Company's conference call to discuss first quarter 2023 results. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the 52,000 Tractor Supply team members for their commitment to each other and our customers and for their dedication to serving life out here. Our team is executing at a high level and did a nice job nimbly adjusting in the second quarter. We're operating in a tougher environment than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, and certainly tougher than what we forecasted as we entered the year. Consumer spending continues to shift in favor of services. Shoppers that are tired of inflation are being judicious on their baskets. Consumers continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. And additionally, our business was further impacted by the abnormal seasonal trends, particularly in the month of June. Despite this environment, we still expect 2023 to be a pretty solid year. Our customer is healthy and we're gaining share outgrowing our market by 2x, and we are significantly outpacing total U.S. retail sales growth. We anticipate that we will have positive sales comps and positive comp transactions for the year, albeit in the low-single-digits range. And importantly, net sales and earnings will grow strong mid-single-digits on top of a 53rd week last year. We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our underperformance to these expectations as specific to the current environment. The team has dialed-in and understands the challenges. For the remainder of the call today, I'll speak to a few highlights of the second quarter and then share an update on our Life Out Here strategy. John Ordus will then provide greater insights on our real estate strategy and our plans to accelerate our store growth. And then Kurt will follow John and share further details on the second quarter and our full-year outlook. So let's dig in. All right. Turning into the second quarter. We grew net sales by 7.2% with comparable store sales up 2.5%, and diluted EPS was $3.83, an increase of nearly 9%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.8% and ticket growth of 0.6%. We expected and were pleased to see comp transactions turn back positive, and this trend has continued into Q3. We began the quarter with mid-single-digit comp sales growth in both April and May. As we moved through the month of June, we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our seasonal categories with the period coming in modestly positive. In my 25 years in retail, June was one of the most topsy-turvy months that I' ve seen : smoke, drought, storms, heat, it had a little bit of it all. As mentioned, our customer base is healthy. Our active customer counts are stable and growing. Importantly, our new customer trends have leveled out after a period of lapping tremendous growth in 2020 and 2021. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to break records and improve year-over-year. And customer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic. Our Neighbor's Club reached a record 31 million members in the quarter, an increase of 5 million members in the last year. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates remain at all-time highs. Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall performance and our high value members reached a record count in the quarter. A few key trends that we're seeing our customers as follows. One, customers are increasing in their usage of credit. Two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in our lower income customers. And three, customers are buying a little more often, but a little less per trip. Now, shifting from our customer to our categories. Our year-round categories were up mid-single-digits indicative of our ongoing market share gains and our demand-driven needs-based business model. Our consumable, usable, and edible categories continue to deliver strong, stable performance and drive trips to Tractor Supply. In this quarter, CUE categories had growth in the low-double-digits. In companion animal, we are gaining substantial share throughout the category. Again this quarter, we have sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week. In livestock, our Spring Chick Days event was one of the largest ever for us with the poultry category up strong double-digits. We believe we're on track to exceed last year's record of 11 million birds sold. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we are also experiencing robust growth in new customers to the category, and this is driving both trips and ticket. Our seasonal categories were flat and below expectations. The miss was primarily in June when as mentioned previously, there were a number of choppy environmental conditions across our markets that resulted in the consumer not being as engaged in the categories we expected. This softer seasonal performance in June had a material impact on our second quarter performance and was the main driver of our miss versus our expectations. Our big ticket sales were down in that high-single digits and in line with our expectations. And in fact, our performance in the quarter was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The most significant pressure in the quarter was in zero turns, generators, and recreational vehicles. On the real estate front, we opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we've seen the cadence of our new store openings return to a more normalized rate. Our Petsense by Tractor Supply business is performing well and comps in the quarter were greater than overall Tractor Supply. And the integration of Orscheln is right on track. Today, we fully transitioned and re-grand opened 15 locations. We remain very pleased with the customer's response as we convert to the Tractor Supply brand. Although, the operating environment may be different than we anticipated as we enter the year, I'm incredibly proud of how the team has come together to navigate the various circumstances and control what we can control. Now transitional an update on our Life Out Here strategy. We remain very confident in our long-term growth outlook. We participate in a large, fragmented, attractive market. We continue to benefit from numerous structural tailwinds, including rural revitalization, homesteading, self-reliance, and pet ownership. We have numerous substantive competitive advantages and are investing to expand them through our Life Out Here strategy. Since we first embarked on our strategy in the fall of 2020, the team has made remarkable progress on the transformation of Tractor Supply. As a reminder, the five pillars of our strategy include : deliver legendary customer experiences, advance our one tractor capabilities, operate the tractor way, go the country mile for our team, and generate healthy shareholder returns. And the key initiatives that support this strategy include our Project Fusion Store remodels, our Garden Center transformation, our Neighbor's Club loyalty program, and the expansion of our omni-channel capabilities. Our Project Fusion Store layout is now in over 700 stores representing greater than 30% of our store base. This program is enhancing our space productivity with improved layout, signage, skew expansions, and improved adjacencies. And for remodels, it also offers an improved customer shopping experience that is much more contemporary. Complementing Project Fusion is the side lot transformation, which is leveraging and expanding our existing outdoor side lot retail space to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a Garden Center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omni-channel technology investments. With more than 400 Garden Centers today, we've significantly expanded our assortment of lawn and garden products that are relevant to our customer's lifestyle. Importantly, these two projects are delivering on our return expectations. They're providing material sales lists. We're seeing improvement in customer satisfaction, and we're seeing higher levels of new customer acquisition in these remodeled stores. Also, our execution on the remodels continues to improve as we're in the year three now of the effort and we're reducing project costs and also continuing to shorten construction times. We re-launched our Neighbor's Club program to a points-based structure in April of 2021, and the timing was very fortuitous, as it allowed us to lock in the millions of new customers that found us through the pandemic. In total, since the re-launch, our membership has increased by 12 million members, a 60% increase. Additionally, the design of the program has facilitated upward spend migration, and driven strong retention rates. Lastly, the program provides invaluable insight into our customer behavior and allows us to personalize our offerings tailored to their needs. Look for us to evolve the structure again sometime in the next 12 months to 18 months to further enhance value for our members. Underpinning our strategy, our substantial investments in our distribution network to support the significant sales increase and store growth. Today, our network is achieving record service levels and the strongest productivity we've experienced in the last five years. Our new state-of-the-art distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, and our increased count of mixing centers now up to 15 and the implementation of engineered labor standards are all contributing to this performance. Today, I'm excited to share with you a new strategic focus area that we've been working on for a little over a year. The transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that is designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin rate, and reinforced our long-term guidance. First, we're raising our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores, and we believe we continue to have significant runway for growth with high return new stores. Second, we're implementing new capabilities to enable owned development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allowing for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post-construction. Third, we're also announcing plans to periodically execute sale leaseback transactions of our existing ownership of 117 stores, and we're going to have a step up in our ongoing build of stores back to 90 stores per year starting in 2025. Today's real estate announcement extends our runway for growth and reinforces our long-term financial model. It's a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John who can share some more color on our real estate strategy. John Ordus : Thank you, Hal. It's an exciting time for the store operations in real estate team. As we embark a new ways to capture growth and market share, while also driving efficiencies in our real estate processes. Over the last year, we've installed new leadership and talent in our real estate team. This has allowed us to reevaluate where we are in the natural progression of our store growth plans and our ability to leverage our real estate capital structure. This new approach will allow us to realize cost savings and be more nimble with our store portfolio. Our strong outlook for new store growth is direct correlation of the millions of new customers we have acquired and our overall sales performance over the last several years. This provides us with nearly a decade of new store growth in the United States. We believe these are low risk, high return, organic growth opportunities. We anticipate accelerating our new store growth from approximately 70 stores this year to 80 in 2024 and 90 new stores in 2025 and beyond. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continue strong new store productivity metrics with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis, and our stores are profitable in year one. As part of our growth plans, let's start with new stores. We have developed a new sales forecasting model to determine new stores mature sales, and pro forma results to develop our total market store growth opportunity of 3,000 stores. This was the first update to our modeling process in four years. We have infused the process with a machine learning model and insights from our 31 million Neighbor's Club members. This gives us tremendous confidence to raise our outlook by 200 stores for a total of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the U.S. To capture its growth, the real estate team is ramping up our pipeline to allow us to accelerate our store openings to 90 new stores by 2025. We are on track to open approximately 70 new stores this year with a step up to 80 new stores in 2024. We have a robust pipeline of new stores in our sites over the next 24 months. In fact, our pipeline is at the best level of development since prior to the pandemic. The team is also building new capabilities to optimize our real estate portfolio. For instance, we'll start own development of stores this year through a fixed fee developer model, and over time anticipate self-development in new stores. This year, we anticipate 20 to 30 of our new stores will be in our own development pipeline for 2024 new store openings, many of which will begin development in this year. A benefit of these new programs is our ability to have more control and visibility in this development process. The great news is that we estimate these capabilities will result at a 10% to 20% estimated rent reduction as compared to a developer model build. This rent reduction helps us continue and improve our new store returns. Part of the investment in creation of this development model requires more upfront cash. It is exciting that we are able to fund this through the sale lease back of 10 to 15 stores this year out of the 117 stores that we owned. Going forward, we find to use the sale lease back program on both existing owned stores as well as new store openings. This program will help fund our planned owned store development. It will also capture value in currently owned stores. With nearly 2,200 stores, we are also strategically investing in and optimizing our existing store portfolio as part of the lease renewal cycle. All stores will go through an in-depth review to ensure we have the right real estate strategy in place. We'll then take action to ensure that all stores have the right location, size, facility, rent structure, and format. These factors are critical to the success of our team and stores to deliver legendary customer service. With that, let me now pass it over to Kurt for our financial review. Kurt Barton : Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. Turning to our second quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, I commend the team on how they have remained nimble and steadfast in our commitment to be the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. In many ways, our second quarter top-line results were very consistent with our results in the first quarter with strong CUE growth, flattish, seasonal performance, and a decline in big ticket sales. Our comparable store sales growth was the strongest in the Far West, South Atlantic and Texas, Oklahoma. The strength of these regions was offset by pressure in the Northeast and Midwest regions were seasonal trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand. Comp sales in the quarter benefited by about 5 percentage points from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price increases that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not laughed as of yet. Much like the first quarter, the benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by the impact of three factors. First, the average ticket was impacted by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Second, we also experienced softer sales in discretionary and impulse add-on items. Third, on a positive note, we also saw our customers shopping us more frequently with a slight reduction in the number of items per basket. Overall, our customers are buying more units or pounds from us in total. Moving down our income statement. Our gross profit increased 9.3% to $1.51 billion. Gross margin increased 69 basis points to 36.2% from 35.5% in the prior year's second quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate. As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses including depreciation amortization increased 77 basis points to 22.8%. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. The growth in medical claims is due to new benefit offerings that had stronger engagement rates than we anticipated, as well as higher program costs overall. We have made some adjustments to the program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024. Approximately 80% of our SG&A growth year-over-year represents investments for growth such as new stores, the impact of Orscheln Farm and Home, the new DC, and the depreciation from our capital investments for items such as Project Fusion remodels and Garden Center transformations. The core SG&A costs leveraged well, even in a low comp sales environment. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core costs to our sales performance. For the quarter operating profit margin was 13.4%, an 8 basis points declined from the prior year. Consistent with our guidance from the year, Orscheln stores had a modest drag on operating income, principally due to factors unique to the transition. In Q2, we attribute approximately 10 basis points of operating margin decline to activities relating to Orscheln. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a decrease of 1.7% in average inventory per store. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory as we enter the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we strategically issued $750 million in long-term debt, which brings our weighted average fixed rate to 3.4%. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to building on our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our real estate portfolio management is another way that we can continue to facilitate strong returns. Let me shift now to share a few financial highlights as a result of the evolution of our real estate strategy. The sale lease back of 10 to 15 owned stores is anticipated to close during the second half of the year, resulting in a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share. We are under contract on 10 stores and expect to close on those stores in the third quarter. The expected net gain reflects a selective reinvestment of a small portion of the benefit from the sale back into our store infrastructure this year. For modeling purposes, the net gains will be recorded in operating income as an offset to SG&A. Given the migration to our new real estate development strategy, we anticipate that we have about a decade of runway from the sale of existing company-owned stores ahead of us. This increases cash flow over the coming years and is a great way for us to leverage the strength of our balance sheet. The more efficient owned development program is expected to drive lower new store rent. As the program ramps, these savings are anticipated to more than offset the incremental rent expense from the sale leaseback of existing stores. In 2025 and beyond, the acceleration of our new store growth to about 90 stores annually should help us capture market share and bolster the high end of our long-term guidance ranges. We continue to have very robust new store economics providing us the confidence to make this shift. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. At the halfway point of the year, we are now forecasting low-single-digit comp sales and mid to high-single-digit earnings growth. We continue to believe this will be a year of solid performance for us as we continue to gain market share and advance our strategic initiatives. We are carefully watching many leading macroeconomic indicators, consumer behavior and retail trends, as well as our own insights to assess the health of the consumer. While our customers remained healthy, we are more cautious about their discretionary spending in the second half of the year. At the same time, we are moderating our expectations for the performance of our seasonal categories based on our trends in the first half of the year that have been choppy and below our expectations. We believe it is prudent to recalibrate our expectations for both the discretionary and seasonal categories based on our year-to-date trends. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, comp store sales growth of 1.3% to 2.5% growth. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.3% with net income of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10.20 to $10.40. This includes a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share for the sale leaseback. We anticipate about $0.15 will be recognized in Q3 and $0.05 in Q4. In the light of the updates to our real estate strategy, anticipated capital expenditures for the year are now forecasted to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million compared to our prior range of $700 million to $775 million. This increase reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It is important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our owned stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarters, we continue to believe that comp sales will be stronger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Both quarters are modeled to achieve comp sales growth. Please keep in mind that we are laughing a monumental winter storm in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we estimate contributed 200 basis points to comp sales in the quarter. As for retail price increases, our plans continue to reflect a moderation from the impact of inflation. At the same time, we would anticipate a pickup in our comp transaction growth as we experienced this quarter. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and the new distribution center, along with some pressure from unfavorable product mix. For the third quarter, our SG&A performance exclusive of the sale leaseback is anticipated to be in line with the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a modest deleverage given the comparisons from the prior year. For modeling purposes the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024 based on when the store is converted to our point of sale system. We will share more details when we provide our 2024 outlook. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy. For Tractor Supply, we expect to end the year in a strong position for the future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap us up. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Stepping back, Tractor Supply has achieved remarkable growth over the past few years and the team has done an excellent job scaling our processes, capabilities, and organization to manage this growth. Key operational areas like inventory and payroll grew materially but at a lesser rate than sales and were always in control. Key philosophies like EDLP were re-embraced and our marketing media mix shifted fully away from print to digital. And the combination of these two enabled our promotional activity to achieve all-time lows and we remain there. In addition to these efforts, we launched our Life Out Here strategy to continue the ongoing transformation of our business. This strategy helped lock-in new customers, substantiate our market share gains, and is a platform for our future growth. The timing could not have been better. At the halfway mark of 2023, it is shaping up to be a solid year for Tractor Supply on top of three extraordinary years. Our market is stable and our customers remain healthy. The team is effectively controlling what we control. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary, Tractor Supply remains a unique highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through various economic conditions. As a company, we have a proven ability to manage through dynamic environments whether that is a macroeconomic or seasonal weather trends. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here lifestyle and they prioritize it. Our customers over indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners, and animal owners. As a market leader, we have substantial advantages that are getting stronger every day. Additionally, investment in our Life Out Here strategy has critical mass. The natural evolution of our real estate strategy is furthering our competitive advantages. We see meaningful growth potential in our markets. I remain extremely confident that we have a tremendous runway growth ahead of us, and with the right team and the right strategy, we're continuing to build a strong foundation for the future. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I'm going to just kind of roll two into one, if that's okay. So the first question and tied into the second was that I think you always had the assumption that your kind of comp would be 1% to 2% above GDP and that relationship doesn't seem to be holding right now. So I just want to talk about that. And then excluding the benefit of the sale leaseback, you had also kind of indicated 2023 would be the peak investment period for you, and then we should start see to see operating margin expansion in 2024. Is this still your thinking? And I guess I'm again excluding the sale leaseback development and then benefit. Thanks very much. Hal Lawton : Hey, Karen, good morning, and thanks for joining the call. On your first part of the question, a bit to my comments earlier, we see this period of time as a bit of an aberration versus our kind of ongoing growth algorithm. As you see in GDP and you see where PCE is going. And then you see the shift from goods to services right now. As you services historically been 68%, 69% of spend cons -- goods kind of 31%, 32%. As you know, goods kind of shifted up to say 35%, 36% during the pandemic. We're kind of halfway back on that March back to 31%. So that as we said in our prepared remarks is a bit of a headwind in our business, but certainly expect that we've got maybe halfway to go on that and then it would level back out in its normal equilibrium and would expect that our growth algorithm would return to that 1% or 2% above GDP growth in the guidance we've given historically, again, we just view this period of time as a bit of an aberration from that long-term algorithm just given the macro dynamics. And then the second thing is, yes, no, no change to the guidance so to speak that we've given on the out year certainly expect 2023 to still be our peak investment year. As you mentioned, the sale leaseback is really just a $0.20 plus or minus that'll be in every single one of our years going forward as an add or two our EPS. But expect that we'll be at our peak investment period this year and that will start to moderate down next year with an opportunity for margin expansion accordingly. Operator : Thank you, Karen. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So I have a question on the real estate changes as well. I mean, it makes sense that you guys can improve your cost structure as you take ownership of the build, but if you would expect your stores to remain productive over a long stretch of time. Is this a better model to actually own the stores outright rather than lease in the first place? How obviously you have some history with that at one of your prior shops. Or does this real estate shift suggest that may -- we may see changes to the existing footprint, whether it's changing locations kind of relocation type scenario or different sizes, et cetera. Thanks. Kurt Barton : Hey Scot, this is Kurt. Good morning. And the real estate model as you think about the opportunity that we have to drive a strong performance of new stores that we've seen since there's a structural shift in the tailwinds into the rural economy, into our markets, the new stores are performing well. We -- as John mentioned, we built a real estate team that is ready to begin to ramp back up to a 90-ish new store. The sale leaseback of existing stores fits right in with that. We're an asset light model. Do not believe owning stores fits, which is why we have over 95% of our stores under a lease. And over time, 30 plus years, we've accumulated not strategically a number of owned stores. There's a bit of pent-up value in these stores, and it's a great time right now to use those stores to fuel and be able to keep a cash neutral value to execute on a strategy that allows us to even further drive new stores, bring efficiency in the new store model. So I look at those, we look at those very much tied in between as a great way to fund a model that drives greater long runway, greater TSR in the overall long-term algorithm. And I really keep both of those very much tied together as part of a key part of our operations. Operator : Thank you, Scot. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So you deemed a 2.5 comp in the second quarter with 500 basis points of like-for-like price inflation. You probably got some demand that was shifted out of 1Q into 2Q. And your guidance implies you're going to do call it a 1 to 2 comp for the back half of the year, even as you lap some of the big price increases from last year. So can you give us a sense for what is going to accelerate or improve in the business to offset the mitigating contribution from inflation? And have you already started to see that quoted again? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hey Michael, good morning. Couple things. First off, I wouldn't -- I don't think it's a fair comment to say we had sales from Q1 shift into Q2. I just think given the weather and the seasonality that we had this year, we don't have any data or insights or customer purchase data that would suggest that there is any pull or kind of deferral into Q2 or weather-related kind of shifting into Q2. So I'd say that's not a something that we have to offset as you think about from a sequential perspective. The second thing I'd say is we have seen comp transactions sequentially improve throughout the quarter and continuing into Q3 and expect that that will be the case throughout the year. And on AUR as we've talked about all along, we expect that that will moderate through the year, big ticket lessens as a percent as we get through the year. So that provides a bit of a kind of mix and benefit. And then, lastly, on the UPT, we do think we're at close to the bottom of units per transaction. If you go back and look over the last 15 years at our units per transaction trends, we reached an all-time high during the pandemic as people were stocking up and consolidating their trips. We're now much closer to the -- where we were during the 2008 Great Recession and kind of reached that, that, that bottom. And so we expect that will be a lesser headwind as we move forward. So when you put those things all together that ends up with the guidance that we shared. And I think we try to be as conservative as possible on the low end and realistic as possible on the high end. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open. Chuck Grom : Hey thanks. Good morning. Hal, there's some concern out there that has households continued to revert back to pre-COVID behaviors that some of the gains that Tractor's enjoyed over the past three years when sales per store has moved from call it $4 million to $6 million will be given back. I'm curious how you'd address this concern and can you highlight the key drivers that a Tractor can control in the back half and into 2024? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Chuck, and good morning, and thanks for joining the call. As I think we all know in this call, this has been a question for 18, 24 months. And what I'd say is we continue to see a very healthy customer base. Our active customers were at all-time highs this quarter. We saw positive comp transactions in the quarter. And if you look at the categories that are driving the footsteps and driving our customers, it's things like pet, animal, and those are based on counts of population out there in each of those categories. And so -- and then the last thing I'd point out is our share gain. At least half of the volume that we've cap -- that we've grown over the last handful of years has been share related. And so if I point to share active customers, comp transactions, pet, animal and look at those things, it's just a very different business than many of the other companies that kind of had a pandemic benefit reverted whether it was technology-related companies that had a user base that shifted online and then pivoted back or maybe something that's home related, electronics related. We're just a very different business and don't see any elements of reversion in our customer base or business. Operator : Thank you, Chuck. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is now open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Hal, I wanted to follow-up on who that new customer is. How is the retention trending? I think you mentioned they're younger, so I'm curious, is there a difference in spending power between this most recent vintage of new customers and the historical ones? And are we seeing any change in the neighborhood -- Neighbor's Club adoption? I would think the push towards value makes the loyalty program more valuable, but can you provide any commentary or quantification around how that's trending differently? Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Daniel, and good morning. Start out by first thing, we're very pleased with the trends we're seeing in new customers. We had record high new customers in 2020 and 2021. As we've talked about on past calls, our Neighbor -- and I mentioned our prepared remarks, the Neighbor's Club program being re-launched in April of 2021 was incredibly well timed as it allowed us to lock those new customers in. We've grown I think it's 15 million members over the last three years in our Neighbor's Club program. And we've had increased retention rates of our Neighbor's Club program each of the last few years too. So we've lost those cohorts in, they're growing with us and they're remaining active. Certainly as we got into 2022 and things balance some, we saw our new customer counts on a year over basis trend down it is that is now leveled out. And we feel really good about our new customer trends as we move forward and sequentially that should be helpful as we look at year-over-year improvements. On the Neighbor's Club program continue to be very pleased with the 31, 32 million members of Neighbor's Club that we have, our top tiers are -- has grown and we reached a record number of customers in our top tier. Retention rates remain at all-time highs and continue to improve. And our Neighbor's Club members continue to out comp our overall base. And again, that's on 75% of our sales. So as I've said several times, our customer base is very healthy, record active customers, positive comp transactions, solid trends and new customers, and feel really good as we're heading into the third quarter on our active customer base and our strength of our customer. Operator : Thank you, Daniel. Our next question goes to the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Hey, good morning, everyone. So my question is around the second half guidance, the implied margins, it does seem like you're baking in potentially more margin improvement in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, despite potentially lower comps. And I know some of that now is the sale leaseback. But I guess two questions. One, can you just remind us and maybe help bridge some of the drivers for the second half margin expansion. And then second, how do you think about potentially reinvesting more of that margin improvement given the sales performance that you're seeing? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Hey Seth, this is Kurt. I'll take the first part of that question and I'll let Seth answer the second part in regards to the reinvestment of any margin. The performance on an operating margin standpoint for the second half on a gross margin standpoint will be very similar to second quarter. We continue to see, and as we signaled and guided at the beginning of the year, we have strong performance from everyday low pricing. We expect to continue to see transportation being the biggest benefit in fueling of the gross margin expansion. As a reminder, over the two years where transportation costs were pressured, we absorbed most of that and this is anticipating somewhat transitory. We're getting the return on that in 2023. On an SG&A standpoint, what really -- that's really the big difference in say the second half as you're observing, we expect Q3 on an SG&A standpoint, excluding the sale leaseback benefit to perform very similar to Q2 in that 70, 80 basis points deleverage principally from the investments in the business, but Q4 really has the best compares. And so in line with what we expect to go into the year when you look back at the fourth quarter of last year where while we had robust sales, we had increased cost in repairs from the storm, we had Orscheln acquisition transition, we had higher incentive compensation. We are lapping that and we expect in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit from any sale leaseback to really still only have a modest level of SG&A deleverage principally on the compares. So if you hold the gross margin, you get better performance on SG&A. It's really about how well we're managing to spend. And I also can't ignore that the team has done an excellent job scaling the cost, leveraging investments we made, we are seeing significant efficiencies, even SG&A on the distribution and supply chain side of the business driving lower cost and some efficiencies beyond our expectations. With that, Seth, I'll -- maybe you can address the second part of that question. Seth Estep : Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Yes. In relation to should we reinvest and how we think about that? First, I would just say EDLP remains our true north, and that strategy continues to pay off for us. If you look at the success we're having with our accumulated activity, our transactions, and our continued record kind of customer counts that are coming to Tractor Supply, and our plan is to continue to maintain that EDLP focus and not to revert from that. We will reinvest if we decide we need to, but we do not foresee a need for any meaningful type of reinvestment. And lastly, I would just kind of say is that, our inventory position continues to be very strong and very favorable. And as we look ahead to the back half, instead of kind of a reinvestment of margin, we've put ourselves in a position to really partner with our key suppliers to go out there, get special buys, go after key values, and make sure we have meaningful values for our customers to drive the full basket. So I'm very pleased. I think we have an incredible team. We got a great reset activity coming forward that we can manage the top-line or we can drive the top-line and drive market share while at the same time really be able to manage the margin structure as well. Operator : Thank you, Seth. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Peter Benedict : Hey, good morning, guys. So I want to maybe Hal speak a little bit more about the historical context here. I mean, you started to mention some things in answering Mike Lasser's question, but obviously we're coming off of an unusual period with COVID. You're starting to see this normalization occur. Your -- the behavior of your consumers changing. Maybe just talk a little bit more about what that means to the credit, the basket trends and then kind of what we think that kind of is indicating here over the next kind of 6 months to 12 months. I know you're assuming this will continue in the back half of this year, but how are you just thinking about it longer-term? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey Peter, and good morning. If you look back over 30 years of this company's comp growth, it's been almost equally split 50 :50 between average ticket and comp transactions. And if you look really at our body of work over the last 3.5 years during the pandemic, there's definitely been periods of time of inflation, periods of time of UPT increases. But when you look at it collectively, it's about 50 :50 comp transactions and average ticket. And that's just the formula that has really just kind of always been there in our historical numbers. And our expectation as that we -- as we navigate the current economy that we're operating in and consumer behaviors that we will migrate back to that historical blend as we kind of exit this year and move into next year. And there's going to be some ins and out, as we said in the second half of this year where we expect UPT, the headwind there to kind of level out as we get towards the end of the years. And we expect AUR to kind of come down. Those will work a little bit in together, big ticket becomes a lesser portion of sales. And so we get that mixed benefit there. And that all works out to an okay average ticket. We're seeing comp transactions increase that kind of balances a little bit right now and ends up delivering on the kind of implied guidance that we have for the second half of the year. And on the comp transactions, as I said, we had all-time record active customers this quarter. Our active customer base grew this past quarter. Their shopping is more frequently. We're seeing them do a little bit of deconsolidation of their trips as Kurt mentioned. But we're also gaining significant share in footsteps. And in categories like pet food where we continue to take substantial share, we're really viewed as kind of a value play, almost a warehouse like model. I mean, our average pet food bag size is 35 pounds, and that's very different than say, pet specialty and others. And if you look at a price per pound basis, I mean, we can be as good as 20%, 25%, 30%, advantage on a price per pound basis. And so we're just that naturally drives footsteps in our store. So the mix will evolve a little bit throughout the balance of this year, but we've certainly bought it all through and expect that over time it'll revert back to its historical performance of kind of a 50 :50 blend. Mary Winn Pilkington : Megan we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Absolutely. Thank you, Peter. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Peter Keith : Hi everyone, hope everyone's good. Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up on the new real estate strategy and just putting in the context of your long-term algorithm. Is it meaningful enough that perhaps some of those targets on an annualized basis could be adjusted? I'm guessing I'm looking specifically at the sales growth target of 6% to 7% and then the EPS growth target of 8% to 11%. Kurt Barton : Hey Peter, this is Kurt. The new real estate model, one of the many things that we're excited about is not only does it give us the long runway, but to your point, move from 70 to 90 stores a year. It's driving incremental sales. Those new stores have the -- expected to have the consistent tailwind into the comps. We believe this new real estate strategy not only gives us a longer runway, but really strengthens the long-term algorithm, gives us more confidence in that and bolsters the higher end of that. Mid-year through the year, we typically don't and aren't adjusting our long-term guidance we certainly will factor all of that in along with the outlook for 2024 as we report on our Q4 earnings, typically refreshing any adjustments to our long-term targets at this point. But we're excited about what it does for the long-term algorithm and the overall total shareholder return. Operator : Thank you, Peter. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So the question I have maybe just dig a little bit deeper into the comps around the trends seasonal sales. So the -- what I would ask there is, you talked a lot about the weakness here. It falls similar to what we saw in Q1, but any geographic differences that, that you noticed? And then as we move down to Q3, recognizing you have trim guidance from a year, but did you see any type of rebound in seasonal sales as maybe some of these weather, some of them not all, some of these weather events have started to abate. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hey, Brian, and good morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the seasonal business was kind of on expectations in the months of April and May. We had talked about that in our earnings calls for Q1 and given kind of a quarter-to-date perspective on that. And also just our commentary through the quarter publicly. And then June, as I mentioned, we saw significant underperformance in our seasonal business. And it -- that was really the bulk of our myth for the entire quarter was our seasonal business in the month of June. As I mentioned, it was a topsy-turvy quarter particularly in the month of June with all the various environmental conditions that were out there. But to your point, we did see bright spots at moments in time throughout the quarter as well as certain parts of the geography. As an example, the kind of 10 days leading up to Memorial Day were very good from a seasonal perspective and a total business perspective as the sun shine was kind of out almost across the entirety of the country. And we had a really good 10-day run there. Historically you see something like that for at least a few weeks of the spring, we just only had that kind of short period. But if you look in the Southeast, in the South Atlantic, as Kurt called out, we had excellent performance there. From time to time in the both Texas home and the Far West, when we had good seasonal performance, we had strong -- I mean, we had good weather, we had seasonal performance there. And then as Kurt called out some of our underperforming regions around the Midwest and the Northeast, I mean, the Midwest went straight from winter to drought. And in the month of June, it rained 21 days in the Northeast. And so those were dominant, those were large contributors to the underperformance in the month of June. So anyway, that's just a little bit of more depth and commentary there, Brian. Operator : Thank you, Brian. Our next question will come from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning. Hal, you had hinted at another iteration of the Neighbor's Club program at some point in 2024. So first of all, can you talk about the lift, the comp lift you saw the last time you updated the program? And is there any info you can share on the types of changes that are on the table that you think could make the program better? Hal Lawton : Hey, Zach, and good morning, and very perceptive. First off, I'd say on the comp, it's hard to calculate that both given the magnitude of the comps that we had in that period. But what I would -- given the magnitude of the comp, but what I would say is we can absolutely look at the 15 million Neighbor's Club members that we've added over the last few years and when they started to shop with us and how we locked them in using the Neighbor's Club program. And I've spoken to that many times. But we feel great about the cohorts from that first revision of our Neighbor's Club program. As we look ahead, there's a lot of -- we've been getting a lot of feedback from our customers and we can make it even better in the next -- in the next version. Doing some things to uniquely call out certain characteristics of customers if they're say a horse owner or say a military veteran, what can we do to better tailor that when they self-identify? There's also some things we can do on our rewards and maybe bite sizing the rewards up to giving some $5 rewards instead of always $10 rewards. We're also looking at a way to add, say, a fourth perhaps even the fifth tier. We -- as we mentioned, we've got our largest number of highest value customers ever. How do we actually take it up another tier and even give further rewards for those that are in that tier. So looking at a lot of ways to again it's -- that program locks our customers in. It encourages spin and encourage migration. It really encourages purchasing on big ticket and then redemption on the queue businesses. We're just looking for ways to reinforce that more and also make it more personable for our customers. And the team's hard to work on it, and we have more detail on it. We look forward to sharing it. Mary Winn Pilkington : Megan, we'll take one more question as we're at the top of the hour. Take one more. Operator : Absolutely. Our final question will go to the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Steven Zaccone : Great. Good morning. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. So I wanted to just go back to the sales guidance change just to better understand how much of the change in sales guidance is really due to seasonal missing expectations versus the discretionary being a bit weaker. In the -- in one sense, the first half was really choppy with weather throughout the year, as you've discussed. So that'd be helpful. And then when you think about getting back to mid-single-digit comps, which is the original guidance, what's the biggest kind of drivers to get you back to that trend in the business? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Hey, Steven, this is Kurt. Appreciate the question. The -- as we talked about when Brian asked the question on Q2, I'll go back to the fact that a bit of Q2's performance, you have to acknowledge that as we saw some differentiation between some of the geographies that indicates weather was a contributor, but even in some of the strong geographies and across all that we saw a pullback on some of the discretionary. We are going into the second half acknowledging that, that it's a different seasonal period of time, particularly in the Q4. We plan for base weather. We do not plan for more favorable weather. And at this point on the seasonal categories, unless, we look at it as base and unless there's a strong demand for our product because of a shift in weather seasonal, the consumer on some of the discretionary items is a little bit more prudent on that today. And then also we acknowledge, as I mentioned, some of the impulse in discretionary category. So we anticipate that the consumer behavior is in line with the first half of the year. We're taking a reasonable prudent approach there. And then we're also factoring in the strong winter storm that we had in the fourth quarter that we're lapping up against. But underpinning all of that is a strength in our year-round core business running in the mid-single-digits. Comp transactions still performing strong at this point, and we've got a really good healthy customer. Hal mentioned some of the shifts that we've seen, UPT coming off some of its highs as you revert back to the mid-single-digits, it's really a matter of UPT and the consumer coming off of the cycle as we've seen in the last couple quarters and really having more strength in the size of their basket and the demand for the discretionary. And we could be a couple quarters away from that. And we factor that into our guidance. Our guidance is reasonable. We're not factoring in a favorable shift in the consumer or a strong shift in favorable weather. It's taken all those factors that we've seen year-to-date as well as some of the headwinds in the second half. Operator : Thank you, Steven. That will conclude our question-and-answer session. So at this time, I'll pass the conference back over to Mary Winn for closing remarks. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Megan. This will conclude our call. I am available for any questions or follow-up. So please feel free to reach out and we look forward to speaking to you at our Q3 earnings call in October. So thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful day.",

I appreciate your cooperation. We will be available after the call for follow-up.  Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks Mary Winn and thank you to everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. To start, I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. As always they lived our mission and values, delivered legendary service to our customers, did a great job being nimble in the quarter, and continued to deliver against our strategic initiatives.  At Tractor Supply the underlying health of our business remains strong. We continue to achieve substantial market share gains. Our customer trends and customer engagement are robust and our Life Out Here strategic initiatives remain on track.  Entering the third quarter, we had a sharp focus on the impact of the evolving macro environment and the impact of that environment on our customers retail spending patterns. Despite this view, our quarter was more challenging than we initially expected. The primary drivers of our under performance were less than ideal weather conditions, as well as our customers continuing to be discerning with their spending.  On the weather impact for the quarter, as we shared in our July earnings call, we anticipated that our compares would ease through the quarter as we were lapping one of the worst droughts in a decade. We were not assuming a significant benefit from the weather, but rather that it would not continue to be a drag on our performance.  In fact, it was a drag. We estimate that the unfavorable weather conditions in the third quarter contributed more than one point of comp to our sales shortfall compared to our expectations. While we never like to call out the adverse impacts of the weather on our business, there is no doubt that the challenging conditions continued to weigh on our sales this year as it relates to weather.  In Q3 we had extreme heat and drought in Texa-homa and to a lesser degree the Midwest, and also we had excessive rainfall and the absence of cool weather in other areas like the Northeast. As an example, Texa-homa which makes up a little over 15% of our sales, we saw extreme temperatures and dryness there for most of the quarter.  In fact, in Austin, Texas, as an example, there were 44 consecutive days of temperatures over 100 degrees in the third quarter. And for perspective, this was twice as many as Q3 of last year. Additionally, last year in the third quarter, we benefited from both the emergency response from Hurricane Ian and a shift to cooler fall temperatures in the last few weeks of the quarter in some of our markets.  This year, we did not have these events working in our favor. In the quarter, the emergency response from Hurricane Idalia was much smaller than the prior year. And a wave of summer-like temperatures continued into September, and in fact, even now into late October. Turning to the macro environment. As we shared last quarter, we believe that due to the cumulative effects of many factors, our customers are showing signs of strain. Examples of these factors include inflation, higher credit card balances, and the resumption of school loan payments.  Additionally, consumers continue to shift their spending from goods to services, reverting back to pre-pandemic levels. In the context of this shift though, we believe that they remain more committed to the out-here lifestyle, and that our business is stickier than more discretionary components of retail. But nonetheless, to some degree, we've been affected by this shift.  Now, turning to the numbers for the third quarter. The team delivered net sales growth of 4.3%, with a modest comparable sales decrease of 0.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.33, an increase of 11% over the prior year.  Now, let's shift to some highlights for the quarter. Comp transactions were flat for the prior year, offset by an average ticket decline of 0.3%. The average ticket performance was driven by a decline in units per transaction, with average unit retail remaining relatively strong.  July was our best performing period of the quarter with positive comps. Both August and September comps negated given the seasonal trends I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our active customer counts are stable and growing, low single digits. Also importantly, our reactivated, as well as new customer counts are also both positive and growing.  E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits, with strong conversion performance. Our Buy Online, Deliver from Store Program was up over 80%. And on a rolling 12-month basis, very notably, our digital sales have now surpassed $1 billion.  Our consumable, usable, and edible products represented a meaningful portion of our business in the quarter. And these businesses continue to outperform our overall sales comp results, with continued strength in categories like dry dog food, cat food, poultry feed, lubricants, and shavings, just to name a few.  CUE continues to be one of our structural advantages, and these categories and products represent the strength of our core business, and they are what drive footsteps into our store. The gains in these categories were offset by declines in our late spring-summer seasonal product and big ticket categories, as well as softness in demand for those fall-winter product categories that usually begin to see some growth at the end of the quarter, due to the unseasonally warm weather.  Big ticket performance remained under pressure, down in the mid-single digits, which was a slight improvement from the first half of the year. If I step back, overall though, we continue to gain share across categories online and in-store, and continue, as I said earlier, to see strong customer trends. On the customer front, our Neighbor's Club membership base represented more than 77% of our sales for the quarter. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates have never been higher, and our Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall sales performance. And importantly, our high value customers again reached another record count in the quarter.  In just over a year since launching Neighbor\u2019s Club at Petsense, penetration of sales to our members now stands at over 65%, and we continue to benefit from the cross-shopping between the two brands, as we grow our share of wallets with these customers and focus on Pets Out Here in our collaboration between the two brands. A couple of trends that I mentioned last quarter did continue into this quarter, and those are, one, customers are continually increasing their usage of credit; and two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in lower income customer cohorts.  Importantly, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit another new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team, and they continue to do a fantastic job providing best-in-class customer service, a hallmark of Tractor Supply. Through the third quarter, our customer satisfaction scores have increased and we experienced an improvement every week, year-over-year, since 2021.  We've made significant progress in our Life Out Here Strategy. We now have just over 35% of our chain or 780 stores that are in the Project Fusion Layout, and our Garden Centers transformation is now active in over 420 locations. We continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial returns of these store-level investments.  Our Orscheln Farm and Home in the acquisition remains on track, with nearly 50 stores converted to the Tractor Supply brand. And during the quarter, we completed the sale of the Orscheln Store Support Center and the Distribution Center as planned.  Year-to-date we've opened 51 new Tractor Supply stores in 10 Petsense locations. Our team has done an excellent job executing our real estate project this year, and getting us back to a normalized cadence of new store openings, in spite of a tough backdrop in the broader construction market. During the quarter the real-estate team also successfully executed our first sale lease-back transaction, with the sale of 10 stores. In addition, the team has about 35 fee development sites in the works. I anticipate our real estate strategy will continue to be a source of increasing strength for Tractor Supply over the next few years.  Given our performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our sales and earnings guidance for 2023. And Kurt will share some more details on our outlook later in the call. Before I hand it over to Kurt, if I just step back for a moment, if you told me in January of 2020 that we would nearly double our top line sales and earnings and deliver strong cash return to shareholders, while increasing our capital investment and growth initiative, and investing in team member wages, and investing in brand building, and doing all this through a global pandemic, major disruptions in global supply chains, rapidly changing consumer shifts, also rapidly escalating costs, including the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, it would have been hard to imagine, but that's exactly what this team has delivered.  Over the last four years, we've added $7 billion in incremental sales. We've grown our market share significantly, and we've increased our earnings by 115% and returned over $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders.  Our resilient needs-based business model has a proven history of growing through various economic conditions. Our customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners.  We believe that the softness we're seeing is unique to transitory conditions in weather and consumer spending patterns. We continue to have a long-term structural macro trend that are favorable and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial competitive advantages.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. There are three key observations about our business that build on Hal's comments that I'd like to share before diving into the quarterly results.  First, looking at the impact of weather. There are some years weather works to our favor and others where it clearly works against us. We've certainly tried to be transparent over the years as to the impact from the volatility related to weather, both in favorable and unfavorable events. No doubt 2023 will be a year where weather goes down as unfavorable for our business.  From a warm January, a late start to the spring that never materialized over most of our markets, to a hot and dry summer across major markets like Texa-Homa and the Midwest, our seasonal businesses have been under pressure all year.  Second, our execution continues to be strong. Our Life Out Here initiatives are performing well and are positively impacting our results. Neighbor\u2019s Club, Project Fusion and Garden Centers, pet and digital initiatives are all driving top line growth. Third, we view the softness in our customers' retail spending to be unique to the macro challenges in the current environment. Our customer engagement is strong and our initiatives are driving positive results. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth, but we will be agile as we navigate the current environment. We are committed to continuing our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders.  Now, turning to our third quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, the team managed the environment well, controlling what we can control. We also remain steadfast in our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here.  Our third quarter top-line results were driven by strong and consistent CUE growth, offset by below trend seasonal performance and a weak summer demand and a lack of early fall seasonal sales, and discretionary big ticket sales remained under pressure.  Our comparable store sales growth was solid in regions such as the southeast and the far west. The performance of these geo regions was offset by pressure in Texa-homa and the Midwest, where heat and drought trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand, as well as the warm start to the fall in the northern markets. Comparable transactions were flat for the quarter, with growth in our core year-round categories being offset by reduced demand for our seasonal categories. We had a modest decline in the average comp ticket. Our average unit retail was up 3% to 4%. The benefit of the growth in our average unit retail was offset by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, we continue to experience softer sales and discretionary and impulse add-on items, putting pressure on the average units per transaction. Moving down our income statement, our gross profit increased 7.3% to $1.25 billion. Gross margin increased 101 basis points to 36.7% from 35.6% in the prior year's third quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of everyday low price strategy.  At a time when the overall promotional environment across retail has picked up modestly, our large and robust membership of Neighbors Club offers us a great way to provide value. Our loyalty program allows us, together with our vendors, to strategically target value propositions for our customers. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs, driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate.  As a percent of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 38 basis points to 26.7%. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales. Additionally, consistent with last quarter, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. We have made adjustments to our benefits program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024.  During the quarter we completed the planned sale lease back of 10 Tractor Supply store locations, benefiting SG&A by approximately 70 basis points, net of transaction and repair costs. Additionally, the increase in SG&A was partially offset by a one-time benefit to depreciation expense of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million pre-tax. This benefit is attributed to a change in the useful lives of assets for certain remodeled stores, due to a reassessment of lease terms to better represent the economic profile of these investments.  As I reflect on the SG&A performance overall, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that our operations team did a great job scaling our core variable costs to our sales performance. Our distribution center teams achieved some of the best cut times, fill rates and overall productivity measures in years. And our store teams did a great job balancing store payroll to scale back, while also maintaining the right level of customer support and driving our best-in-class customer satisfaction scores. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core variable costs well in this environment. As an example, to further illustrate, nearly 85% of our core SG&A dollar growth year-over-year represents investments in our strategic growth initiatives. My appreciation goes out to the team for controlling what we could control. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 10%, a 62 basis point improvement from the prior year.  Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat to the prior year on a per store basis. We are managing it closely and continue to be very pleased with the quality and position of our inventory. Our in-stock rates are the best they've been in over two years. In addition, our inventory shrink improved year-over-year.  With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. Our long-term debt has no nearing maturities and it's fixed at very attractive rates. Now, let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.6 billion and comp store sales even with last year. Our full year operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.2%, with net income of $1.1 billion to $1.11 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.10. This includes a net after tax benefit of about $0.08 in Q4 for our remaining sale leaseback transactions this year. We continue to forecast anticipated capital expenditures for the year in the range of $800 million to $850 million or about $725 million to $775 million net of our capital needs for the fixed fee real estate strategy that we shared last quarter. This higher level reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It's important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our own stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position.  Implied in our outlook is for fourth quarter comp store sales to be down low to mid-single digits. As Hal mentioned, we anticipate continued discerning consumer spending and unfavorable compares relating to weather as we experience the ongoing El Nino pattern, combined with the cycling of last year's monumental winter storm, which drove 200 basis points of favorable impact on comps.  We anticipate continued strength in our core year-round categories, yet the softness in demand for seasonal and discretionary will continue to limit the top side on our performance. As a reminder, we are also lapping the 53rd week, which included an extra week of sales in the prior year, contributing approximately $225 million to top line sales and $0.16 of diluted earnings per share.  As for retail price increases, our plans reflect a continued moderation of inflation. While still positive, we believe it will be modest. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion year-over-year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and our new distribution center, along with some pressure from an unfavorable product mix. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued SG&A deleverage given our investments and the expected comparable store sales declines.  As we shared last quarter, for modeling purposes, the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024, based on when the store is converted to our point of sale system. Most stores converted to our point of sale during Q2 and Q3 of this year. As is customary, we will provide our guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We're still finalizing our outlook for sales, as there are a number of puts and takes to be considered. Let's start with the fact that we're a needs-based, demand-driven business, with a long history of positive comps.  Additionally, as we see 2024 today, we expect we'll have less benefit from inflation, but we're 18 months into cycling big ticket softness. And the weather, hopefully, cannot be worse than it was this year. But we do anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging with a higher than normal degree of uncertainty and ongoing pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets.  As we've shared over the last couple of years, we've always planned that 2023 would be our peak capital investment level. With that as a backdrop, we plan to prudently invest in our strategic priorities in 2024, with next year's net capital spending in the 600\u2019s, which will relieve some depreciation expense. We remain excited about the progress on our Life Out Here strategy and are very pleased with our initiatives.  Our 10th distribution center will open during the second quarter of 2024. Much like our distribution center opening this year, this new DC benefits gross margin, but will pressure our SG&A as the facility ramps up. The gross margin benefits typically lag the opening by about one quarter.  Similar to 2023, we anticipate executing approximately 15 existing store sale leaseback transaction in 2024 to fund the own development new store program, and we anticipate the opening of 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 Petsense locations.  Over our history, we have continually adapted to the operating environment around us. The needs-based, demand-driven characteristics of our product offerings support our ability to continue to be a winner in retail. We will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well, all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy.  Now, I will turn the call over to Hal to wrap us up. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. As the calendar shifts to the fall and winter season, our stores and online are ready for the change in typical Tractor Supply fashion. Our merchandising team has been working closely with our vendors on plans for the holiday season, with an emphasis on new products and innovation, and very notably with a focus on value.  As the largest player in our sector, it is our obligation to be the advocate for value for our customers. And we are working hard to roll back the cost absorbed over the past two years. We will continue to be the destination for value and quality across our merchandising lineup.  In key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value, including exciting programs such as Columbia Performance Hunting Gear and our line of Grand Teton Pellet Stoves. In our CUE categories, we have the right selection at the right price, with a focus on value, and are committed to being in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles.  For example, you will see wood pallet stack outs in the majority of our stores in preparation for the winter season. And right now, our 400-plus garden centers are showcasing pumpkins, mums, and fall harvest decor. And this year we expanded our Halloween and harvest decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love for decorating their homes with on-trend seasonal indoor and outdoor decor, including a skeleton cow that was a TikTok viral sensation.  Additionally, and particularly in light of the continued warmer weather, we continue to be the destination for our customers' sporting goods, outdoor recreation, and outdoor wildlife interest, with products like our exclusive Royal Wing Bird Seed, Cannon Gun Safe, exclusive county line log splitters, and the Blackstone Griddle. Earlier this week, we announced the addition of Yeti products to our lineup in our Fusion stores. We're especially excited to collaborate with a well-regarded brand like Yeti that brings a long-standing reputation for quality and durability and aligns with our customers' interest in camping, fishing, hunting and all outdoor activities.  Our stores and garden centers will soon be filled with Christmas trees, wreaths and poinsettias. In addition to live goods, our customers can look forward to unique and different decor items, including our popular six-foot chicken lawn decorations and farm-themed holiday gingerbread kits. When it comes to gifts, we have compelling values and buys in every section of our store, from tools and grills to even fun, rural unique items like a 12-volt zero-turn ride-on toy lawnmower. From a calendar perspective, it's a good setup this year, with 31 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And Christmas falls on a Monday, so we anticipate a strong full weekend of sales prior to Christmas. We have a strong holiday season playbook with an exciting day-after-Thanksgiving day plan as well, with compelling offers programmed throughout the season. As we plan for the season though, we acknowledge there is a broader range of estimates for holiday consumer spending than we've seen over the last couple of years.  As we enter the fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve several milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. Notably, we anticipate ending the year with 40% of our store base in the Project Fusion format and nearly 500 garden centers, both significant milestones to initiatives that we began less than three years ago. Our real estate pipeline is robust, with plans for 80 new Tractor Supply stores also in 2024.  We're piloting artificial intelligence in many functions in the business, including marketing, supply chain, and technology development. And one particular application that I'm very excited about is our generative AI knowledge tool that we call \u2018Hey Gura.\u2019 Using a proprietary AI engine that we built, we're able to deliver knowledge directly to our team members through the headsets that each wear to augment their individual experience. Let me give you an example of this. One of the questions recently asked by a team member is, when do you switch from crumble feed to pellet for baby chicks? When asked, the Hey Gura app responded, \u2018Typically chickens switch from crumble to pellet feed when they reach about 15 to 18 weeks of age, depending on breed and development.\u2019 To-date, the results have been excellent. Our team members are really embracing and excited about the technology, and it's been a great value-add feature for our leading customer service.  We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our current trends to these expectations as transitory and specific to the economic environment. This team is dialed in and understands the challenges. As we're entering one of the busiest periods in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation goes out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value.  And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question, Scot Ciccarelli. Given the decline in same-skew inflation and growing concerns, we may see a deflationary environment in pet food and feed. Can you help us understand, at least generally, how you're thinking about the impact of inflation or deflation for \u201824, especially in your CUE categories? Kurt Barton : Hey Scott. This is Kurt, and good morning. First, let me just start by saying, we still see an environment where there's some net inflation year-over-year while modest. Inflation is clearly slowing, but not turning to deflation at this point. And specific to some of the categories, we are seeing, there's areas this year where there's year-over-year deflation, particularly areas like bird feed, livestock feed, corn based. Yeah, there's some level of deflation.  But there's areas like you mentioned, where we're still seeing some level of inflation still in the system, such as pet food. And then there's most of our areas in our product categories, what I describe as they've hit a plateau. It's stable, and we're running pretty consistent. And as that moves to the pipeline, very much consistent with our outlook for this year and beyond, was that we start to moderate down to a low single digit level of inflation in 2023.  Too early to really say for 2024, but the general call would be that things begin to stabilize. Inflation, deflation is not as much of a factor in the average ticket that it's been over the past few years, and it's more stabilized and neutralish. And we're certainly focused on it. This team works consistently in environments of change and inflation, deflation, have a history performing very well. Know that we're monitoring it. I'll be able to share more information on that in the fourth quarter call when we give our outlook for 2024. Scot Ciccarelli : That's really helpful. And then just for clarification, if we were to get same skew deflation, should we expect it to result in gross margin expansion? I think that used to be a general rule of thumb for you guys as we go back to pre-pandemic days. Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, in general, our history has been that in a deflationary environment we're able to leverage our scale, manage our retail pricing. It generally produces a benefit on the rate, just like inflation did over the last few years, put a bit of pressure on that rate. And we managed both environments very well, and historically it's been as you described it. Scot Ciccarelli : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Hal, Kurt, Seth. Maybe just a focus on capital spending plans for next year. I think you guys mentioned sort of in the $600 million range. I was curious Kurt, if you can maybe help us explain the year-over-year change, and if there's any part of the strategic investment plan that you're pulling back on for any particular reason. Hal Lawton : Yeah. Hey, Steven. The biggest change, very much consistent with what we expect when we said peak years of 2022 and 2023, are those big investments in the distribution centers. We will open that second new distribution center next year in 2024, but a majority of that capital is in 2023. So on a net capital spend that we're forecasting in the $725 to $775, if you back off of that into the $600\u2019s, the biggest majority of that is supply chain.  There's other efficiencies in there, such as we continue on our investments in the stores, such as Fusion and Garden Centers to re-engineer and find efficiencies in our investments. Really excited about the two newest formats that we are rolling out in the stores that we've been able to re-engineer and drive costs out of our Garden Center, and that's giving us even lower cost debt. And then maybe the third thing would be the investments we made in 2023 on integration and remodeling the Orscheln stores. We'll be rolling off of that. I think those three things are the biggest difference, but no shift in our strategic investments. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Peter Benedict : Hey guys, thanks. Kurt, just leveraging off Steve's question there, the prudent investment approach on the CapEx side. Can you walk that over to the SG&A side of the P&L and talk about what it kind of means? You've spoken to 85% of the growth in SG&A coming from some of these investments. How does that kind of \u2013 maybe that growth cadence inflect next year?  And then secondly, your ability to kind of manage the core bucket, I guess the non-investment related bucket in the event that your comps remain challenged, let's say through \u201824. Let's just call it flat for argument's sake. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yeah, Peter. On SG&A, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I felt one of the highlights was how the team managed pivoting off of a number of years and quarters with strong top line sales, to scale to the appropriate level of volume for Q3. And it just shows our ability to be agile in that case.  To your point on the 85% was growth, some of the things that really played out to help drive the core SG&A to a really low growth level. First area, supply chain, and I mentioned this in the previous last couple quarters. We had built the supply chain almost through muscle, 3PL, other areas that distribution centers were running at max capacity or above that level and that was inefficient.  We've been able to shut off some of the 3PL higher costs. The team is running at some of the highest level of productivity. So one of our biggest areas of leverage in a flat to slight negative comp sales environment was our distribution supply chain, as they actually leveraged as a percent of sales because of productivity. John and team focusing on scaling down task or non-customer service work to modestly drive hours down, that also reflects some of the SG&A benefits.  In general, in an environment that there is softer demand at Tractor Supply, as we look ahead to even future quarters and next year, we'll plan and scale our core levels of investments and our operating expenses in line with our sales growth.  And then from there, this team will continue to claw back inflationary pressures, even in operating expenses that have embedded over the last few years. And this is a team that's been built with lean management, continuous improvement in our DNA, and we have profit improvement goals. And those are all things as we plan ahead to 2024 that gives us confidence in our ability to manage and still hold to our long-term algorithm and targets on operating margin. Peter Benedict : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with DA Davidson. Your line is now open. Michael Baker : Excuse me, thanks. Two-part question, I guess. I wanted to ask about your discretionary and seasonal business. You talk about your discretionary business being 15% of sales, but why wouldn't you consider the seasonal business to be discretionary, as well as that seems to be able to ebb and flow based on the seasons?  And I guess the second part of that is, you said the fall/early winter businesses start off slow. Are those loss sales or just delayed? Like, if it does eventually get cold, which presumably it will, how do you think those sales pick back up? Hal Lawton : Yeah, hey Michael, good morning. Thanks for the question. Appreciate your participation in the call. You know, as it relates to discretionary, just one would acknowledge 15%-ish of our business kind of big ticket discretionary, mid-single digit negative comps, a slight improvement from sequentially from what we saw in the first half of the year, kind of in line with what we expected.  The myth throughout the entirety of this year for us has been our seasonal businesses. Our CUE business continues to perform very strong, with comps well above our reported total company comp performance with significant share gains happening in our CUE business. On our Q2 call or Q1 and Q2 calls, when we talked about seasonal, we acknowledged that there could be an element of the consumer spending discretionary piece that kind of seeps into that seasonal business. I would characterize the fall and winter business, though, more demand driven needs based than even spring, because in the winter, the businesses that are really strong for us and large and robust are things like wood pellets and propane.  In fact, three of our top 10 skews during the winter season are two wood pellet skews and the propane skew. Those are demand driven needs based. When it's cold, people, are burning the pellets in their wood stoves or they are using propane for heating other homes or supplemental heating. And when it's not cold, they are not. And this time last year, actually as we entered Q3, the last week of Q2 and as we entered Q3, it was we had cooler weather and then that continued throughout the balance of Q3.  We didn't, have that at all this year. And then even as we're heading into Q4 here, it's going to be 80 degrees this weekend in Boston. You just don't need wood pellets and you don't need propane during that time. And so you can see it very clearly in our business.  On the flip side, we are seeing strength in outdoor projects, outdoor wildlife, those sorts of categories, whether it's grilling, whether it's deer corn and the deer hunting season. You can certainly see it in the lawn and garden categories, even in riding lawnmowers. Those businesses this time of year though are just not large enough to offset. Even with nice growth in those categories, they are just not large enough to offset those sorts of pieces that are demand driven.  We also do sell a lot of insulated outerwear type categories, whether its coats and a lot, fleece lined pants and those sorts of things, gloves, boots. I think as it gets cold, I would expect those to not be lost sales. But there is an element of like wood pellets and propane that once you don't have that cold weather, you do lose it. I think we are being prudent in our implied guidance for the fourth quarter. Last year, we didn't have \u2013 it was not \u2013 it was a warmish November. So there \u2013 but we know there's an El Nino that's in forecast right now. And so we just thought it'd be prudent to not assume that we'd have any upside as we lapped that in November, as we talked about in our prepared remarks.  And then of course we're hurtling [ph] or we\u2019re comping on top of a robust storm from last year that, as we noted in our Q4 earnings call last year, contributed two points of comp to the quarter. Michael Baker : Excuse me. Thanks. That's helpful. So it sounds like those seasonal categories are non-discretionary, but only if the weather cooperates. Is that a fair way to put it? Hal Lawton : Yeah, I think that's a fair way to \u2013 that's an absolutely fair way to say it. Michael Baker : Excellent! I appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. One of the debates on the Tractor Supply Story over the long term is the company has a gross margin right now that's 150 basis points. That's higher than it was prior to the pandemic. So what gives you confidence on the long-term outlook, especially as this has become a more profitable business? What's a realistic expectation that you can hold on to this increased profitability? And then I have one quick follow-up. Kurt Barton : Yeah, Michael, this is Kurt. Gross margin has certainly been not only a high point for this quarter, this year, but to your point, what we've been able to accomplish, leveraging our scale and size in the last years has been a real testament to the team.  I'll give you a few examples of why we believe this is a sustainable gross margin, and most of it is around the structural nature of it. As you think ahead, I'll first acknowledge, as we continue to grow in CUE and take market share, it puts a little bit of pressure from product mix. And we've been cycling and absorbing those gross margin expansions with higher pressure from CUE mix in the past few years, more than we would see going forward.  Supply chain benefits have really been one of the top two areas of gross margin expansion. And we've seen and come off some of the highest supply chain costs. We've absorbed some of the inefficiencies in the robust, fast growth period. So the supply chain costs, declining transportation costs, improvement in the reduced miles from new distribution centers are all structural.  And as you think about transportation costs, you think about it as in this particular time, we are still in an environment where transportation costs, both domestic and import, are higher than the pre-pandemic levels. I'm not saying that we expect to revert back to pre-pandemic norms, but I think the important thing is that we're not coming off of a new extreme low, but yet coming off of some of the highs. And then the second most impactful piece of gross margin is the structural sustained difference of coming off promotionals that were embedded into our normal programs and really leveraging EDLP and Neighbor\u2019s Clubs. So the biggest drivers are structural. We expect to be able to change those. And the benefit that our fast team has driven in our production, not only in sales, but the funding from our vendors is structurally in there as well.  So we anticipate to be able to have continued gross margin expansion. And even next year, as you think about seasonal, it may be able to bounce back and that has higher margins. So we have a lot of expectations on our ability to sustain and even expand gross margin for those reasons. Michael Lasser : Got you. My follow-up question is you provided some initial observations on next year. Macro is going to be tough, we'll see what happens with the weather, less inflation benefit. So in light of all those comments, how low can your comp be and you still maintain flat overall EPS next year versus this year? Kurt Barton : Yeah. I'll take that one. I mean, I'd have to just go to this is still very early in our planning cycle. This business has been resilient in regards to our ability to maintain our comp sales. It's so much of a needs based core business in there that we are planning for some uncertainty. There are some headwinds on the consumer, but we got strong strategic initiatives. We're lapping some difficult challenges from the seasonal business. And we can be nimble, but I'm just not going to try to predict or go down a path of what level of comps or how low it could be because this business has a track record. In 30 years we've had one year of negative comps and it was ever so slightly. And we're confident in our ability to produce strong sales performance. Hal Lawton : And the only thing that I would add is. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Hal Lawton : Hey Michael, the only thing I would add is, Kurt\u2019s prepared remarks talked about our commitment to our long-term operating margin guidance, inclusive of next year. I'd also add, we see a lot of opportunities for continued operating expense control next year, namely as Kurt mentioned, freight and a number of other levers.  And I think we've demonstrated this year that we have a number of levers that we can pull to continue to support the underlying profitability of the business, and also can control what we can control. We certainly don't see an outlook next year as you implied, as potential for negative decline in EPS. I mean, if you look at the underlying strength of our business, whether it's in consumer, our number of shoppers in our stores, our customer satisfaction, our market share gains, all those sorts of things, we've never been more confident in the underlying foundation of our business. Michael Lasser : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. Your line is now open. Oliver Wintermantel : Yeah, thanks. I was looking for your guidance for the fourth quarter comp, the low single digits to mid-single digit decline. Kurt, how do you expect transactions versus ticket are performing in that kind of environment in regards of last year's, the winter storm? Is it mostly in transactions that are going to decline in the fourth quarter? Kurt Barton : Oliver, yeah, I'd frame it up as it's going to be a mix of both of those. We had, a slight average ticket decline in Q3. Some of those pressures on average ticket will, we expect to persist into Q4. But transactions are what gets impacted and did get impacted by the monumental winter storm last year.  With our expectations, as we mentioned, this is not framing up to be an ideal fourth quarter weather. That demand would play out in transactions, and in our evaluation, it's going to be a mix of both transactions and ticket. And implied in our guidance would be a negative comp transaction for that reason. Oliver Wintermantel : Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is now open. Ryann Mushkin : Good morning. This is Ryan on for Scott. Thanks for taking our question. Our research would suggest that there is an opportunity to have stores get deliveries from the distribution centers more frequently. Do you agree? And if so, what do you think the sales opportunity may be? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Good morning and thank you for your question. First off, I'd say this is an area that we have been focused on for the last few years. We've gone from roughly five mixing centers to 15 mixing centers over the last three years. That has given us the ability to have more replenishment going into the stores of full pallet quantities of our big moving SKUs. The second thing is the expansion of our DCs from eight to nine and the next year 10. Also gives us additional outbound capacity to be able to deliver more frequently to our stores. We now have over, I think it's 500 or 600 stores now that receive shipments twice a week from our distribution centers. The remaining stores all receive shipments once a week. So it's not that we have stores receiving it less than that. But yeah, we're constantly looking at ways we can drive in stock.  What I would leave you with is, our in stock rate right now is the best it's been, as Kurt said in his prepared remarks, really since the pandemic began. We feel very good about our in stock rates right now. Our team's done an excellent job, I think, managing inventory. If you look at our inventory growth, it's in control. If you look at our in stock rates, they are excellent. You look at our shrink numbers below last year and that last year was below two years ago. So I think on all sides of inventory, quality, quantity, in stock rates, we feel very good. But continue to challenge yourself to increase frequency and get smarter and smarter in our tools, like our new RELEX replenishment and allocation system to be able to keep improving our performance on inventory. But, I feel very good about it. As I said, our in stock rates are the best they've been really since the pandemic. Ryann Mushkin : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Chris Horvers : Thanks very much. So following up on some of the prior questions, you are assuming comps are down roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. And you also said that your business has a long history of positive comp, sort of alluding that \u201824 would be positive. So, I guess what's unique to the fourth quarter? I understand there's two points of weather lap year-over-year. Why wouldn't the business be positive in that quarter if weather is sort of the only variable that's been the unknown? Hal Lawton : Hey, good morning, Chris. And thanks for your question and participation in the call. I would just reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks, that we continue to see the consumer being discerning in their spend, particularly in discretionary. I mean, I think we've all seen the charts on PCE spend and the shift from goods to services. We've all been looked at how good spending is occurring and how that's shifting across the various retail sectors. The sector we play in is the most sticky, the least impacted by that. You go look at electronics and appliances. You look at furniture. You look at home improvement. You look at all the other categories. They are all performing well below kind of our normal, our sector. But nonetheless, we are seeing some modest impact from the discerning spend.  We also said weather is not off to a great start for us in Q4. There's a very strong El Nino pattern occurring. That typically is a warmer winter season. It's 80 degrees this weekend in Boston. And then as you said, we're lapping the strong storm from last year, which we recorded two points to.  So we just think you put all that together and it's appropriate to be prudent in our outlook for the fourth quarter in that kind of mid-single digit, low to mid-single digit current negative, and I don't think it's indicative of anything structural in the business.  We see it as very transitory to the current moment. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had active customer growth in Q3. We had new customer growth in Q3. We had reactivated customer growth in Q3. Our customer satisfaction scores are at all-time highs.  Our market share gains are very strong right now across the board. In PET, this past quarter, our share gains were as strong as they've been since the pandemic. And again, our underlying business is very strong. I'm confident that in the context of retail goods spending, even though the tide is shifting out for all, that we're going to be standing tall amongst that. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then my follow-up is just on the consumer broadly. It is a needs-based business. How is the consumer changing? Because I think if you look across retail right now, you're not the only one who is seeing weakness, and it seems like it has deteriorated a bit. So are some of the things that you're talking about in terms of units per transaction and the usage of credit, is your view that there has been some degree of deterioration in the consumer over the past six months or so? Hal Lawton : I'd start by saying what is our value proposition? And our value proposition is to be that dependable supplier for life out here. And again, I'd reiterate, we're seeing the customers in our stores. They are shopping us at record levels.  That said, when they are shopping us, they are spending a little bit less items per basket, right, kind of to the tune of a low single-digit headwind, and they are pulling back a little bit on discretionary. Those are consistent themes that we've had really for the last few quarters.  We haven't really seen any acceleration in that. It's really been more of a consistent theme. But again, for us, the seasonal weather, the seasonal businesses have been a huge departure from what our outlook and expectations have been all year long.  But nonetheless, I think you're going to continue to see for the near term, the consumer spend continuing to shift to services from goods and kind of rebalancing. And I think you're going to see discretionary retail businesses continuing to take the brunt of that as we turn the quarter of this year into next year. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. Mary Winn Pilkington : As we've hit the top of the hour \u2013 Melissa [ph], as we've hit the top of the hour, I think this wraps up our call. So thank you everyone for joining us and I'm available for follow-up, and we'll look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter earnings call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this morning. In 2023, Tractor Supply celebrated our milestone 85th anniversary. Over 85 years, Tractor Supply has been a growth company with a clear purpose to help our customers live Life Out Here. Since 1938, we've operated in all types of economic conditions, embraced innovation and adapted to changing times. We've elevated the farm and ranch channel, bringing the sophistication of other retail categories to improve the shopping journey and ensure we have scalable platforms. Tractor Supply's needs-based, demand-driven business model has stood the test of time. No doubt this past year has proved challenging, more top feature than we expected with the beginning of the year with unfavorable weather, rising interest rates and inflation impacting consumer spending habits, but we believe these headwinds are temporary. We continue to invest for growth in 2023, and gain market share along the way, especially in companion animal and livestock feed. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of the team's significant accomplishments across Tractor Supply in the year and over the last few years. As I reflect on 2023, our Tractor Supply team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our customers and our communities, and our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro and other headwinds, while also building our future. I sincerely thank them for living our mission and values. In 2023, we faced the well-documented macro headwinds that weighed on consumer goods spending, particularly discretionary goods, as well as unfavorable weather impacts every quarter on our business. While we've made progress over the years to deseasonalize our business, we will always be the reliable supplier for our customers for their seasonal needs like heating fuel and fertilizer. We estimate that adverse weather conditions negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 200 basis points for the full year, including the lapping of the late December winter storm in 2022. Personal consumption expenditures saw strong mid single-digit growth in 2023. That said, spending on goods as a percent of PCE declined nearly a point as consumers continue to shift spending on services back to pre-COVID levels. In particular, this affected our big ticket business, which represents a little over 10% of our sales and had a negative 6% comp for the year. Despite the headwinds we faced, we remain committed to our journey of transforming Tractor Supply. Since introducing our Life Out Here strategy in October of 2020, we have dramatically transformed Tractor Supply. Over this time, we've invested nearly $2.5 billion in capital spending with about 80% of that spend targeted for growth initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. This includes new and remodeled stores new distribution centers, upgrading our technology infrastructure and several other strategic investments. We've also significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint and delivering on the increased volume of consumable, usable and edible products. Additionally, our average store volume continues to far exceed pre-pandemic levels, going from $4.5 million to $6.5 million annually per store. Approximately 40% of our stores are in the Project Fusion layout, allowing us to drive improved space productivity. We continue to see a mid single-digit comp lift benefit in the first year from our Fusion remodel. We will enter the spring of 2024 with more than 450 garden centers that are also driving space productivity, while allowing us to enter into new categories that resonate with our customers' hobbies for gardening and their needs for outdoor products. Stores with our garden centers are attracting new customers at a faster pace than the rest of the chain. Additionally, our garden center stores are providing a multiyear comp benefit. Our distribution centers achieved a record year of productivity. The opening of our Novar [ph], Ohio DC in January 2023 allowed us to unlock savings across our network with the largest rebalancing of our stores ever. This provided us with substantial stem mile savings, while also allowing for significantly improved service to our stores. Also importantly, our supply chain team member attrition reduced materially as we implemented a new progressive wage scale. And no doubt, these investments are resonating with our customers, as we have achieved record high customer satisfaction scores throughout the year. As always, our store managers were critical to the success and importantly, we achieved a near all-time low of 12% attrition in this group. Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Now let's go through some of the specific highlights to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. For the year, we achieved record sales of $14.6 billion. Our comp store sales were even with the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $10.09. This comes on top of record performance over the last three years. We continue to have solid market share gains across our major product categories. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1 billion annually for the first time. Since launch, we have had over 7 million downloads of our mobile app and over 2 million in the year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales declined 4.2%. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.28 with operating profit margin expansion of 16 basis points. For the second consecutive year, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Strategically, the transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that are designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin reinforces our long-term guidance. In 2023, we raised our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion, our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores from our previous target of 2,800. We also implemented new capabilities to enable own development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allow for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Our real estate capabilities are a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. In 2023, the cadence of new store openings returned to a more normalized rate. We opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores in 13 Petsense stores in 2023. The team has done a great job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency for Tractor Supply. During the year, we successfully converted the 81 Orscheln stores acquired in 2022 to the Tractor Supply brand, representing essentially a year's worth of new store growth. We're very pleased with the opportunity to drive both top line and bottom line performance of these locations closer to our standard run rates over time. Total customer count increased 1%. As we had positive growth in active customers and new reactivated customers. Neighbor's Club added more than 4 million new customers and represented 77% of our sales for the year, our highest mark to date. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the year, we reached a new record for the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping us more frequently, and spending more money per transaction. Last year's re-branding a Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply, along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense, is also resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new Out Here pet customers to both banners. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 70% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping at Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 47%. Petsense is also helping us gain share across pet specialty as we approach $225 million in sales and our 200 store milestone in the Petsense brand. For the year, our financial services offering of our private label credit card, together with our co-branded credit card outpaced our overall sales with strong growth. Our penetration increased from last year's record level and is now in the high single digits in overall sales. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. During the year, we opened up our ninth distribution center in Novar, Ohio and broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Mall mill, Arkansas. These were investments were to enable the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. These investments in our DC network are complemented by our 15 mixing centers that are there for high-velocity replenishment items. In 2023, we moved nearly \u00a38.5 billion of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the largest seller of packed feeding food for livestock and companion animals in the United States. Our scale and reach provides us with the cost to serve that is lower than our farm and ranch competition and any other competitor in these markets. As we executed the third year of our Life Out Here long-term strategy, 2023 was a year that we made significant progress. We plan to continue building on that progress in 2024. Most of what you'll hear from us today, we'll sell all that different from the playbook we've used for the last two to three years but that's intentional as we continue to be pleased with the benefits and financial returns of our strategic investments. As I've shared many times, our biggest challenge is prioritizing the plethora of growth opportunities we have ahead of us. And we anticipate 2024 to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook with it being below our long-term target. We remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when macro conditions return to neutral. Our underlying assumptions start with consumers continuing to be judicious and they're spending on good. Additionally, we anticipate average ticket to be pressured as we lap inflation. We're assuming market share gains that are supported by our strategic initiatives will continue. Housing, oil, agriculture and weather are anticipated to be neutral factors in our guidance. Collectively, all these factors are considered to help us provide the guidance range that Kurt will share with you more later on. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a needs-based business that is tailored to our Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. I want to start by reiterating Hal's comments on 2023 and our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Tractor Supply. Over my 2.5 decades in this business, I've never seen a year where we've had many transitory headwinds as we did in 2023 that did not break positively at some point during the year. Before I get into my review of the quarter, I wanted to address two items. First, for comparability purposes, please keep in mind, 2022 had a 53rd fiscal week that provided a net sales benefit of $225 million to the prior year fourth quarter, representing about 5.6 percentage points of our net sales decline this quarter. On a full year basis, it negatively impacted net sales by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, diluted EPS in 2022 benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year from the 53rd week. Second, overall, the unseasonably warm winter weighed on our results in the fourth quarter. We estimate the impact to be approximately 400 basis points of pressure on our comp sales performance. We knew this was going to be the most challenging quarter of the year, given our strong comp performance of 8.6% in the prior year as we were cycling the late December 2022 winter storm that provided a 200 basis point comp benefit to the fourth quarter of last year. The majority of the pressure was in transactions, given the needs-based nature of our business and it impacted our seasonal categories across Q and other winter goods. Our Q business in the fourth quarter has a higher mix of cold weather seasonal products such as wood pellets, bulk propane, bird feed and pine savings for bedding. From the cadence of the quarter to our product categories, seasonal impacts always play into our performance. Coming into the fourth quarter, we anticipated it would work against us and the quarter played out much like we expected. Factoring in the seasonal impact from the weather, our fourth quarter performance was very much in line with our run rate from last quarter. Most of my remaining commentary of our comp sales performance is on a normalized basis, adjusting for the impact of weather. October and November were very similar in comp sales performance, with December seeing the biggest comp sales decline as we were lapping the winter storm from last year. On a normalized basis, all months performed relatively consistent with a slight decline in comp sales. Turning to our product categories. We continue to see solid performance in Q with above chain average comps, essentially flat for the quarter. On a normalized basis, Q had a positive comparable sales as we continue to gain share. Discretionary categories performed in line with our expectations with a mid single-digit comp sales decline. Big ticket performance showed a continued improvement over the trends of the previous five quarters. Comparable big ticket sales ran slightly negative for the quarter and were positive in the low single digits on a normalized basis. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance in the week leading up to Christmas. As we have experienced all year, we saw a continued slowdown in retail price inflation throughout the year, with Q4 experiencing a slight net deflation. We have successfully managed through deflation in various commodities throughout 2023, and believe we are nearing the trough now. In 2023, raw material inputs rolled over as evidenced by the 35% decline in corn from its most recent high in 2022 and currently running about 15% above the historical average. As we exit 2023, these types of feedstock declines are already reflected in our retail prices. Structural inflationary factors such as higher wage rates, transportation costs and other overhead items are all still supporting higher product costs. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our trend of strong gross margin performance continued with a year-over-year improvement of 129 basis points to 35.3% of sales. Our gross margin expansion was led by improvements in the supply chain from lower transportation rates and efficiencies in our network, including opening a new DC. We continue to benefit from our commitment to everyday low prices, and disciplined product cost management. While our promotional activity was modestly greater than the prior year, we were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. These favorable drivers were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shift due to a higher mix of Q and a lower mix of high-margin seasonal categories. As a percent of that sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 113 basis points year-over-year to 26.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A, although to a lesser extent than last quarter. The SG&A deleverage was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation and the benefits of the sale-leaseback program initiated last quarter. In Q4, we sold five Tractor Supply stores, which contributed a 40 basis point benefit to SG&A. Operating margin improved 16 basis points for the quarter to 9.1%. Excluding the cycling of the 53rd week, diluted EPS of $2.28 was essentially flat with the prior year. Our new store pipeline continues to be strong. Our new store sales and profitability numbers continue to outperform historical averages. Given the addition of the Orscheln stores to our non-comp sales numbers, the new store productivity metric for the organic new Tractor Supply stores is cloudy in our external reporting. By our calculations, TSC new store productivity in 2023 was about 67% of our mature store average. Average sales in year one of a new store have increased more than 40% compared to 2019, in line with the performance of the chain. Our stores continue to be profitable in year one, cash flow positive at about the same point and have a payback in two to three years. Our new store economics unlock sustainable growth and solidify our lead in the channel. Strong new store economics are a hallmark of Tractor Supply. As I reflect back on 2023, I continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our business and the structural nature of it. Now let's move to our outlook for 2024. Hal shared how we are thinking about the macro backdrop for the coming year. We are anticipating a gradual slowdown with the lingering question of do we have a soft landing or if the risk of a harder recession remains. With this in mind, we have taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook and have forecasted our comparable sales performance below our long-term algorithm. Navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have successfully managed through diverse market conditions, including periods of inflation to disinflation and even deflation. Our deep understanding of these dynamics allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. We expect average unit retails to be neutral to a modest headwind for the near term, as we anticipate stickiness to input costs such as labor wage rates and other items to mitigate any further reversion in commodity pricing. For fiscal 2024, we are forecasting net sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion. Comparable store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down a modest 1% to an increase of 1.5%. We are cautiously optimistic that big ticket trends will revert to positive for the full year as we are cycling 18 months of declines. We expect gross margin expansion of about 40 to 60 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost management and a moderation of the mix impact of Q. We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase in the mid-teens. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate, we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales. Second, we plan to open our tenth distribution center in the second quarter. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. Our DC network is expected to pressure SG&A by approximately 10 to 15 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. As a result, we expect modest pressure on our operating margin from the opening of this new DC. These two primary factors are partially offset by the lapping of some higher-than-normal medical benefits in 2023. We do not expect those to reoccur due to our proactive changes to our benefit programs. In 2024, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. We anticipate these sales will occur in the second half of the year on a similar cadence to 2023 and with a similar EPS contribution. We continue to forecast these strategic sale leasebacks to be ongoing for the next 7 to 10 years. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 10.1%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of approximately two times, and we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23.0%. Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $9.85 to $10.50. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $625 million to $700 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales. This net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds for the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be in the range of $850 million to $925 million. Our capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening 10 to 15 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 2024. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid, and we expect store opening cadence B in line with 2024. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $575 million to $625 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Now I'd like to walk through a few items to consider for the calendarization of our expectations. As always, we believe the best way to look at our business is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2024 guidance. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be slightly more favorable in the first half as opposed to the second half. There are a few factors that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to benefit our results through the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. As a result, gross margin expansion for the first half of the year is anticipated to be near the high end of our annual guidance range, while the second half may be near the low end of the range. In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. Please keep in mind, we will be lapping an $0.08 per share benefit from the depreciation change in the third quarter of last year. Considering each of these factors, the third quarter will be our toughest earnings comparison as we anticipate a decline in operating margin and EPS due to the combination of these factors. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation beginning in the second quarter with a tiered approach as we cycle the timing of moving these stores to our point-of-sale systems and rebranding of stores to Tractor Supply. Specific to the first quarter, we had a challenging first quarter last year as it was abnormally warm in January and February and relatively cold March. We were also benefiting from retail price inflation in the high single-digits. Given the recent Arctic cold temperatures across most of the regions, we are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. To wrap up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market. We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2024. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thank you, Kurt. Now I'd like to update you on our progress on our Life Out Here strategy and share more about the exciting plans we have in place for the spring season. Tractor Supply continues to build on our competitive advantages. And arguably, the company is as strong as it's ever been. This is backed up by several proof points. We continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy with strong spending and retention with our best customers. Our strategic priorities are clearly resonating with our customers. We continue to see strength in our brand equity metrics, continue to grow our brand consideration and our unaided awareness. These strong customer trends are attributed to the team. The team is executing at a high level and is extremely engaged. In 2023, our turnover improved at every level across the company as we're committed to being an employer of choice in rural America. With customer satisfaction scores at an all-time high, the team is passionate about their work, and we're energized to capitalize on our growth investments to provide our customers with legendary service. Our strong culture has always been a part of our secret sauce. The team has dialed in and determined to build on our long track record of success. Our Life Out Here strategy is on point. Our strategic initiatives in Project Fusion, Garden Centers, Neighbor's Club and Digital are working and they are driving results. In 2024, we anticipate that our Project Fusion layout will be in about 50% of our store base by year-end. This layout is clearly driving improved comp sales force as we're leveraging category insights to determine space allocation and drive productivity. For instance, in the companion animal categories, we're seeing that the Fusion layouts are contributing to strong growth. We're able to have an expanded SKU offering and larger stack out. This layout is also seeing the highest quartile of customer satisfaction scores and attracting new customers at a faster rate. 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center for us. We will leverage the change of seasons across the storefront as the year shifts to spring. We will continue to build out about 150 garden centers across both new stores and sidelight transformations this year. As we look to leverage our learnings from our garden centers, we will implement a new live goods center prototype in many of these locations. This new prototype requires about half of the capital investment of a traditional garden center that we've been building over the last few years and allows us to maximize the value creation of a sideline in lower volume stores and in markets where the season is less extensive and thus allowing us to achieve the ROIs that we target. Additionally, the new prototype in many ways, makes it easier for our stores to operate from a staffing standpoint and the maintenance costs are lower. With more broadly than ever and a grower network to support our garden centers, we're excited about the benefit of these initiatives in 2024 and the continued opportunity to serve our customers. Now turning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to capitalize on this strategic asset. Our loyalty program has the scale and scope to continue to drive meaningful results. As we enter the third year since the move to a point-based rewards program, our members can expect more personalized offers, new tiers and more meaningful rewards. These compelling enhancements are designed to drive transactions and engagement, all while migrating customers upwards. Moving on to our digital business. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our growth, between our website and our mobile app, we have more visitors online now than we do in our stores. These digital assets are essentially the front door to Tractor Supply. We'll be focused this year on improving our digital customer experience and capability as we look to accelerate conversion rate. Just as the trip to a Tractor Supply store is highly differentiated, we'll be doubling down to ensure the shopping experience on our website and our mobile app has that same level of differentiation as we shop across our destination categories. We are looking to mirror our in-store legendary service and the digital experience through personalized and conversational commerce. We will leverage AI technologies to improve search, redesign our checkout, introduce a new refreshed homepage focusing on personalization that leverages our robust Neighbor's Club data. As our customer base continues to skew younger, these improvements will be key to unlocking future growth. Our strategic priorities are resonating with our customers and driving strong returns. As the calendar shifts now and we start to turn to spring, it's an exciting time to be in our stores and online. In 2024, our merchant teams will be as diligent as ever to be our customers' purchasing agent with a sharp focus on value and innovation. We're committed to everyday low price, and we simply will not be beyond value. Our customers can trust Tractor Supply to be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. Our merchandising strategies are focused to drive profitable sales and market share. Across product categories, we will have more innovation this year that I believe we will have seen collectively over the last three years. We have a number of new and exclusive product launches, including the introduction of the Toro HAVOC Zero-Turn Mower, the expansion of YETI and Solo Stove to more stores, and a test of Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer, a limited rollout of Priefert cattle fencing, and a limited rollout of Weber Grill, a relaunch of MuttNation from Miranda Lambert, and the addition of Triumph Equine Feed, and that's just to name a few of the new innovations that we're bringing to our customers, and they'll be able to find in-store and online. Let me share a few more highlights that you can see in our stores as you get out there. Tractor Supply has long been a destination for zero-turn mowers with a Cub Kid ad and Bad Boy brand. The Toro Havoc addition will continue to reinforce that positioning. Outside of Toro's dealer network Toro HAVOC is exclusive to Tractor Supply with a sharp price point. This is a unique and differentiated platform in just in time for the spring season. In big ticket, our entire trail assortment over the $1,000 price point is unique and exclusive to Tractor Supply. Across specifications and features, our trailer offerings are designed to support our customers' lifestyle. Across our categories, we have a long history of test and learn, and we're excited about the expansion of several recent programs. After a very successful rollout to our Project Fusion stores, YETI will be expanded to nearly half of the chain by Q2 and rolled out to the balance of the chain by year-end. Another great example is Solo Stove, a high-quality outdoor wood burning fire pit that is a perfect fit for the outdoor enthusiasts in our customers. Given our customers' response to this product, we'll be expanding the top-selling SKUs of Solo Stove to more than 1,500 stores with the complete offering available online. Weber Grills is another leading brand that we're excited to pilot in 2024 after growing significantly our grills business over the last three years. The introduction of Weber positions us to expand our Grill lineup and continue to grow our market share in this rapidly growing category. Weber has long been one of America's leading barbecue grill brands and their products are highly complementary to our existing offering of Pit Box, Even Ambers and Blackstone Griddle. We're also excited about the newness being introduced in companion animal in the first quarter. First up is the relaunch of our MuttNation partnership with Miranda Lambert. Tractor Supply is the pet wellness destination out here, and we're introducing market-leading new brands like Native Pet and expanding our 4health exclusive brand supplement assortment, and our continued pursuit of taking market share, we're introducing new national brands also across cat food. We have new brands like Triumph, Equine feed and a continued focus on organic feeds across our large animal and poultry categories. And we're also expanding our deer wildlife sets to support our customers' hobby of cultivating feeding and watching their deer. We will continue to leverage our strong portfolio of exclusive brands to grow market share and offer great value. For instance, we're launching Groundwork's Bag Garden and Potting Soil at compelling price points to the leading national brands, and we'll be introducing Blue Mountain Tech with performance fabrication to appeal to our millennial customers. These are just two examples of the strong pipeline we have for newness in our exclusive brands, which represent nearly 30% of our sales. And finally, it wouldn't be spring at Tractor Supply without the launch of our annual Chick Days. The arrival of Chicks at our stores is a sure sign of spring and creates strong retail theater in our stores. Our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for. Poultry now rivals livestock and equine in size of our business. Recent trends have supported growth from existing customers, coupled with robust growth from new customers in the category and this is driving both trips and ticket to our stores. One exciting aspect of the new customers of the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our new unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. We're introducing impeccable a new exclusive brand at Chick Day with a poultry starter kit, poultry treats and even chick toys. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and we use this as a resource for all things related to home setting beyond poultry to expand them to categories like gardening. I hope you get a chance to experience the event in our stores. To wrap up, our customers continue to trust us for everything they need to care for their pets and animals, tend to their homes, farms and land, enjoy the great outdoors and generally just the live life out here. That purpose serving those who live life out here, drive meaning in what we do each day. Our future remains as bright as it ever has been. Thank you to our team members for your dedication at Tractor Supply and passion for serving our customers and to our customers for trusting us as your go-to supplier for life out here and to our 2,400 communities across Tractor Supply and Petsense for embracing us as part of the fabric of the communities we call home. Over time and over various cycles, I stand by the best three words to describe Tractor Supply are consistent, reliable and sustainable. These attributes allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. Here's to the next 85 years of serving life out here. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning. Starting with Q4, it sounds like October, November trends were a touch better than that down 4% comp. But December stepped down and January step back up. So just considering all the variability over the past couple of months, can you help us understand just the underlying run rate for the business, where you think it is today and what you think the path is back to the long-term growth algo. And then specifically, how are you thinking about the contribution of the internal drivers like lawn and garden and Neighbor's Club in 2024? Kurt Barton : Hey, Zach, this is Kurt. Good morning. In regards to the comp sales performance, I'll point back to some of the things I mentioned on our prepared remarks. For the fourth quarter, the best way to look at it is start with the backdrop that when we look at the seasonal performance, the challenge is about an extremely mild fourth quarter going up against an Arctic storm of last year, there's 400 basis points of pressure. October and November were unseasonably warm as well. So you've got negative low single-digits generally consistent when you normalize for the December storm across all of the months. And all of that principally in the weather-related categories that I pointed out on the call. So as I mentioned, the fourth quarter ran consistently with the trend rates of the third quarter. Our consumable or needs-based business continues to be running solid, especially the year-round non-seasonal-related categories, the strength in all of our feed and food, the confidence that we have comes from examples such as livestock feed, equine feed, poultry feed, wildlife supplies, cat and dog running unit positive comps in the fourth quarter. Some of that up against the last year pantry filling that happens in the last week of the year against that storm. So you could see the traffic that we get from the consumables, the stability of the core of our business running really strong. So we still have that and care that confidence that our customers are shopping us just as consistent as they were before. We have growth in active customers, Neighbor's Club contributing more. All of those are the drivers of the consistency of the business. Zach Fadem : Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So I guess a two-parter. So first, as you think about not putting weather into 2024 is a potential benefit, can you talk through that? Is that because you look at it, the headwind in 2023 as more of a lap? Or is it just -- you're just trying to be prudent in your outlook? And a second follow-up is we get a lot of questions about the competitive encroachment from the big box guys. So could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of where those competitors have rolled out and expanded farm and ranch assortment? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hey, Chris, thanks for joining the call this morning. Yeah, on weather, I think as we reflect on last year, we had a lot of discussion on weather times felt like we're playing meteorologists. And I think we just decided to be prudent as we look at this year, not look at whether it's potential upside or downside as we called out, there's a number of other factors that could also influence our sales as the year progresses whether that be the agriculture market, oil, housing, et cetera. And instead, we just chose to focus on for the purposes of our guidance and range of outcomes this year, really the factors that we think are going to have the most influence on our sales as we can see it right now, which are our continued market share gains, offsetting the shift still in consumer spending from goods to services, as well as disinflation, which is dominantly a first half issue. And then as it relates to competitive encouragement, I'd say we really haven't seen anything different in competitive activity for the foreseeable past. So it's been really, for the last -- since COVID, the competitive activity has been pretty stable, pretty rational. Our share gains continue to -- we continue to take share in the market, and really haven't seen anything out of the ordinary from a competitive perspective, whether that be in our farm and ranch -- core farm and ranch competitors or the multitude of other national retailers that we compete against as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Our question centered around SG&A. We just wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about wage growth in 2024, and how does incentive comp come into play in 2024? What happened regarding incentive comp in 2023, given the flat comp for the year? And how should we think about that. Kurt Barton : Yeah. Hey, Kate, this is Kurt. I'll take those. On wage rate growth, we are anticipating wage rate growth, slightly above the historical average is pre-pandemic. It varies across different areas of the business. But I'd center around a 3% to 4% range wage rate growth. We continue to see strong, solid workforce, unemployment continues to be low. Our culture, our teams continue to have all the success with hiring, but it's appropriate to anticipate that you'd be at that level of wage rate growth. In regards to incentive compensation, we're incentivized at all levels of the organization. In 2023, our performance from top and bottom line did underperform our original expectations. And so there was some modest leverage in 2023. So if you look at 2024, what's factored into our guidance into our SG&A is some normalization of incentive comp gives a modest 10 or 15 basis point deleverage, but that's all considered in the guidance that I gave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jason Haas : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, if you could comment on your expectation for new store productivity in 2024. And based on the math that we could do it, it looks like it's maybe going to be like around 60% or so. I know sometimes the math can be fuzzy from our perspective. So can you just talk about what's expected there? And if there's any reason why the initial productivity would be lower in 2024? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yeah, Jason, this is Kurt. I'll answer that question. On my prepared remarks, I was very specific on that on what is really driving our new store productivity. So I want to point everyone back to that. We continue to see the Tractor Supply consistent, strong new store productivity. 2023 ran at 67% new store productivity. The 80 stores that we plan for 2024 are expected to be coming out the gates very consistent in the same way and our new store maturation process of a four to five year 65% to 70% new store productivity is where we target and we expect 2024 with the strong pipeline that we've got, we believe an excited -- just as we have in 2023 about what these new stores will produce. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess, Kurt, maybe a question for you. As we think about the EBIT margin and how it toggles within your guidance range, roughly speaking, about 15 basis points up or down per point of comp move. If you guys -- if you think we see a scenario where your comps are either below the low end of your guide range or they come in above the high end of the range, any sense for how the incrementals or decrementals would look. Anything we should think about there is 15 basis points a good benchmark? Or just curious kind of your thoughts on that. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes. I'll give you a couple of points, Peter, on that. First, we've considered the micro strategic drivers, the macro favorable or unfavorable pressures for this year. We've given a guidance range, albeit slightly larger on the top and bottom line than we historically have that recognizes we're in a time of uncertainty. And so we believe all of those scenarios, any plausible, reasonable scenarios have been factored into our guidance. So we don't see likelihood outside of the downside of the guidance that we've given. That said, inside the guidance range, even outside of the guidance range, I'd point that the EBIT margin movement within sales range is not linear. And there's a number of factors, certainly with the level of gross margin or what might be a factor that's driving the low end of the range. A deflationary environment, for example, gives us upside on margin rate. So I would not point to any linear and even outside of the range when you start considering incentive comp and other things, it's not linear as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Can you help quantify the comp lift that you're baking into your model from your Garden Centers this year? I think you mentioned you have about 40% penetration now, and we know that the spring selling season was largely wiped out in 2023 and probably even 2022. And maybe any other color on the performance of the Garden Centers as that program matures? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, sure. Why don't I start with that, Scot, on the comp, and then I'll toss it to set a little bit on the performance of Garden Centers, some of the 2024 drivers, et cetera. Our expectation and how we've modeled in our long-term targets is still the same as our expectations for 2024. As we continue to add Garden Centers roughly 150 to 200 of those a year. And you get from Fusion and Garden Center mid-single-digit to high single-digit on combo lift as those mature in year one and then a lower benefit in like year two, but still a benefit over the chain, that roughly plays into our algorithm, and we would anticipate for this year to play similar to that the Fusion Garden Center initiative is driving -- give or take some roughly one point of comp in our guidance range. And Neighbor's Club is another initiative that's driving consumers to spend up the tiers, more transactions, getting more of their share of wallet is another driver. So just kind of pointing out the two biggest strategic initiative drivers, and then I'll toss it over to Seth, maybe to talk a little bit about what's driving the garden centers. Seth Estep : Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks, Scot, for the question. Scot, first, I'll just start with as we think about our garden center initiative, just the size of the addressable market there is over $20 billion. And as we know, it's a place where our customers participated, where they didn't necessarily look at us as their first and primary destination for those categories, and we believe we have significant share opportunities as we look at the lawn and garden segment. Over the course of the last three years, as Kurt has mentioned, we have really been focused on driving scale to build out our grower base and then build to the 450-plus garden centers where we'll be entering spring, which we really believe this is the year that the team is really going to be able to drive some sales. As we go into spring with those 450, I mean, obviously, we're focused on winning those spring categories as well as building out both fall and our winter seasonal related areas to make sure that we can leverage and maximize that footprint. Not just in the spring season, but also in the 12 months of the year. So, very excited about the work that the team has been doing, very excited about the size of the prize there, and I think this is the year which really all going to come together. We built scale and how those programs are going to be hitting stores. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open. Chuck Grom : Hey thanks very much. Happy New Year guys. Now that you've completed the Orscheln conversions, I guess I'm curious your outlook on sales productivity and margins of these locations. And I guess now that they're in the set, how does that compare to the legacy Tractor Supply stores? And when we look at 2024 and '25, how do we think about the sales maturation curve and the benefit to comps from those stores? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes, Chuck, this is Kurt. The Orscheln conversion went very well. All stores converted, as we mentioned, to the Tractor Supply brand. The first six to nine months of -- since the acquisition was a transition, a lot of noise through that. We now have them all branded Tractor Supply. The team is engaged. We've got the Tractor Supply products and services, our Tractor Supply, feed and food brands. And when we begin to cycle that in second quarter where we converted all over we do anticipate to see much like a new store maturation, perhaps we'll learn it in a similar type maturation curve, but we anticipate and have baked into our guidance some new store maturation type comp benefit from those 81 stores as well. And how it compares? We anticipate these markets from our real estate study that there is upside to the historical performance in those stores to be able to run in line with Tractor Supply averages. Albeit we've said it's very much in line with like a Midwest tractor supply average, which is a bit below the overall tractor supply average store level. So there's room to have these grow over time. And we're excited about our ability to capture new customers, bring them into Tractor Supply in these stores. And so overall, for 2024, even into 2025, we believe much like a new store, there's a benefit from the maturation. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. What if you assumed for input cost relief in 2024, especially key variables like transportation costs and commodity costs? And then how does that inform your view of the gross margin outlook for this year? Because it seems like the gross margin has been expanding significantly in part because of this relief? And is there a risk that at some point, Tractor Supply could invite more competition as its gross margin is about 150 basis points higher than it was in 2019? Thank you so much. Hal Lawton : Hey, Michael, good morning. Two things I'll hit on this. First is the long-term structural nature of our gross margin, and then I'll speak to the assumptions implied in 2024. On the long-term structural nature, there's two big shifts that I want to remind folks about that really have transferred rate out of gross margin and expense out of gross margin and into SG&A. The first one of those is our field activity support team. As we've mentioned, it's nearly a 1,800-person team that where the expense falls in our SG&A, but the offsetting support provided by our vendors falls in gross margin. As we've talked about that several times in the past, that's roughly in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 basis points of shift. Secondly, I would call out the continued transformation of our supply chain. From 2018 to 2023, our stem miles have reduced by 20%. And that basically means a truck going from a DC to a store. And so the impact of that is reduced freight cost on a like-for-like volume and rate basis versus, say, 2018, but there's obviously operating costs embedded in our G&A to run the two DCs we've opened since then and the 11 mixing centers that we've opened since then. That is a benefit of roughly 60 to 70 basis points of the delta there. So when you add the fast difference and you add the supply chain difference kind of, call it, 75% of the gross margin difference that you quoted that 150 basis points is structural in nature and really a shift from SG&A to gross margin rate. Now looking forward, I would say the balance that you see there in gross margin rate, I would attribute to our scale. As we talked about, we're almost double the size of the business that we were in 2018 when I quoted those stem miles. And that's accorded us the ability to obviously manage and run the business more productively, whether that's in freight and our negotiations with our freight providers or whether that's getting credit for our scale with our primary COGS vendors. As it relates to this year, we do see continued benefit in the freight market, particularly in the first half of the year, and we've talked about that, particularly in the back half of last year and also in the first and second quarter some, but we do see continued freight benefit. Also, as we've talked about in Q3 and Q4, and we also mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have been working very closely with our vendors on cost and have been rolling that cost where we've seen commodity prices come down and other cost impacts moderate or reduce. We started that work, as we mentioned in past earnings calls, really in the summer time and the impact of those cost reductions are forecasted in our margin rate assumptions that Kurt laid out in his prepared remarks. The last thing I'll mention is just on competition. We are as priced strongly in the market right now as we've been ever. And we have a number of initiatives that we have in place to really make sure we stand for value in the marketplace on our key, kind of, value indicating SKUs out there and feel really good about our price position and don't see any encroachment from competition just the same competitive intensity that we've seen over the last few years. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Seth Basham : Good morning. My question is on the companion animal category. And if you could comment on the performance of that category in the fourth quarter were comps up or down. And then specific to cat and dog food, you mentioned positive unit comps. What about sales comps? And how are you seeing the consumer respond to inflation broadly in that category? Seth Estep : Hi, Seth, this is Seth. Relative to our companion animal business, we remain very excited about the opportunity that we have in companion animal and we've continued over the years to manage through multiple cycles and have a track record of this. What I'd say like relative to comp, companion animal continues to be a comp driver for us in both units as well as top line. When you look at trends in the industry, approximately for our customers, approximately 75% of our customers own a pet, and about half of those that own more than one pet. And so just structural to our customer base in general, it's an area that we are highly committed to. We believe you think about like our convenient locations, our team members, our omnichannel capabilities, our robust and differentiated assortments. We see those as all competitive advantages in the pet space, and we continue to take market share there. And we believe we have substantial market share opportunities ahead, both in 2024 and beyond with our existing customer base, as well as the new customers that are out there. So companion animal in general for us, it remains a healthy business, and it's something that we were confident in taking share in the years to come. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to touch base on deflation, Kurt, you said modest deflation. I'm wondering if you could actually just quantify that if we think if it's like down 1% as comp headwind, and then bigger picture, there are some concerns that deflation will take you guys back to the back half of like 2015 to 2017 where comps were sluggish for a longer period of time. Do you see any key differences from the economic backdrop today versus several years ago when we last saw deflation? Kurt Barton : Yeah. Peter, I'll start with your first part of your question in regards to what our assumption is on a neutral deflation. Roughly neutral deflation for the year overall is what we see, give or take, I mean, give or take in our ranges, plus or minus one impact on retail AURs. As Hal mentioned, I think, in one of the other questions earlier, as we've rolled back off the peaks of 2022 throughout 2023 on a lot of the commodity deflation. A vast majority of that occurred throughout 2023 during these cycles. And these are fast turning SKUs in feed and food. So these -- these prices are already in our retail prices. First half of the year may have some exposure as a year-over-year lap on that. As we had slight net deflation in Q4, there could be and assumed in our guidance, some slight in the first half of the year. The second half of the year could be neutral or actually slightly positive. So we've considered each of those scenarios, but we really don't see a wide range in there. And I demonstrated that in regards to like corn, where it's 35% below the highs of 2022, and that happened throughout 2023. There's 10 or 15 points of difference between the pre-pandemic levels. And so there's really not much movement left in a commodity, and that commodity is a small percent ingredient in a small or a portion of our products that we offer. In comparison to 2015, it's all about what's structural. In 2015, we were coming off of years where oil prices, steel prices, grains were coming off of highs, and they completely flipped. In this case, the commodities hit the early peaks in 2021 and 2022 and all the structural nature, which is a bigger portion, such as wage rates, operating cost, et cetera, are really begin to get embedded in 2022 and 2023. And this structural. So I think it's a very different scenario. And there's limited risk that we see, if anything, it's a small level, and we believe adequately considered in our guidance. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisor Group. Your line is now open. Joe Feldman : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on something you said about big ticket. And you talked about you think big ticket should be positive in 2024. I was just curious, is that lapping in just the easier comparisons? Or is it more to do with your view that discretionary spending will pick up, consumer behavior will kind of shift towards that discretion bigger ticket category. Like what's driving, I guess, that confidence in having said that. Thanks. Kurt Barton : Joe, this is Kurt. I'll quickly just affirm what our -- was assumed in our guidance and then let Seth give you the answer about why we're assuming that for 2024. But we do believe that big ticket should be in line with our overall guidance range for the year. That's as you see that, that's relatively flattish at the midpoint to slightly favorable. And we're going up against two consecutive years of negative big ticket comps. So it has a lot to do about the compares. And in 2022, we were coming off of all of the stimulus spending in 2023. There's a bit of a swing off of durable goods into services and some of the weather-related pressures. And in 2024, we're cycling that and we've got some great offers, some new innovations that I know Seth can speak to. Seth Estep : Yeah. Thanks, Kurt. Yeah, so as Hal mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've got a lot of newness and innovation coming, particularly in our big ticket categories, also as we lap some of the easier compares that Kurt just mentioned, whether it be the Toro havoc that's going to be exclusive to us that Hal mentioned, a whole new grill lineup that we continue to expand basically an exclusive lineup of trailers to Tractor Supply, where we are definitely a destination, safe. As we look ahead, we believe can be a driver for us and then finally, I'd just say as the team and as we mentioned in prepared remarks, our private label credit card that we've been able to lean into to drive some volume as it comes to big ticket has also been strong. Hal Lawton : Broad-based, I'd just say, retail, in general, is rebounding some of the big ticket, and we could definitely see that as we approach kind of November and December. Mary Winn Pilkington : Allisa, we'll take one more question. Time limit. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Michael Baker : Okay. Thanks. Can you guys hear me? Kurt Barton : Yes. Michael Baker : Hello? Kurt Barton : Yes, Michael. Michael Baker : I hate to ask the last question on a real short-term thing. But I am curious about the first quarter. You said, you expect all quarters to be within your range or consistent with the range or something along those lines. So that would mean at the high-end. And you said positive for 1Q, but that would mean about 1%. Is that reflective of what you're seeing in January? Or how much does that consider? I think the comparison gets a little bit harder in February, although I don't think March was very good last year either. So with all the weather we're all seeing in the country, I think a lot of people are assuming that January is a pretty strong month. I guess I'm just trying to gauge how strong relative to the implied guidance of maybe up 1%? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Hey, Michael, it's Hal. Thanks for the question. I'd just say it's certainly, we saw some benefit from the weather in the first three weeks of January, really the second and third week, but January is our smallest month of the year, smallest month of the quarter. And the thing that the month that's really going to determine our comps for Q1 is going to be March. We are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, very excited about our spring setup this year. We've got our most innovation in the last three or four years now that kind of the supply chain disruptions and all those things have been worked through. Our vendors have been able to really spend the last year getting their innovation pipeline restarted. Our in-stock rates and our spring sets are back to the expected 95% plus that we historically have set at, and we feel great about spring. We're optimistic about Q1, as Kurt said, we're certainly expecting a positive comp. We're off to a good start with the month of January behind us. But really, the most important thing that we're focused on is having a win in March. Mary Winn Pilkington : Great. Well, Alissa, thank you. That will conclude our Q&A session. And I'm the Randall Day [ph], for anybody, please reach out for follow-up, and we look forward to talking to you on our Q1 earnings call at the end of April. Thank you.

Harry Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 is off to a solid start with first quarter results in line with our expectations. I would like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. As evidenced by our continuation of record high customer satisfaction scores, the team is always there for our customers as the dependable supplier [ for ] life out here. Before I get into our review of the first quarter's results, I want to take a moment to share what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business. In our view, the U.S. economy remains strong. Unemployment continues at a low level, wages are growing at a steady clip. In spite of sticky inflation, consumer spending remains strong, and mobility has slowed as a consequence of a challenging housing market, with that said, we continue to see outsized population growth in rural markets. As it relates to consumer spending, the shift of spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. In the first 2 months of the calendar year, consumer services spending growth was nearly 7%, whereas consumer spending on goods growth was less than 1%. As a result, the mix of goods as a share of PCE are now only 100 basis points above their pre-COVID average. This progressive shift is in line with our expectations as we enter the year. Also, as expected, inflation has remained sticky by outsized increases in shelter, food, away from home, energy and insurance. As a consequence, consumers continue to be anxious about inflation, particularly the lower-income consumer. In the first quarter, our upper income consumer over-indexed in big ticket categories and recreational purchases compared to our lower income consumer, who is prioritizing their spend on needs. In our needs-based, consumable, usable and edible categories, we see very little difference in our performance by income cohort. Once again, our business is proving to be durable, stable and very consistent. Broadly speaking, in our economy, goods continue to disinflate and are generally running low single digits with some categories having moderate deflation. With the first quarter behind Tractor Supply, we have now successfully lapped our 2 most challenging compares due to the inflationary benefits that we had over the last 18 months that have substantially benefited our top line. We do not see additional downward deflationary pressures in the current environment. The transition from an inflationary cycle to a disinflationary cycle is playing out as we anticipated. In spite of a very challenging housing market, we continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. While rural migration trends have moderated from the recent peaks, rural America again gained population in 2023. This marks the fourth consecutive year of growth in rural population. It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price has ensured the rural migration trend is one that's here to stay for the time being. So with that, let's now turn to a review of the business for the first quarter. We grew net sales by 2.9%, with comparable store sales up 1.1% and diluted earnings per share up 10.9% to $1.83. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.3% offset by a small decline in average ticket of 0.2%. These results were very much in line with our expectations that we shared with you as we started the quarter and year. Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Total customer count grew mid-single digits with growth in active, new and reactivated customers as we invested in our Neighbor's Club program and customer service. Neighbor's Club continues to represent the majority of our sales. During the quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offering. As our points-based program enters its fourth year, it was appropriate for us to refresh our offering based on insights and customer feedback. The changes we made were all implemented with the goal to have customers receive rewards faster and to lower the spending required for tier qualifications. Our Neighbor's Club members have responded positively to these changes. For example, the new rewards redemption at a $2 and $5 level down from $10 is working as we designed and is driving greater customer engagement and trips for this cohort. The initial response from our customers on the collective changes has been very positive, and we're seeing increased spending across the board. In addition, we continue to improve relevancy to our members through more personalized offers and tailored incentives and experiences based on their interest and shopping patterns. With more than 34 million members, Neighbor's Club should continue to build our customers' loyalty and affinity for Tractor Supply as we go forward. Our customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs. This is an area where we have strategically invested in training, compensation, benefits, tools and technology to help elevate our customer service. This has garnered the attention of our customers, and I believe, helps strengthen our scores. The strength of our portfolio products and shopping missions was evident very much so in the first quarter. We had robust growth in our seasonal categories. Our consumable, usable and edible products performed in line with our chain average. Our performance this quarter was on top of the robust growth we've experienced over the last 4 years as our CUE customer trends remain strong as we continue to gain market share. Our customers were certainly in the mindset to prepare for spring as we had strong big ticket growth in the mid-single digits and strength in other early spring preparedness categories. Categories that performed below our comp sales growth were more in our discretionary businesses such as clothing and gifts and truck tool and hardware. In our pet food and livestock categories, we continue to grow our market share. In pet food, we've seen growth moderate as the category disinflates and pet ownership moderates. Our customers' shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated, so we offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across private and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes about 900 Pet Wash locations. Additionally, pet owners benefit from the one-stop shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular, from the cross purchasing synergy with animal and livestock feed. In animal and livestock feed, we offer exclusive brands like DuMORs and Producer's Pride, along with the national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more. We continue to innovate across our key categories of equine, cattle and poultry in trends like organic and snack. And we bring a unique retail experience in these categories with events like our annual spring Chick Days. This year, the event is on track to have strong results. We continue to see growth from existing customers who are building out and adding to their flock. Organic feed and our assortment of premium breeds continue to lead the category and growth. Tractor Supply is the destination for backyard poultry. Today, nearly 2/3 of our backyard chicken owners consider them to be pets, and our customers over-index the poultry ownership with nearly one in five customers having chickens. Stepping back, we have a market share of about 20% in bagged livestock feed, and we continue to take share, and we are consistently outperforming the market across our 2 categories. After nearly 2 years of pressure on our big ticket comps, we were pleased to see big ticket categories turn positive in the quarter. We experienced broad-based strength across seasonal categories, including zero-turn tractors, recreational vehicles and outdoor power equipment. Our digital sales returned to double-digit growth in the quarter with increases in visits and an improved conversion rate. Nearly 80% of our orders were whether picked up in store or fulfilled by a store. Almost 20% of our sales came through our mobile app. The team made excellent feature update such as New Express Checkout feature and the addition of estimated delivery times, and these have helped increase our conversion rate. This year, we're opening our tenth and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. The start-up of the distribution center is right on schedule as shipping will begin during June. Once again, we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service our stores all the while allowing us to reduce our freight cost. Our supply chain investments over the last 4 years have provided us with material structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in stem miles. We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and 4 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. As I shared last quarter, 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center. We're leveraging the change of seasons across the store front as the year shifts to spring. The team has come out of the gate strong to ensure we have a differentiated assortment and availability in time for the planting season. We now have nearly 500 Garden Centers across the chain. Based on our early read of spring, our expectation is that with more variety than ever and a grower network to support our Garden Centers, we should see the customer respond positively this multiyear growth driver. At Tractor Supply, we're grounded in our purpose as a company to serve life out here and our deep-rooted commitment to our mission and values. We believe in finding meaningful ways to support our core mission. Earlier this week, we issued our fifth annual stewards of Life Out Here Tear Sheet that highlights our Stewardship priorities and progress. For all of us at Tractor Supply, we are highly committed to preserving life out here for future generations. We are proud to share our progress towards our ambitious goals. In summary, we're relatively pleased with our start to the year. Customer trends are in line with our expectations. The team is executing very well. We're controlling our controllables and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me start by building on to Hal's comments about the quarter. Our first quarter performance was right down the middle when compared to our expectations on both the top line and the bottom line. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a very strong January as the month features some spans of brutal cold. While February was warmer than normal and relatively soft, the best way to view the winter season performance is to look at weather categories across January and February combined. And overall, we were pleased with our cold weather category performance. We comped positive in March in spite of a limited arrival of spring across our markets. Where this season had turned to spring, we were very pleased with how the business performed.  All geographic regions performed in a tight band for the quarter. Average unit retail was impacted by modest product deflation of about 1% in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the trends we are seeing in unit growth and the underlying share gains in categories where deflation has had an outsized impact to AUR. Our gross margin rate of 36% increased 50 basis points to last year. We were very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs, disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of our everyday low price strategy. We were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. Our first quarter SG&A expense rate, including depreciation and amortization, increased 16 basis points to 28.2%. This increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization as well as the modest deleverage of our fixed cost given the level of comparable store sales growth. The leverage from our distribution center productivity gains did partially offset the loss of fixed cost leverage. Excluding depreciation and amortization, SG&A was essentially flat as a percent of sales. This was better performance than we anticipated entering the year as there were approximately $5 million of expenses that we had planned to occur in the first quarter that we now anticipate incurring in the second quarter. From my perspective, the team did a great job controlling the controllables. Altogether, operating income increased 7%, with operating margin expansion of 34 basis points. Net income increased 8.2% and diluted EPS increased 10.9% to $1.83. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $118.8 million, returning $236.2 million of capital to shareholders. We also increased our dividend by 7%, marking our 15th consecutive year of growing our dividend. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a modest decrease of about 4% in average inventory per store. Lower freight costs was a contributor to the decrease in inventory dollars. Excluding freight in Orscheln, our comp inventory was up modestly in dollar value and units. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. In our commitment to be the dependable supplier for our customers' lifestyle, we are at the highest in-stock levels since pre-COVID. With strong annualized cash flows and improved working capital, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. As Hal mentioned, we are reiterating our guidance for 2024. We anticipate this year to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. We continue to expect full year sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and project comparable store sales to be in the range of down 1% to a positive 1.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see second quarter comp sales in line with our full year outlook. Given the trends in our comp sales, our outlook assumes that strength in big ticket and seasonal will continue. We are planning for a modest AUR pressure on CUE with positive unit trends. Our expectation is that select discretionary categories will remain under pressure. For the second quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in line with the first quarter from continued supply chain efficiencies and benefits from effective cost management, partially offset by the mix impact of growth in big ticket, which runs below the chain average. We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage from our planned investments, including the incremental cost for the opening of our new distribution center. As I mentioned earlier, there's approximately $5 million of shifting to the second quarter that we had initially anticipated in the first quarter, including staffing and training costs associated with the opening of the DC. As a result, we expect second quarter operating profit margin to be down slightly compared to prior year. As I shared when we initially provided guidance in February, there are a few factors that will impact operating margin in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to continue to benefit our results in the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. To sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.06 billion to $1.13 billion and diluted earnings per share of $9.85 to $10.50. With the majority of the year still ahead of us, we believe these expectations are still appropriate. We continue to believe that the best way to look at our business is not by the quarters, but by the halves of the year. In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal for some final remarks. Harry Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. Our Life Out Here strategic priorities are on track and delivering on our expectations. We continue to see fantastic opportunities for growth ahead. In store and online, we're ready for the spring and summer season. Customers are responding positively to our new product assortments from Weber, Toro, YETI and more. We have several product test and learn initiatives in store and online, like Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer. Across companion animal, we're adding to our assortment with new brands like ACANA, Real Mesa and Native Pet and expanding our offerings across brands like Purina Pro Plan, SPORTMiX and Hill's Science Diet. Our Garden Centers are set to help our customers prepare for their hobbies of gardening, especially with a focus on vegetables and fruit trees and just simply enjoying their property. Across the seasons, we have new product offerings specific to the Garden Center. We're currently showcasing our roses, Plant of the Month, and are prepared with hanging baskets for Mother's Day. As we move into the second half of the year, we will shift to Fall Harvest and Halloween and then to Christmas with live goods and decor. Overall, this is a great way for us to track new customers and soften the front of our store. Across the store, we have a tremendous amount of newness for our customers' passions and lifestyles. We also continue to invest in customer service at our stores. In addition to our Hey GURA app, to turbocharge service our store team members provide to our customers, we are leveraging AI in our stores and Garden Centers through our Tractor Vision, which uses cameras and computer vision technology to provide data to deploy alerts that help our team members efficiently and effectively staff the store. One scenario where this is incredibly beneficial is when customer traffic is building up at our registers, Tractor Vision will alert team members through their ERP that another team member needs to come up to open another register. We're also leveraging Tractor Vision to monitor our front apron of the store for dwell time. This allows for a team member to better serve our customers particularly in categories like outdoor riding lawn mowers. These are the types of investments and capabilities that separate us from our farm and ranch competition and really make us a leader in retail. It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation goes out to the team for their dedication to delivering our mission and values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Seth Sigman : I wanted to talk about the big ticket improvement. Obviously, that's a nice change from what we've seen. If I recall, when you talk about big ticket, you're looking at transactions over a certain size. Can you try to separate for us the difference between sales from high price point products, so you mentioned riding lawn mowers. Have you actually seen comps in those specific high-ticket categories go positive? Or is it more basket building, you're seeing the benefit from more units per transaction as part of the spring activity? Harry Lawton : Seth, thanks for the question. We were very pleased with our big ticket performance in Q1. I'll highlight 2 trends and then provide some examples in the context of each of those. The first one I'll highlight was in January, where we had the nice cold weather come through the country. And as a consequence of that, had some nice big ticket sales that go along with that as we often do, whether that's things like snow throwers or log splitters. And to your point, the cutoff that we use for big ticket is $350 price point. . But then the other comment I'll make is in the month of March, particularly the last couple of weeks where we start to see that spring ramp occur, we saw a nice lift in big ticket over those weeks. And we did highlight in the prepared remarks in categories like riding lawn mowers, outdoor power, we saw strong positive comps in those categories in those weeks. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we saw an over penetration in those purchases of higher income consumers versus lower income consumers.  As we talked about, just kind of buying a bit more towards need for the lower income consumers. The last thing I'll add is that the trend on big ticket that we saw in March for spring sales has continued into Q2. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My question is also on big ticket, and Hal maybe I can put it in this way, if you look at it relative to 2019, and I think we're trying to assess whether there's like a bottoming and a turn that's happening versus seasonal. I think your comments around the March volume sounds like there may be a turn. But if we compare it to 2019 or 2020, granted it's hard to understand what baseline is normal versus not, but looking at it that perspective, and then -- and if there's anything about these big ticket trends that informs you about the cadence of the year. It doesn't sound like it, and it sounds like the cadence has always been pretty static across the quarters, but anything that you think about maybe big ticket strength continuing into the second half that maybe you didn't plan for? Harry Lawton : Simeon. I'll reiterate a couple of the comments that I have on the previous question, just to tee up the discussion. So on big ticket, as it relates to spring, we saw nice big ticket ramp in absolute dollars and comps as we exited Q1 and those trends have continued into Q2, and we're very pleased with our big ticket spring sales. As we look at a multiyear history on that, if you recall, last year, we commented that our big ticket categories were back to 2019 levels. So I would articulate the growth that we're seeing now is kind of consistent and growth that would be on top of a normal -- go back to 2019 trend. So we feel like it's a healthy growth, compounding growth and very much in the kind of stable on top of 2019 levels. The final thing I'll add is we called out numerous times, the drought conditions and the heat conditions that occurred in a number of our key markets the last 2 years, whether that's the Midwest or Texas, given the cooler weather that we've had and the nice precipitation we've had, grass is green across the country right now. And we all just returned from our executive walks across the whole country last week, and we all came back and kind of talked about the same thing. You've got really green grass, and it's growing well and the temperatures are staying cool. So the conditions are right for big ticket sales as well for us. But we're very pleased with the big ticket activity, strong exit in Q1 and continuing that pace into Q2, healthy on top of 2019 and the conditions are favorable for it as well this year. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham : I'm just trying to understand your inflation and deflation outlook a little bit more as we see a rise in oil prices here, do you think that could lead to any material inflation as we move through the year? Harry Lawton : Seth, good morning. As it relates to inflation, the -- probably the most important point to take away from us is that we've lapped our 2 most difficult quarters as it relates to comping on top of inflation. As we remarked at the end of our Q4 call, we were lapping 11% inflation from Q3 of 2022. And then we're lapping substantial inflation from last year in Q1 of 2023. So as we look ahead, we have significantly less lapping issues. And, in particular, as it relates to things like animal feed, as we get towards the end of Q2, we really start to get back to a more normalized environment. And by the way, by the time we get to mid-Q3, we're in -- we basically lapped it all. So I feel really good as we look forward that we're kind of getting close to hitting the bottom on disinflation and starting to be back as we get towards the end of the year towards a more normal outlook. We're not seeing anything different in our margin expectations, pricing expectations, cost to good expectations that we saw at the beginning of the year. As we've mentioned, we worked closely with our vendor partners middle of last year to pull back on a lot of the cost increases we've seen. That's been successful. You see that in our gross margin rate results. At the same time, we're appropriately moderated on prices. Our pricing has never been sharper in the industry. We monitor that very closely, and we've got multi, multiyear trends on that, never been sharper than we had in Q1 and coming into Q2. And we don't see anything on the horizon that would change kind of our retail price, cost of goods outlook. We did just complete all of our container, kind of shipping negotiations. Those are basically coming in kind of flat to last year. So there's not -- we don't see headwind in the future there. And I don't think that there's been a significant amount of oil, fuel kind of cost type increases to impact certainly -- first cost type at this point at all. And the freight market, given the status of the freight market and the overcapacity that there is, you had to start to see prices come up to reflect fuel in that area as well. So pretty stable, no real change to our outlook, either on this call or versus our last call. Kurt Barton : Yes. And Seth, this is Kurt. Just to tie that back to our guidance. As we entered 2024, I have said that we could see and are planning for 2024 from an inflation, deflation, relatively neutral, plus or minus a point. And we expect as we're starting to lap some of those inflation quarters last year, Q2 may have a similar impact as we saw in Q1. But then if you were to play out the current environment today, it would really put us in an expectation for the year sort of that neutral standpoint. And we'll know more on how the back half looks after Q2, but still pretty much playing right in line with our guidance. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : I wanted to expand on the big ticket commentary and focus on what's happening with spring. Can you contrast what you saw in March in markets where spring broke? Where did it break? Where it hasn't yet broken? And how you're thinking about what's April telling you about the business so far in the quarter? Harry Lawton : Yes. Chris, we think where the sun has been out and conditions have been right, we've been very pleased with spring. Our big ticket sales are strong, our Live Goods are selling well. Our Garden Centers are performing, categories like grilling, other categories like fertilizer and grass seed, we're seeing real strength across the board when the sun is -- where the sun is out and conditions are right. Interestingly, in the first half -- in the first quarter, conditions were stronger, really more in the Northeast and the Midwest, as there was a decent bit of cloudiness and precipitation through the Southeast and over into Texas throughout the back of the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And that's, interestingly, kind of continue to bid into the second quarter. But we feel very optimistic about the southern markets. They always turn in spring. And, you know, it's beautiful in Nashville today. But very pleased with our spring performance as we've headed into Q2 here. And we see Q2 really very similar to Q1, just right down the middle of a fair way. We expect Q2 to be very similar to Q1. And with the one notable call-up that Kurt had around, we think it's the bottom quarter for us on disinflation as it relates to CUE. But otherwise, it's kind of a streak down the middle, very similar quarter to Q1. And as I said, we're very optimistic and pleased with our spring start. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Steven Forbes : I think you noted 34 million members in the program, which is surprised to the upside here a little bit, at least as per our expectations. So I was wondering if you could maybe expand on the changes you made to the program. Is there anything sort of notable in terms of acquisition, maybe converting those non-Neighbor's Club members into members or repeat or retention trends that changed how you're thinking about that program membership evolving over time? And in any way to sort of size up what the true opportunity is for the 20% of sales that are coming from non-members today? Harry Lawton : We're very pleased with the continued progress we're making in our Neighbor's Club platform. And clearly, our customers are engaging in it and using it, finding value in it and it's a key retention driver and behavior driver for our business. And it's certainly become an integral part of how we go to market and a key area of competitive advantage for us. This quarter, we were pleased with the number of customers that we added to the Neighbor's Club platform. I called out that we had new customer growth in the quarter. And that was, new customers are a key driver to Neighbor's Club program growth. We're very pleased to have a positive new customer counts in the quarter. The second thing I'll call out as to your point, we made adjustments to our membership program to allow for a lower dollar increments to be redeemed in terms of points, both $2 and $5. We also modified our tier structure a bit to allow people to earn more dollars sooner. And the entire goal of that was to drive that opening tier and that behavior to get them more engaged as we talked about on these calls over the last 2 or 3 years, the best performance we've seen has been in our Preferred Plus tier. Second best performance had been in our Preferred tier. And our basic Neighbor's Club tier was really where we wanted to regalvanize that group, reenergize that group. And the changes we made, we saw a significant response to, and we're very pleased. And we've got a number of things on the horizon that will continue to help us grow that program. As we called out at the beginning of the year, we've got a Heroes program that we'll be rolling out towards the end of the second quarter or beginning of the third quarter, right around July 4 time frame. We'll share more about those details on our next call, but that's a lot -- that's going to allow us to embrace another set of customers that we have, provide them incremental value, and we're excited about that. We've gotten great feedback from the customers that we've tested that with. And we're also in the process of implementing a customer data platform that's going to allow us to significantly improve our personalization and that's time for implementation in the back end -- back half of the year. And that's going to allow us to just take our personalization, capabilities and our targeting capabilities to the next level, in which we already do an excellent job. I'd say market-leading job on that, but this just keeps the improvement there. So great performance in Neighbor's Club in the quarter, new features being launched already that are going to keep driving that. And then we've got a number of new things on the horizon. And as I said, this is a distinct part of Tractor Supply and an area of competitive advantage for us. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Steven Zaccone : I wanted to ask on gross margin. So given the guidance for the second quarter that it should be similar in terms of expansion. Can you just talk through the back half of the year because you start to face some tougher comparisons. Just talk through some of the expectations in the back half? Kurt Barton : Yes, Steven, this is Kurt. The gross margin drivers are very similar throughout the year, but yet, as I mentioned in some of my remarks, it has a bit of a difference in impact by quarter. So our biggest opportunity and biggest growth driver in gross margin will be, throughout the year, our transportation and freight. And in transportation and freight, it's both transitory or rate-related, where we are coming off of those higher costs, particularly in the ocean freight, but also the more sustainable is the structural where the new improvements in the supply chain, the distribution centers are driving down our stem miles. And even as we open up our tenth distribution center, we'll reoptimize the lanes and reduce stem miles, be able to optimize by finding the lowest better rates, and that happened with our Navarre, Ohio DC last year. So those -- that will be the biggest driver. We'll start to lap in Q3, and heavily in Q4, some of the rate-related benefits. So it will begin to moderate on that aspect. But then on the other aspect of that is our cost management on our products. And there's really been a very disciplined strategic approach towards that, that began last year, but really, we started to see the benefit modestly in Q4. And our merchants and our vendors really partner together to drive down some of that cost. And we're actually even creating some of that AUR deflation so that in our CUE categories, our key drivers, we're able to offer the best value and even better gross margin rate. And that's some of what the pressure that I mentioned on AUR is that we feel very confident that we're bringing the best prices in our categories, regardless of competition, and that's what's helping to really gain the market share. So for the back half of the year, transportation, cost management and lower cost drivers will contribute. And then in the second half, the third item that will begin will be the supply chain benefits from the new distribution center. As the transportation costs are the highest one, that's why we've said the second half may be a slightly lower gross margin growth in the first half as we start to cycle it. But it's really been the main 3 things that will benefit throughout the year, but just beginning to less of a benefit on the transportation side in the second half. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Can you give us a sense for how the pet food category has been performing as of late? Have you been surprised that there's been general softness in these trends? And how has Tractor Supply's market share compared this quarter to the last couple of quarters, especially as it seems like the company has been taking more aggressive steps whether it's price investments, kinks to the loyalty program. And then finally, there's been a lot of parsing of your words on quarter-to-date trends. Can you give us an explicit indication of what's been happening quarter-to-date, so we can understand if you have to see an acceleration from here in order to get to that down the fairway commentary about the second quarter? Harry Lawton : Michael, I'll comment first on pet. First off, I'll just step back on pet and say it's an incredibly attractive market. It's one that outperformed kind of the broader retail market for decades. It's been a long-term source of growth for us. And I think that the slowdown in that industry this year has been well documented, with that slowdown being driven really by 2 macro drivers. The first is moderation in pet ownership. And the second is stagnant pricing, right? That's an industry that's historically been able to claw 2 or 3 points of price increase every year, given the substantial price increases that have occurred in that category over the last 2 years, basically, that category is flat in pricing for the year.  So you've got some moderation in the category just for this year. We have an incredibly distinct value proposition in that category. Our value proposition includes, I think, importantly, the co-mingling of purchases with animal feed. 88% of our customers have animals and pets. The vast majority has both. So they appreciate being able to shop for both their animal and pet food at the same time. We complement that key kind of portfolio advantage obviously, with customer service, with a pet-friendly environment now having over 900 pet washes, which by the way, we see nearly 50,000 pets a week in our stores, with pet washes, pet clinics, et cetera. And that's true, just animals in our store. So we have a very distinct value proposition. We had all -- kind of publicly available brands, the international brands, but we also have 2 very leading private label brands. We cover the range of assortments. So incredible value proposition there, one that's distinct and I think in particular one that really holds up well in this market, given the various competitive dynamics that are going on, and as I said, but I want to reinforce, we are absolutely still taking share in that category, albeit at a lower growth rate because of the moderation in the category, but we are absolutely still taking share in that category, and we're only doing things to reinvest and lean in further to continue to capture that share. And as we look forward, we fully expect that pet will continue to be a long-term growth category for us and a driver of our overall growth. As it relates to Q2, as I said, we expect it to be another just straight down the fairway quarter for us. We don't need meaningful acceleration to use your words to deliver that performance for the quarter. One of the things I already highlighted is that the last quarter of real material disinflation, particularly in animal feeds. So it would be great to have that behind us and our outlook takes that into consideration. And if anything, I think there could be some modest upside as we look ahead, if you look at our quarterly comps last year, we had mid-single-digit comps in the month of April and May and then basically dropped off to a flat comp in the month of June. We can all recall June last year, it went immediately hot and you had the Canadian forest fires. Our outlook does not count on that performance improvement, but it's an opportunity should we get the right conditions for that month. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : I know it's still a, somewhat, limited data set, but you talked about seeing good results from your Garden Centers where spring has broken. I know you guys have previously provided a framework for what you expect to happen. But can you provide any kind of real-time updates in terms of what you're seeing on actual results? Harry Lawton : Two things on that. So we've gotten so much better at sorting our Garden Centers, staffing our Garden Centers, putting technology at play to drive our Garden Centers would encourage everyone on the call, if you hadn't had a chance to go visit one of our Garden Centers in the spring to do so. We've got things this year like our Plant of the Month, as I mentioned on the call, which are Knockout Roses right now. We're deploying our Tractor Vision software into all the Garden Center stores to optimize and improve customer service. Our grower network now that we're in year 3 in many of these stores are now really lined up to produce tailored product for us. And we're seeing those results in our live goods sales broadly across our -- the country [ for us ], even in areas where conditions have been ideal, we're seeing good results there. .  The team is doing things like, for Easter this year, for the first time, we brought any kind of in and out. We bought over 100,000 bulbs for Easter with a real nice packaging around and blew those things down. It just gives us even more confidence that we can execute in those sorts of ways. And so very pleased with our live goods and our Garden Center performance. In addition to the live goods piece, which was about half of the lift that we're looking for. We also, this year, have gotten much better at what goes outside in our, like, Garden Centers versus what goes inside, you'll see all of our pots assortment out there this year. You'll see organic soils closely, cross-merchandise besides our fruit and vegetables this year. You'll see soil and mulches lined up in our side lots to be able to facilitate drive-through and load up there. So we really got those things prime this year. And then as we look towards the back half, this year, you'll see us have much more expansive programs and things like harvest, and that's really blowing that out this year with mums pumpkin, a harvest product, Halloween product building a real kind of harvest destination in our Garden Centers. And then similarly, you'll see Winter Wonderland really brought to life this year like we've not yet done for Christmas. So really excited about our Garden Center performance in the current spring period, but also as we look forward to the plans that we have, the team is doing an excellent job across all functions, really lining us up like -- as an example, on that Easter program, we shipped that to our DCs. It was the first time we ran plants through our DC. So a lot of learnings and a lot of continued execution there. Scot Ciccarelli : Is there a way to quantify the comp lift, though, Hal? Harry Lawton : Yes. So as we exit Q2, we'll have a much better sense of that, as you all will certainly recall, our -- over the last year, we said our Garden Centers were not performing at our expectations, because of the suboptimal spring conditions that we operated in last year, but that we had high expectations for this year, noted it is the year of the Garden Center, we're performing at those expectations. But again, 6, 7 weeks into spring with another 6, 7, 8 strong weeks to go. So more to come on that. But I think the short answer, I would say is they're performing at our expectations kind of season-to-date. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Just curious, I believe the Orscheln stores are earning the comp base in the second quarter. Just curious how we should think about that? Anything that those stores are cycling from a year ago standpoint that we need to think about? And kind of related to that or maybe a little unrelated, I was curious if Seth would talk a little more about some of the merchandising, innovation, newness that's in the store and maybe what he's most excited about as we look out over the balance of the year? Kurt Barton : Yes, Peter, this is Kurt. I'll start with your first part of your question and then hand it over to Seth to address the back end part of it. Orscheln is running right in line with our expectation. The first quarter, for instance, is still lapping a lot of the liquidation in Orscheln. And then in second quarter, as we transition, you begin to get outside of a lot of that liquidation. So as we converted into our point of sale, it's somewhat in line with the time frame of having all of the Tractor Supply inventory in the Tractor Supply system. So we begin to lap a more normal time frame, particularly in the back half of the year. The Orscheln stores are running in line with a lot of our Midwest performance. We're pleased with Orscheln. Again, as we said when we made the acquisition, such a great value proposition opportunity for us, and it's playing out well in that. Some of the things that we've done, we've got 81 stores that were sized very differently. We've been able to rightsize and put many of the stores right in line with the Tractor Supply, 15.5 square foot. We've got some larger ones that allow us to do some test in those. But for the bulk over the period of the last 12 months, we've been [indiscernible] go in rebrand, put the fusion in there and make sure that it fits the best Tractor Supply streamlined, efficient shopping experience there. The team is engaging and learning a lot of the Tractor, the optimized Tractor process. So across the board, very pleased with that. And Seth can be able to talk a little bit about some of the other aspects on the merchandising side with Orscheln. Seth Estep : Thanks, Peter, for the question. So I would just say, if we look out to the back half, I'd speak a little bit more broadly even outside of Orscheln, and even go back to kind of last quarter's call and how really talked about this being the most innovation that we've seen in our stores since the start of the pandemic with all the reset activity, newness, partnership with our supplier base, how their supply chains are kind of back to normal levels. A couple of things that I would highlight that we're really excited about. First, I would just say, we talked about the strength in big ticket right now and Hal talked a minute ago about Tractor and riders. I will tell you that exclusive lineup that we have, like in the Toro, Havoc is performing very well. We see that innovation really responding, again, a product built for our life out here. Some things that we don't speak much about when we think about garden itself. Like we just launched a comprehensive assortment of Groundwork soils and our exclusive brands that have been very strong. We just launched Weber. Very pleased with that start and how that's going. And then if you go to the back half, I would just say, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the newness coming in pet, but even things like [ Iconic Classics ] where we'll be the first brick-and-mortar here in the U.S. launching [ Iconic Classics ]. Real Mesa, which has been a strong new digital brand, will be the first brick-and-mortar launching Real Mesa in pet food, but it's really targeted to kind of our consumer in that approach. And then just the Garden Centers themselves and all the new activity that we have going throughout the course of the year and just lean into those activities and then [indiscernible]. We think about Orscheln Farm & Home, like some of the learnings that we're getting out of outdoor [indiscernible], you'll see us launch new programs there midyear, getting really towards that kind of hunting customer, and we believe that those will be some categories that we can take across the Tractor Supply stores from a regional perspective and some localization perspective to really drive some business. So again, just reiterate this kind of from 2024, lot of new innovation, a lot of newness and some most newness we've had over the past few years. Mary Pilkington : We've have maybe one more question just so that we're sure we end at the top of the [ board ] hour. Operator : Final question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Peter Keith : Nice results, by the way. So I wanted to kind of just ask around the broader economy. Housing remains quite sluggish. So how do you see the economic backdrop in general for the rural economies where you guys operate versus maybe the broader U.S. economy. We've been housing into that discussion would be helpful as well. I guess is rural outperforming? Or do you think performing more in line with the broader U.S.? Harry Lawton : Peter, thanks for the question. To start by the highest level, rural is very -- I think rural America is doing very well right now. We see our highest performance across our store base in rural America right now. If you look at the national statistics, you see net urban migration out -- kind of more migration coming out of cities than in. And you see that migration going to rural America. I think there's a variety of drivers for that, but that trend benefits us. Stepping back, as we acknowledged on our earnings call last quarter, we acknowledge 2024 would be a non-algo for us and that we look forward to getting back to our long-term algorithm as kind of economic conditions became more neutral for us. Most importantly, the two economic conditions that were most impacting us with the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the notion -- and kind of disinflation. Those two trends are playing out as we expected at the beginning of the year. As I commented, we're 100 basis points away from goods to services being at its pre-COVID levels. We've already traveled almost 400 basis points on that journey. So unclear where it will obviously stop, but you would say we're the vast majority of the way along on that journey. Disinflation, we've called out that. Q2 will be our bottom on that. And so we feel really good about that as well and that that's near behind us. And so the two major conditions that are affecting our business, you can see light at the end of the tunnel. As it relates to housing more broadly, as we called out, last quarter, we really don't see housing as a primary driver of our business. And I know there's been some conversation around [ hire ] for longer [ run rate ], and the impact that might have on the housing market and then any delay in how 2025 results may occur. And obviously, talking about 2025 results right now is very premature for us. But we don't see the [ hire ] for longer kind of notion impacting our business anywhere near to the degree that it impacts those that are very housing sensitive. Thanks, Peter, for the question. Mary Pilkington : All right, everyone, that will wrap up our call today. I'm around and we're available for calls. And if you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of our second quarter. So thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I appreciate your cooperation. We will be available after the call for follow-ups. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As always, I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000 plus Tractor Supply team members for their commitment to each other and our customers, and for their dedication to serving Life Out Here. And this quarter, I'd like to give a special shout out to our technology team, who did a tremendous job recovering our business from the CrowdStrike outage without a material impact. So let's start with the operating environment for our business before I discuss our second quarter results. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators that we all follow continue to be rather mixed for the consumer in the second quarter. While in-line with our expectations at the beginning of the year, I would characterize the health of the consumer as modestly more cautious than last quarter, but certainly still within the range of our forecast at the beginning of the year. Consumer spending on goods appears to be fatigue across income cohorts. While we've seen improvements in the consumer inflation rate, unemployment has ticked upwards to the highest rate since late 2021. Additionally, consumer sentiment and consumer confidence are both subdued and the consumer spending landscape continues to be rather choppy. Additionally, in the recent personal consumption expenditures report, we saw another soft month for goods. While in-line with our expectations, the ongoing shift in spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. The mix of goods as a share of PCE is still about 90 basis-points above the pre-COVID average. As it relates to retail sales for the second quarter, U.S. retail was flat to modestly positive with growth in non-durable categories, which was in-line with our performance as a company. And in the farm and ranch channel, we estimate that, that channel experienced mid-single-digit declines, which is indicative of our continued share gains in the channel. With that said, our business for the first half of 2024 has performed right down the middle of our guidance. For instance, half of the months of the year have had positive comp sales and our year-to-date comp sales are up about 0.2%. And overall, our profitability is also right in-line with our expectations and the team has continued to manage our business exceptionally well. As we look at our business in half and reflect back on the spring season, as we always talk about, weather can certainly shift sales between quarters. And given this year, the early Easter and then a couple of weeks of warm weather that we had there in late March, we estimate a potential pull-forward of $15 million to $20 million in sales from the first quarter -- from the second quarter into the first quarter. And so if you think about this kind of balances out our performance across the two quarters. And additionally, we thought we'd have some potential for an elongated spring, particularly in late June, but that did not materialize. On the customer front, of note, we did see our higher income customers moderate just modestly, as spending for vacation travel has surged for this group. And conversely though, our lower income customer cohort moderated up sequentially from the first quarter. And net-net, our overall customer base though continues to grow and be very strong. Now let's shift to some performance highlights for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.5% with a comparable-store sales decline of 0.5%. Diluted EPS was $3.93. Our comparable-store sales performance was driven by a modest transaction decline of 0.6% with our average ticket coming in at 0.1% positive. As we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in-line with our full year guidance. As we moved through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first quarter continued to play-out. Importantly, we continue to see healthy customer engagement. The investments we've made in Neighbor's Club our world-class loyalty program, are a competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in both customer counts and customer retention. If you recall, in the first quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offerings. The changes were implemented with the goal to have members receive rewards faster and lower the spending required for tier qualifications. This quarter, as part of our ongoing and continued improvements in the program, we launched Hometown Heroes, which recognizes military service members, veterans and first responders. And this program brings together under one banner our long standing support for the selfless men and women who serve America. A highlight of the program is that our Hometown Heroes received the highest level status and benefits of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And while still very early, we're pleased with the enrollment. Of note, about 20% of our Hometown Heroes to-date are new to Neighbor's Club and about 15% are new to Tractor Supply. Once again, our Neighbor's Club comp sales outpaced our overall sales growth. At the same time, we also reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and record membership of more than 36 million members, and that means we've added nearly 5 million members over the last 12 months. And our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. At the same time, though, we are seeing a slight disengagement of our non-core customers, is down just modestly. We believe this is attributable to the overall macro headwinds that I mentioned in my opening remarks. And given that this customer is not as highly engaged in the kind of Life Out Here lifestyle, our belief is that this customer cohort is a little sluggish or fatigued given the duration of inflation and higher cost of living since 2022, and just being judicious in their spend. And as we look forward, though, our Neighbor's Club is laser focused on this opportunity as we improve our personalization capabilities, particularly with our customer data platform that we'll be implementing later in the year. Our customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs, with improvements every week for more than 2.5 years. Customer service is a consistent differentiator for Tractor Supply, and our commitment to excellence in customer service and investments we've made in training, tools and technology are really paying off with our customer. And these efforts have also though received national recognition by various third-parties, including USA Today and Forbes. Also, it's worth noting that the team received a CIO 100 Award recently for our groundbreaking work to utilize AI to enhance the customer experience in our stores. Just a great job by everyone around on our customer service. Moving to category performance, a highlight was the strong positive comps in big ticket items in the second quarter, notably in categories like riding lawnmowers, recreational vehicles and sporting goods. And the commonality in these categories is strong innovation in newness and our customers really responded to this. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our live goods performance, which comps well above the chain average despite the hot weather that impacted many of our other seasonal categories. As we shared last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable and edible product would run modestly below the chain average in the second quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail. We once again grew units in these categories and we believe we're continuing to gain market share. The needs-based demand-driven nature of our product categories -- these product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business. Clicking down into our CUE categories. In pet food, recent industry data suggests that the overall category was flat to negative in Q2. As it relates to our business, we continue to take share, but we have seen growth continue to moderate as the category disinflates and pet ownership trends remain soft. Our customer shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated. We offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across national and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes more than 900 pet wash locations. Through the second quarter, we've had strong double-digit growth in our pet wash service. Additionally, the value of our mobile pet vet clinics is another great gateway for pet customers to find Tractor Supply. Year-to-date, we also have seen mid double-digit growth rates in visits to our clinics, offered across more than 1,600 stores. The two of these in combination with the rest of our services and product benefits creates a great opportunity to reinforce our value proposition. Additionally, pet ownerships benefit from the one-stop-shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular from the cross purchasing synergy with animal feeds. As we've mentioned, the vast majority of our customers have both an animal and a pet. In aqua livestock and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While our average unit retails were down mid-to-high single-digits in this category in Q2, conversely, we had strong mid-single-digit unit growth across all species. As large animal counts continue to pressure, we are certainly a share winner in the large animal categories with our strong unit growth. And in poultry, our annual Spring Chick Days was another positive highlight in the quarter. The event builds on our reputation as the destination for backyard enthusiasts. From economy to organic feed as well as our assortment of premium breeds, our lineup continues to resonate with our customers. Much like the first quarter, categories that performed below our comp sales were in our discretionary businesses, such as clothing, footwear and decor and also in the hardlines products of the business, such as things like ag, fencing and pet kennels. Our digital sales continued to trend from last quarter of double-digit growth. We've accelerated our digital capabilities and that's fueling engagement of our customers and also improving our conversion rate. Our 10th and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas opened during the second quarter. The startup of the distribution center was right on-schedule and shifting began last month. It's a great job by the team. Once again, we are capitalizing on the opportunity to realign with store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our store. Our supply chain investments over the last four years have provided us with a structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in spend miles. Our garden centers had strong performance during the important second quarter. We now have more than 500 garden centers across the chain. The merchants did a great job with a differentiated assortment and strong in-stocks on top of the planting season. With more variety and live goods as well as adjacent categories catering to outdoor living, we saw the customer respond positively to this multi-year growth driver. We opened 21 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply's in the quarter. Our new store productivity continues to perform very well. In the year since announcing our expanded real estate capabilities allowing for own development, we continue to anticipate material benefits to both revenue growth and operating margin rate. Our team has built-out capabilities to allow us to scale this initiative. We now have nearly 50% of our pipeline in own development with our first locations already open. This development allows us to have rent reductions of 15% or more compared to our traditional build-to-suit. And we continue to believe that we have a robust pipeline of low-risk organic growth opportunities ahead of us. To wrap-up, I believe the team is pleased but not satisfied with our first half performance. We set high expectations for ourselves. Customer trends are relatively in-line with our expectations. The team is executing well. In typical Tractor Supply fashion, we are effectively managing the factors that we can control and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. As we plan for the second half of the year, we anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as-is typical in an election year. At the halfway point of the year, we are narrowing our guidance for fiscal 2024 to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the second half of the year. We continue to create more separation between us and our competition, thanks to our team members and the meaningful relationships they have with our customers in combination with our strategic initiatives. Our dedication to serving Life Out Here remains unwavering. We will always strive to do the right thing. And now I'll turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. In many ways, our second quarter topline results were consistent with our results in the first quarter, with solid seasonal growth and exceptional big ticket sales, while our year around discretionary categories remain pressured. As we expected, CUE performance was slightly below the chain average given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing. Retail price deflation, which was just over 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our CUE categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in CUE as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter. Our comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain within a range of down 2% to up 2%. The strongest regional performance was in the Northeast and Commonwealth due to easier compares and better overall weather compared to last year. This strength was offset by pressure in the Far West and Texas, Oklahoma for the exact opposite reasons, as they had tougher compares and less than ideal weather conditions this quarter. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%. As Hal mentioned, we believe April was negatively impacted by the pull forward of Easter into the first quarter as well as a slow start to the spring season. Moving down our income statement, our gross margin increased 43 basis points to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an everyday low price strategy. These improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below chain average margins. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 58 basis points to 23.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation amortization, as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs given the decline in comparable store sales. These factors were partially offset by productivity improvements and strong cost-control. During the quarter, our ongoing sale leaseback strategy benefited SG&A by approximately $5 million net of transaction and repair costs from the sale of two Tractor Supply locations. This transaction and the related benefit represent timing shift out of the third quarter and into Q2. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 13.2%. We had strong cost control as evidenced by our underlying operating profit margin that was essentially flat with prior year. Diluted EPS was $3.93 compared to $3.83 last year. Turning now to our balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of 10.2% in average inventory per store as we improved our in-stock position in CUE and invested in big-ticket given its strength. Our in-stocks are up nearly four points to our best level since before the pandemic. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory as we enter the second half of the year. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around two times. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million of capital to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Given our performance in the first half of the year and our forecast for the balance of the year, we believe it's now appropriate to narrow our guidance range. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $15 billion with comp store sales in the range of down 0.5 point to up 1%. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 9.8% to 10.1% with net income of $1.08 billion to $1.12 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.40. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarter, let me share with you a bit more of how we are thinking about the various scenarios. We are approaching the back half with balanced optimism. We are forecasting comp sales in the third quarter to be within a tight band of scenarios and generally similar to the first half of the year. The shift of the season doesn't occur until late in the third quarter and we don't begin to lap the deflationary effect of feed until the fourth quarter. The only meaningful swing factor-in Q3 tends to be weather, particularly large storms, which produce emergency response activity. We see the fourth quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes. For our base case, we do anticipate stronger growth in the fourth quarter given the easier compares, while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending. On the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter, lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the potential for greater emergency response activity. Now on the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the Federal election and a shorter holiday selling season with five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. As for the retail price, our plans continue to reflect a headwind from deflation in the third quarter with a moderation towards neutral in the fourth quarter as we start to lap the lower cost, which began in late Q3 of last year. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. The third quarter is expected to have our best gross margin expansion as we anticipate transportation costs will remain favorable. In the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult comparison with 129 basis-points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiative. As a result, we are forecasting our fourth quarter gross margin rate consistent with the prior year. I view our gross margin performance as strong in this current environment. Moving on to SG&A, for the second half of the year, there are a couple of items I would highlight for our expectations, especially for the third quarter. First, please keep in mind that we are lapping last year's depreciation benefit of 35 basis points or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Second, given our comp sales outlook specific to the third quarter, we anticipate modest fixed cost deleverage. And third, we will continue to see pressure from the startup cost of the new distribution center in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. Thus our SG&A performance will be the softest in the third quarter with more modest deleverage in the fourth quarter. In total, we remain on track for the benefits of our sale leasebacks to be relatively consistent with last year's, albeit with a slight variation by quarter due to the timing shift of two stores into the second quarter. We continue to forecast the return of capital to shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term. At Tractor Supply, we believe in playing offense. This is a team that will stay on offense and continue to invest for the long term. We are excited about our Life Out Here strategy progress, our leadership position in the industry and our ability to build-on our track record of long term value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap up. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Despite the temporary softness in our channel, structural elements remain very attractive for Tractor Supply. We have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiative, our market being a beneficiary of continued net world migration, high return new store growth opportunities and ongoing share gains. Tractor Supply is extremely well positioned as a leader in a large fragmented market. Before we go into Q&A session, I'd like to wrap-up with three comments. One, as we head into the back half of the year, I am very excited about our robust innovation pipeline, the compelling values we have in our market and our new brand launches. We just set our annual Deer event and Halloween Decor program and both are off to a strong start. In Pet, we have a number of upcoming activities, including our expanded Pet Appreciation Month, a new lineup for MuttNation by Miranda Lambert and an expansion of 4health, our exclusive brand premium dog food. Additionally, we have an exciting new endcap program as well as new center court and dry wall events that are focused on compelling value that are core to our lifestyle. The second comment I'd have is we continue to believe that as and when economic conditions become more neutral for us that we will return to our long term algorithm. As mentioned, there's really two economic conditions that are impacting us the most. The first is the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the second is deflation. We believe both of these are transitory. We don't need them to improve, but rather just to normalize for us to return to our long term algorithm. And the third comment is that the team is playing offence. And we're not only executing our existing initiative, but working -- we're working on plans for the back-half of the decade and working on our next growth drivers of our Life Out Here strategy. Tractor Supply does not lack for opportunities and we believe we have multiple new opportunities that can expand on our $180 billion total addressable market. I'm very excited to share more details of the next drivers of our strategy in the near future. Our stores and online are ready for the changes of season as we enter the third quarter. Tractor Supply is well prepared to meet the needs and expectations of our customer. We've invested in our store base, in inventory, in our supply chain, in our digital capabilities and customer service to ensure that we can deliver on on-promise of providing the best products and solutions for Life Out Here. We've also enhanced our Neighbor's Club to provide more benefits and rewards to our loyal customers. We're excited about the upcoming events and promotions that will showcase our unique and differentiated seasonal assortment of merchandise, and we expect to see continued improvements across our categories. To conclude, I'm incredibly proud of our team. Throughout our 85-plus year history, no matter what issue we face, our team members have always come together. We have a unique and special culture. It's our special soft and key differentiator, and it's what gives me great confidence in the future of Tractor Supply. And with that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys, Scot Ciccarelli. Historically, when we've had a pretty wet spring, which I think is pretty fair to assume across most of the country, you guys have had a very extended selling season. So do you expect that to be the case for the balance of the year? And then secondly, you mentioned that you're expecting roughly flat, let's call it, comps in the third quarter. Are you currently tracking in line with that or is that just kind of the bogey for the end-of-the quarter? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Hi, Scot, good morning. To your first question on the wet spring, it was a -- in the normally west spring, particularly in the South -- in the Southwest, Texas, in particular was wet almost the entire quarter. We had hoped that might lead to an elongated spring, particularly in the month of June and into July, it actually be favorable for us given comparison to last year. That's not how it played out. As we all know, the month of June was one of the hottest, if not the hottest month on record ever. And so we went from pretty much a wet -- wet spring to an immediately hot summer. And we did not see, as we called out ag fencing as an example, that's a big category, for us in general and in particularly in Texas. And as an example, we did not see that category recover in June like we had some aspirations for. That said, it's a wet week this week and we are hopeful that, that can pay some dividends as we turn the corner into August and into the fall. And as it relates to Q3, yes, it's basically kind of right down the middle of fairway for us in terms of our guidance range and kind of consistent with the comments Kurt gave at this point. And the one thing I would call out is July is our toughest compares of the three months. It's -- we get sequentially -- sequentially easier and compares to the tune of like a point or two points each of the next two months. So anyway, thanks, Scott, for the question. Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Hal Lawton : Hi, Michael. Michael Lasser : Number one - Hi, Hal. Hi, can you walk us through the thought process on just the changes you've made recently. Do you see any customer impact from some of the social media chatter and how did it impact your same store sales? Thank you so much. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hi, Michael, and thanks for the question. I'd start out by saying, obviously, it was a difficult situation that played out in a public arena, that's unfortunately is becoming increasingly common in business and the divisive sentiment that we have in our country. And we've got over 50,000 team members and 30-plus million customers and we certainly heard a range of feedback. We learned from others who had gone before us on this and moved fast to try to remove the perceived political and social agendas from our policies. And all that said, we have no evidence that it had a measurable impact on our business. And we continue to look to monitor the situation and look at a variety of datasets, but we do have no evidence at this point that it's had a measurable impact on our business and our results. And if I just step-back, we have a very special culture at Tractor Supply. It's firmly grounded in our well-established mission and values. And while we did withdraw our carbon emissions goals and retired our D&I goals, we did not retire our commitment to treating people fairly with respect, to inclusion, to being a good corporate citizen and certainly not to be stewards of -- and certainly did not retire -- are committed to being stewards of Life Out Here. And Tractor Supply, again, credible culture. We never lose sight of our obligations to be great stewards of our business over the long term. Thanks. Thanks, Michael, for the question. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Steven Zaccone : Great. Good morning. Thanks, -- great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the same-store sales trend. And I was curious if we could talk through the guidance adjustment a bit more. I guess, specifically on the second half because you leave open the option that you could still have negative same-store sales in the back half, even though the compares look a little bit easier. So has anything really changed from a ticket perspective, maybe deflation lasting a little bit longer than you expected? And then from a transaction perspective, do you have the view that the pet food landscape is just softening a little bit more than you expected? So maybe that side of the business is also coming a little bit weaker? Thanks very much. Hal Lawton : Yes, Hi, Steven. Let's start out by saying the first half played out very much in-line kind of right down the middle of our kind of base-case center point of our guidance. I would say most things in the first half were very much in-line with our expectations. I mean, maybe big ticket was a little stronger, and maybe some of the things like ag fencing and dog containment and such were a little bit weaker. But everything else, I would say, animal feed, pet food, our CUE products in general, seasonal. Even the discretionary business, we expected them to be reasonably negative. All those played out very much in line with what we expected. I kind of think about it as a down the middle of fairway based on our expectations first half. As it relates to the second half, we have a similar thesis to the second half right down the middle of fairway. I think Kurt tried to call that out in the prepared remarks. Q3, I think would be much of the continuation of the first half of the year with Q4 being really where there's a higher rate -- a broader range of outcomes. I think Kurt tried to really bring that to life in his prepared remarks to say there's one version of Q4 that could be -- could be strong and start that trend back towards our long term algorithm and there's a some favorable compares there and -- which create a nice setup and we've got a number of activities also going into that -- into the market during that time. On the flip side, there is a kind of a kind of more unfavorable potential outcome in Q4, where if we didn't see some good winter weather and the federal election created a lot of distraction and you've got a shorter holiday season that could lead to a lesser performance in Q4. So really tried to lay out the range of those two, and that's really what drives the Q4 variation, is really what drives the -- really the range of our comp guidance for the balance of the year with a pretty tight range of outcome forecast in Q3. But I would say from the start of the year, the business is really right in the middle of what we expected it could be. And to your kind of kind of question at the end, there's really sitting at this point in time, nothing that we see in the back half that's much different than what we saw at the beginning of the year. It's a pretty, pretty straightforward at this point in terms of our outlook. Steven Zaccone : Okay. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Peter Benedict : Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt, I know you addressed inventory briefly during the prepared remarks that you felt comfortable. Can you maybe give us a little more color on the build that you saw in the second quarter and maybe where you would have us expecting inventories to kind of level out over the balance of the year, and why you don't think there's -- you don't have too much? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes, I'll actually let Seth -- Peter give you more of the details on that, and I'll make one reference. We are cycling last year. In Q2, we called out that we were down 1.7% in inventory last year. We knew we needed and wanted more inventory in CUE and even some of the big ticket rec. And so we're very pleased with where we're at. And I think, Seth, why don't you explain further some of where the-- Seth Estep : Yes. Kurt Barton : --increase is at and the position on inventory for today and even the back half. Seth Estep : Hi, Peter, Seth. Thanks, Kurt. Yes, as Kurt mentioned, we were down last year about 1.7%. When we think about this year's inventory position, we have purposely invested in where we're continuing to see growth. So when you look right now, we're continuing to invest in areas like grills, mini bikes, rec vehicles, even like riders where we're continuing to see some strong momentum in various parts across our store base. But we're also in the best in-stock position we've been since pre-pandemic. We're investing in in-stocks. We're up around 400 basis points in in-stocks when you compare to where we are this year versus last. And when you look at our clearance inventory, while we don't give specific numbers, our clearance and aged inventory is actually down versus last year. And I would say both those in-stock positions and you look at our clearance and aged inventory, are both really good indicators of the quality that we have. And I would just say as we look ahead to the back-half, we're committed to making sure we're investing in the categories that are working. We're investing in being a dependable supplier and making sure that we have our key core CUE products on shelf. And I feel really good about the innovation pipeline we're investing and being in a position to drive sales. So quality of inventory remains strong. We're in a great in-stock position and feel good about the inventory position. Peter Benedict : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open. Chuck Grom : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Hope you guys are well. Just get back to the comp discussion, how -- the past few quarters, comps have been running close to flat. You've got a long term guide of about 4% to 5%. Clearly, the macro has not been your friend, but can you help us think about the building blocks to get back to that level and maybe a potential timeline you see to get there as well? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Yes, hi, Chuck, and thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we still feel very confident in our long term guidance and there's really two main factors that we see as -- that are macro factors that are impacting us right now for performing at that long term guidance rate, namely the shift in consumer spend from goods to services and the second being deflation, inflation. And so now if you hit both of those, if you think about our average ticket for the first half of the year, which is roughly flat, historically, we would have at a minimum kind of a 1.5%-ish maybe average ticket growth, could be 2%, 2.5%. So even if we just had some favorability in average ticket, all of a sudden, that walks you up to nearly a 1.5 or 2 point comp right there. And then if you think about PCE, year-to-date, services are up 6%, 7%, whereas goods are up 1%. If you were to see that normalize, even if goods underperformed services, say, goods are 2.5% or 3% and maybe services are 3%, 3.5%, you get that extra point to 2 points on the goods kind of rising tide, and all of a sudden, you're walking back to a 4%, 4.5% comp right there. And so we really do see it as cleanly as that, is that at some -- kind of in the future, it certainly have confidence that deflation will moderate and we'll get back to a consistent kind of inflation rate in this country and in our business. And then similarly, expect that the good services shift will moderate. I mean, I think that's probably the bigger question. We probably have a better lens as to when the deflation will moderate, because we see that in our business. But on the goods and services, I think that's kind of the open question. It is only 90 basis points away from its pre-COVID levels. So it doesn't have a significantly further to go. But is that six months, is that nine months? Is that three months? I think time will tell there. Thanks, Chuck, for the question. Chuck Grom : Great. Thanks, Hal. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to talk about the big ticket strength. We know this is something that you saw in the first quarter. Can you remind us how much of sales this represents? And how does big ticket needs change in the second half? What falls into that category for the cooler and winter months versus what you saw in the first half of the year? Kurt Barton : Yes. Hi, Kate, good morning. This is Kurt. On big-ticket, I'll share a few specifics on that. As we mentioned, we've been continually pleased this year to see the rebound on big ticket after a couple of years of softness in big ticket. First quarter ran positive high-single-digit big ticket and the ever important Q2 ran a low double-digit growth rate in big ticket. So if -- you hear the commentary from us on our investment in that area of the business, how we're driving the sales through innovation. So very pleased with the results on big ticket. Q2 tends to have the largest portion of our sales on big ticket in the low teens. It averages in the high single-digit as a percentage of our sales for the year. So in the second half of the year, it does become a lesser of an impact. But on a year-over-year basis, we really do see that there's opportunity in the back half of the year in areas that we're winning in that, Seth just mentioned, whether it be recreational vehicles or even riders. And then in the back fourth quarter, really some of the winter-related heating, log splitters, those type, snow blowers, we can continue to win in innovation and our ability to drive great value in big ticket. So it's certainly one of the tailwinds for us. The team has done an excellent job bringing new product to our customers and driving value even through areas like deferred financing as a great value for big ticket. So while not as much of a swing factor in the second half, we do believe that's one of the tailwinds on our comps for the second half of the year. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my question, I just want to follow-up a bit on inventory. And I know you discussed this already, but just to be clear, so inventories gets us on face value where you did see coming out of the quarter higher than usual. So is it your expectation then that, over the next, whatever, couple of quarters, your inventory levels will moderate kind of naturally or is there some type of more aggressive action you have to take to get inventories back in line with sales? Hal Lawton : Hi, Brian. I'll start by saying, we are very comfortable with our inventory levels right now and the quality of our inventory. And we don't see any actions required on the quality of our inventory as we move forward. Just to be very clear on that. There's two main drivers of our inventory increases, really three main drivers of our inventory increases year-over-year. The first I would call out, as Kurt did, which was easier -- the kind of net -- the lapping of comparison last year. We were down, I think, negative 1.7% on inventory last year. The second is our investment in big ticket. Obviously, those are higher average unit retail items. So that's going to disproportionately drive our inventory dollars up. But we saw the strength in riders, in UTVs, in things like grills and other big ticket categories, we invested into that. And we'll continue to do that into Q3 as well. As an example, we typically have about 800 stores that are kind of go long stores and riders that have an extended season. This year, we've increased that to 1,150 stores. We are seeing the strength in big ticket continue into Q3. So that is a -- that investment is -- is paying-off and we expect it to continue to. The third thing I would call out is just a reiteration of what Kurt and Seth said, which is our investment in in-stock rates. We are 4 points higher year-over-year in in-stock rates. It's our highest in-stock rate since the pandemic. And that is really on the shelves inside of our stores. And as you all know, I spent a lot of time in our stores, been in five different markets in the last five weeks. We have never looked healthier and better since my time at the company in areas like dog treats, in areas like leashes, in hardware, in hand tools, in areas like lubricants and batteries. As Seth called out, our clearance levels are lower than last year at this time and in incredibly good shape. As you all know, our clearance levels have been running at historic lows since the pandemic and continue to do so. The team is doing an excellent job navigating inventory. So anyway, to step back, we feel incredibly good about the quality of our inventory, have no concerns about it in the second half and in fact, feel great about the investments we've made, which are driving in-stock rates and kind of a bit of a go longer strategy in big ticket. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Brian Nagel : No, thanks, I appreciate all the color. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Steven Forbes : Good morning. How -- it's probably imperfect, but it looks like it's been about a year now where sales per member trends are down significantly. So curious if there's anything notable in terms of learning from the trends within the customer cohorts as we think about explaining away the spread between comp trends or CUE trends versus member trends? And maybe in that -- in that regard, as you think about potential, like how would you speak to the opportunity ahead given where the member base and the member share sits today? Hal Lawton : Yes, so maybe I'll talk a little bit about our Neighbor's Club in that -- in that context. First off, I would say we continue to be very pleased, and in fact, it's kind of performing better than what we would expect to gain here in terms of number of members signing-up for Neighbor's Club, as I called out, now at 36 million. The second thing I'd call out is we continue to see retention rates of our Neighbor's Club remain at kind of historic rates. So as you're growing your member base and you're growing retention, I mean, that's a kind of a strong kind of balance there, right, and add -- and multiple -- increasingly added it together. I'd say what we saw was on are higher income cohorts that are our strength, stronger retention, modest moderation by I mostly in kind of the -- as we -- and when we looked at it, a lot of it, we really do core that they are the ones that over indexed on services and on travel and on vacations here in the second quarter. But again, modest moderation there. The group that we continue to focus on, and we called this out last quarter as well is that entry cohort into our Neighbor's Club and we lowered the tier threshold and we increased the type of rewards you could redeem at the last -- in -- in our last quarter and saw nice improvement there. We're continuing to focus on that through the second quarter. As we look towards the back half, we're very excited about the implementation of our customer data platform, how that's going to further accelerate our ability to personalize with customers and our communications and help continue to stimulate all groups, but in particular that kind of entry level group. In addition, we launched this quarter our Hometown Heroes program. It's off to an excellent start in terms of member sign-up. And as we called out, while I don't expect these trends to continue, the early sign-ups have been a significant piece of it is new to Tractor Supply and new to our Neighbor's Club program. So we have -- I think it's one of the best membership programs, loyalty programs -- loyalty programs, excuse me, in the market out there. The team continues to iterate and make it better and better. Our customers continue to give us very favorable marks on it. And we do see Neighbor's Club as instrumental to our success as we move forward. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Steven. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. Your line is now open. Oliver Wintermantel : Yes, thanks guys. With the variability of the outcomes in the range for the third quarter and the fourth quarter, maybe it would be helpful if you could walk us through comp ticket and comp traffic expectations for those two quarters. And maybe on the ticket side, maybe you can't break it out in AUR or inflation? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hi, Oliver, how are you today? Thanks for the question. I would -- the main driver of the variation for the second half in the range of outcomes for our comp is really what the driver of our range for the first-half was, is transactions. As we've been, I think pretty transparent, we have great insight to average ticket, great insight into our average unit retail. Pending some mix we know exactly what our pricing for our seasonal products are already going to be for the year. We know what our CUE trends are. We obviously have a perspective on how we're going to be pricing CUE into the back half of the year. So we have very good forward-looking view as to our average unit retail. And so I feel like there's probably less variability in ticket and expect that to be reasonably flat throughout the year, although there's some modestly easier compares on average unit retail as you get into the fourth quarter. So a little bit of upside there. But the main driver of our range of outcomes is going to be transactions. And particularly in the fourth quarter and really we think it's all around consumer sentiment and also drivers of need. And if there's some weather events, that will drive need. And depending on the federal election and the shortened holiday season, I think that will drive sentiment. Those two things will come together to drive our transactions. And so anyway, back to your point, I think the variability for the back half of the year is really primarily transactions with maybe a very modest range of outcomes on AUR. Oliver Wintermantel : Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck. Hal Lawton : Yes. Thanks, Oliver. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Zachary Fadem : Hi, good morning. Kurt, you mentioned the election as a potential second half headwind. So first, are there performance callouts during prior elections? And then second, is there any evidence to suggest that your business may perform differently based on the outcome of the election? Kurt Barton : Yes. Hi, Zach. In regards to elections, in my history, as we've -- as we've looked at that and we have been through cycles, there is no real meaningful performance change based on the year of a federal election or the outcome of a federal election. Now we have seen, and I think it's well-understood that this is a very intense environment today with this election. What that does to the consumer sentiment is certainly one that we are being conscious of. And I think the election will take a lot of attention and could impact the consumer spending habits, et cetera. But really, over the years, how we've seen the performance of the consumer has really proven to have no strong indication that we should plan for or change our outlook in any particular way. It's just viewed as one that could be a variable in the ranges of outcome. And so we're conscious of that. But we've been able to pivot in either one of these environments. And the one last thing I would just point to is that for us, which I think is different is that it doesn't tend to have much of a change because it's a needs-based business where regardless of the outcome, the lifestyle and the needs that we serve, don't really change that much. So we watch and we're creating strategies under scenarios, but we don't see a specific outcome that we are planning for. Zachary Fadem : Got it. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. I'm French now. So Mike, my question is on the commodity side. So corn has come down a lot since the start of the year and even where it was at the end of the first quarter. Historically, you've talked about corn being one of the biggest commodities to watch. So I guess to what extent have you thought about that in terms of affecting your sequential reflation expectations? And does that quickly turn into the sort of the feed category? And then on the pet food side, are you seeing price investment from the big pet food brands? And what are the early reads on that being enough to turn those -- the pet food category, enough elasticity to get that growing more quickly? Kurt Barton : Sure. Hi, Chris, this is Kurt. And I'll take the first part of the question on the commodities and then I'll let Seth address your question on pet food. On commodities, just some key points that I think is helpful to reference. Corn, which is the largest commodity impact item. But additionally, when you think of corn, soybean, cotton, steel, they all are commodities that play into our pricing. They have all been at year-to-date or year-over-year in the low teens deflationary point compared to June of 2023. All of them are generally back to 2019 levels. And they are 30% or nearly 40% off of their '22 -- 2022 year highs. So we've been going through a two year cycle of that. And all indications are we are at the 2019 levels. We're at what we believe is the trough. Most of these costs have already been embedded into it. The only other variability that -- and I indicated to that is, you would look at Q4 and see that to be a neutral or potentially even beginning to see an inflationary turn and the way commodities shift, will I think will really derive whether or not Q4 even the Q1 is a shift into some slight inflation or keeps us at a plateau. The corns and soybeans tend to move within about a 60 to 90 day timeframe through our systems. And so they move pretty quickly and impact the cost of goods sold in a really timely basis. I'll turn it over to Seth on the follow-up question on pet food. Seth Estep : Yes, hi, Chris, Seth. Hi, just as the simplest answer, I would just say when you look at the back-half, we're not seeing any signaling that you're going to see like AUR compression when it comes to pet food, when we look out. Right now, AURs continue to be somewhat flat year-over-year and that's kind of what we see going forward. Relative both feed and pet food, I would say, like as you think about the current environment we're in, and if you continue to see commodities stay where they are, you'll start to see things like you've traditionally seen in the industry where more value packs, more bonus packs, things of that nature will continue to hit the market. So at this point, we see pet food pricing remaining basically stable. Christopher Horvers : Thanks very much. Mary Winn Pilkington : Victoria we will take one more question quickly, and then we'll wrap the call after that. Operator : Of course. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Peter Keith : Thank you very much everyone for squeezing me in. So Hal you mentioned in the script that the channel was down negative mid-single. I guess I would agree with that based on our survey work. So it does suggest that Tractor Supply share gains accelerated in Q2 versus prior quarters. And I'm wondering, was there something specific to the quarter or do you think there's more kind of structural benefits based on your initiatives that could keep the share gains elevated in the quarters to come? Thanks. Hal Lawton : Yes, hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. I'd really point to -- to two things. One, I think structurally, we play a little bit more in big-ticket than a lot of the other farm and ranch competitors on the margins, but I think that helped raise our waterline a little bit on total sales. Also I would say, on the CUE business, in particular on the feed side, well, the CUE business in general, particularly dog food and animal feed, we're gaining share in both. Our share gains in animal Feed, in our view in Q2 were outsized. And I think a lot of that comes down to our scale, our cost position, both with working with our vendors and our partners there, but also our supply chain and whether it's our DCs, our mixing centers, our freight partners and just us having the best cost position in the market, being able to invest that appropriately in price. As you know, we have over 20 price zones. We're able to get really targeted in where we want to price and how we need to price to drive those units. So I think those would be the things I'd speak to. And then the final point would be, of course, our strategic initiatives. And I think as it relates to say like the fusion remodel program, we're approaching half of our store base now being in the fusion remodel program. So I think our store environments relative to the farm and ranch channel are significantly higher-level of a store environment now. Our commitment to customer service, we called that out. So you get, I think a better level of customer service in our stores. And so just all those sorts of things are starting to add up to continue to drive the outsized share gains. Thanks Peter, for the question. Peter Keith : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Victoria, we'll wrap-up our call today. To everyone on the call, we look forward to speaking to you at the time of our Q3 call in October. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Hal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members. I know we all have been watching the devastation over the last few weeks that's been wrecked by Hurricane Helene and Milton with great concern and heartbreak. Hurricane Helene struck particularly close to the heart for me, given my roots in East Tennessee. Tractor Supply has taken a multitude of actions, big and small to take care of our team members, customers, and communities during this difficult time. I'd like to give a special thank you to all our team members who rallied to help the communities impacted by this storm season. We will continue to be there for our team members, customers from our communities in the days and months ahead for the recovery process. I would also like to thank our many vendor partners who are stepping up in the recovery effort. As it relates to a sales benefit from our response, we had no material benefit in Q3, but have seen an impact in Q4 and additionally have been somewhat encouraged by the recent change of seasons. This morning, we shared some exciting news that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Allivet, a leading online pet pharmacy. This is a company we know very well as they've been excellent partners to us in fulfilling our pet subscription business for the last couple of years. This is a great opportunity for us to bring another benefit to our 37 million Neighbor's Club members. Allivet offers a convenient and cost-effective way to get medications and specialty items for their pets and livestock. The addition of Allivet allows us to expand our total addressable market by about $15 billion. Allivet is a best-in-class platform with an excellent management team and a strong financial profile. This is a great example of a strategic tuck-in acquisition. We anticipate that Allivet will be accretive to earnings in 2025, and we look forward to welcoming the Allivet team to Tractor Supply. We are planning to host an Investment Community Day in New York City on the afternoon of Thursday, December 5th. At that time, we look forward to providing more details on our Life Out Here strategy for the second half of the decade, including our plans to leverage Allivet online and in stores. So now let's shift to the quarter. For the third quarter, the macro retail environment was in line with our expectations and our customer remained resilient. While the overall economy remained strong as evidenced by a 3% Q2 GDP, overall retail sales continued to moderately underperform. The primary driver of this underperformance is the continued shift of consumer spend to services. As a consequence, we estimate that retail sales growth was nearly flat in our third quarter. It is our estimate that the Farm & Ranch channel was modestly negative in the quarter and that we continue to be a share gainer. I would describe the sentiment of our customer as relatively stable as supported by the recent jobs report and the current unemployment rate of 4.1%. Consistent with prior quarters, our consumer continues to be judicious with their spending focused on innovation, newness, and needs-based products. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the macro retail environment is running in line with the subdued expectations that we had as we entered the year. Also, as expected, our team has managed our business exceptionally well. Correspondingly, our sales and profitability to continue to run in the range of our beginning guidance and have allowed us to consistently raise the lower end of our outlook. Let's turn to some highlights of our performance for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.6% with comparable-store sales down a slight 0.2%. Diluted EPS was $2.24. Our comparable-store sales performance was driven by transaction growth of 0.3%, offset by average ticket decline of 0.5%. Emergency response, as mentioned earlier, had no material impact on Q3 comp sales. As we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in line with our full-year guidance. As we move through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first half of the year continued to play out. Notably, our customer engagement remains strong. The investments we've made in our Neighbor's Club, our world-class loyalty program are a competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in customer counts and retention. Our Neighbor's Club comp sales continue to outpace our overall sales growth. At the same time, we reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and a record membership of more than 37 million members. Our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. Our Hometown Heroes program has gained traction with our customers as our store team members have rallied around this unique benefit as an opportunity to engage with veterans and first responders in their local communities. Additionally, our new customer data platform has gone live for all stores and digital platforms, which will allow for greater data integrity, a 360-degree view of our customer, and deeper personalization. Overall, our Neighbor's Club offerings continue to drive meaningful wins with our members. At Tractor Supply, we continue to invest in customer service as we believe is it a differentiator for us. Our customers come to us for trusted advice. Our commitment to excellence and service and investments in training, tools, and technology are being recognized by our customers. Our scores continue to run at all-time highs with improvements year-over-year every month for 40 consecutive months. Turning to our category performance. Strong positive comps in big-ticket items continued for the third quarter, notably in Zero-turn, and Front Engine Riding lawnmowers as well as recreational vehicles. This year, our team did a tremendous job bringing newness and innovation with attractive pricing to these categories and our customers have responded positively to the new product lineup and our investment in inventory. As we experienced last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable, and edible products would run modestly below in the chain average in the third quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail. The needs-based demand-driven nature of our product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business. Specifically in Pet Food, industry data suggests the category was slightly positive in Q3, consistent with trends through the first part of the year as the category disinflates and pet ownership trends remain soft. Our business in this category, while moderating from historical trends, continues to be a share winner in both households and dollars, although this is a small number math at this point. A couple of data points on share. Tractor supply was 2 times the category growth rate in Q3 and nearly 6 times that of the grocery channel. Again, pointing back that this is small number math relative to the previously higher-growth rates that this category has seen in the last few years. In the quarter, in the Pet business, we invested in in-stock inventory rates, maintain our emphasis on EDLP, leveraged our customer service to drive basket building, and focused our marketing on the newness and innovation we've added to our lineup. In our most recent all-store meeting, we invested in training for our nearly 45,000 store team members on selling techniques for pet food and driving treat attachments. We also had a very successful Pet Appreciation Days where we marketed newly introduced brands like ACANA and Real Mesa and our exclusive brands such as Retriever, 4health, and MuttNation by Miranda Lambert. In Equine, livestock, and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While average unit retails are down mid-to-high single-digits in these categories, we had unit or pound growth across all species. And as large animal counts continue to be pressured, we are certainly a shared winner with our strong unit performance. Much like the first half of the year, categories that performed below our comp sales growth were in our discretionary businesses such as clothing, footwear and outdoor living as well as in hardlines products such as ag fencing and pet kennels. Additionally, seasonal businesses such as heating, heating fuel, and insulated outerwear were negative. Our customer continues to respond to newness and innovation. A great example is the strong start to our Halloween Decor, which included a differentiated and expanded assortment such as the six-foot rooster skeleton that went viral. Another great example is in wildlife supplies, we're a destination for deer corn and have expanded this year into trail cameras and feeders. Our digital sales continue to outperform with double-digit growth. The team has made substantial improvements in search and checkout. We continue to accelerate our digital sales with platforms that set the standard for our customers and rival best-in-class retail experiences. We opened 16 new tractor supply stores in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 54. Our new-store productivity continues to perform very well. Our pipeline for '25 and into '26 remains very robust with significant runway for low-risk, value-creating organic growth ahead of us. As we exited the third quarter, we've achieved some significant milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have 45% of our chain in our Project Fusion layout and more than 550 garden centers. These are capital investments that provide a multi-year runway for growth and extend the terminal value of our stores. They help us to be more relevant to both our core and new customers, allowing us to garner a greater share of their spending and be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. I commend the team on these investments and results given the scope and scale of these initiatives. It is hard to identify another retailer that has made this substantial investment in their store base in such a short period of time. We've also made major investments in our supply chain. Over the last four years, the team has added 2 million square feet to our DC capacity with the seamless opening of two new distribution centers. These new DCs have allowed us to service our existing store base while providing flexibility for future volume and new-store growth. The addition of 10 mixing centers, bringing our total to 16 has improved our service levels to our stores. A new import distribution center has also allowed for greater flexibility to flow our seasonal goods. As a result, we have had a 20% structural improvement in our STEM models and corresponding cost savings. Our DC productivity has also reached strong levels. In conclusion, the team is performing admirably short term and long term. True to truck supply style, we are efficiently managing the elements within our control and advancing our Life Out Here strategy. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are raising the low end of our guidance for the fiscal '24 sales and earnings to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the fourth quarter of the year. The fourth quarter has started out well as we benefited from emergency response sales for Hurricane Helene and Milton, both of which were fourth quarter events for us. This sales benefit is reflected in our guidance for the year. As we plan for the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as is typical in an election year. We are capitalizing on our strengths and enhancing our competitive edge in the market with the support of our team members, their strong connections with our customers, and our successful strategic initiatives, we continue to outpace our competitors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kurt to provide more color on our performance and outlook. Kurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Hal mentioned, our third quarter top-line results were consistent with our expectations and in line with the results in the first half of the year. We saw continued strength in big ticket sales, while our discretionary categories remained pressured. Our seasonal category performance, exclusive of big ticket, was in line with chain average at a modest decline to prior year. Similar to the first half of the year, we saw strong performance in seasonal categories such as live goods, mulches and soils, grilling, and wildlife supplies. This was offset by softness in ag fencing, heating, outdoor living, and lawn and garden tools. As we expected, our C.U.E. performance was slightly below the chain average given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing. Retail price deflation, which was approximately 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our C.U.E. categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in C.U.E. as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter and are now starting to lap the beginning of this deflationary cycle from last year. Our comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain within a range of down 2% to up modestly. The strongest regional performance was in Texhoma due to inventory investments made in big ticket, easier compares, and better overall weather compared to last year. This strength was offset by pressure in the Far West, Midwest, and Commonwealth as the summer heat lingered and a lack of the change of season to fall in these areas. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%. Weather was generally a net neutral factor in the third quarter comparable sales results. Extreme heat persisted throughout the quarter in certain regions with no shift to cooler weather in the northern regions. Hurricane Helene and other storms in the last two weeks of the quarter did not produce net incremental sales to Q3 as any pre-hurricane demand was more than offset by softer volume in the South as a result of heavy rains and continued intense heat in the Far West and Midwest regions. We do believe this created a timing shift that has benefited early Q4 sales. Moving down to our income statement. Our gross margin increased 56 basis points compared to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an Everyday Low Price strategy. These improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below-chain average margins. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 119 basis points to 27.8%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation and amortization, as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs given the decline in comparable-store sales. The new DC was approximately a 25 basis point headwind on SG&A for the quarter. We were also lapping a one-time depreciation expense benefit in the prior year of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million. These factors were partially offset by strong productivity and cost control and to a lesser extent, a slight benefit from our ongoing sale-leaseback transactions. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 9.4%. Diluted EPS was $2.24 compared to $2.33 last year, which included a $0.08 benefit from the depreciation change I mentioned earlier. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, representing an increase of 4.3% in average inventory per store. Last quarter, we shared that we had strategically invested in inventory as we look to improve our in-stock position in queue and support the strength in our big-ticket sales. We effectively controlled our inventory as we reduced our average inventory growth per store by more than 50% sequentially from the second quarter. Our inventory levels and in-stock rates are in excellent shape as we enter the fourth quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2 times. Our announced acquisition of Allivet fits perfectly with our tuck-in M&A strategy and is highly complementary to our business. Given that we have significant financial flexibility, this acquisition will be financed by our balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $760 million of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Looking ahead, we are updating our fiscal 2024 guidance to raise the lower end of the range on both the top line and earnings. We now anticipate net sales to be in the range of $14.85 billion to $15 billion. We expect comparable-store sales to be between flat-to-up 1%. We are forecasting an operating margin rate of 9.8% to 10.1%. Our net income is expected to be between $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion, and we anticipate diluted earnings per share of $10.10 to $10.40 compared to our prior guidance of $10 to $10.40. As I see it today, our outlook for the remainder of the year is appropriately described as right down the middle of the fairway. At this time, we believe that our EPS will more likely be at the midpoint of the range, allowing for a breadth of possibilities that remains quite varied for Q4. As Hal mentioned, the fourth quarter is off to a solid start with the most significant sales weeks of the quarter still ahead of us. We continue to see the quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes on comp sales given the easier compares while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending. On the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter, lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the emergency response activity from the recent hurricanes. On the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big-ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the federal election, and a shorter holiday selling season with five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our outlook on gross margin, SG&A, and operating margin remain consistent with past commentary. In the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult gross margin comparison with 129 basis points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiative. As to SG&A, we anticipate better performance than in the third quarter given our comp sales outlook. We continue to forecast the return of capital to our shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term. In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our financial outlook for the year. At Tractor Supply, our philosophy is to stay on offense and remain proactive. We're enthusiastic about the progress of our Life Out Here strategy, maintaining our industry leadership and expanding our legacy of generating long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I will turn the call-back over to Hal to wrap up. Hal Lawton : Thank you, Kurt. I continue to believe that the structural backdrop remains very attractive for Tractor Supply. We participate in a large, attractive, fragmented, and growing market. We're a consistent share gainer and have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiatives, our market being a beneficiary of continued net rural migration, and high-return new-store growth opportunities. Short-term and long-term, Tractor Supply is extremely well-positioned as the leader in Life Out Here. As we look to close the always important fourth quarter, we have exciting plans in place to drive sales. We're in the midst of launching our first Hometown Heroes Days. Veterans and first responders over-index in our communities and Tractor Supply is uniquely positioned to celebrate those who keep us safe and make Life Out Here possible. The event starts on Saturday with a chain-wide event with our stores hosting their community to interact with fire trucks, K-9 units, and ambulances as well as food trucks and local farmer markets. Over the two weeks, we will be offering special promotions to our hometown heroes, including 10% off on First Responders Day and Veterans Day. Hometown Heroes Days is the perfect way to drive excitement for this program and for Neighbor's Club more broadly. This is a unique event, which will further support and strengthen this important customer segment's shopping affinity with Tractor Supply and is a great way for us to give back to them. We have an exceptional lineup of innovative and new products as well as enticing values and fresh offerings for the fourth quarter. In big-ticket, highlights include Massimo golf carts, Liberty Safes, Tractor Cam cameras, even Ember patio heaters, and Blackstone Grills. In our CUE business, we're expanding our cat food assortment, testing new items such as freeze-dried sacks, adding exclusive SKUs and Nutrena Triumph Equine Feed, and launching exclusive brand extensions such as 4health Shreds. In tools, we're offering notable deals across our tool shop event on brands such as DeWalt Porter Cable and it introduced new tailgating truck boxes just in time for the outdoor season. Our garden centers will be transformed to a winter wonderland with live Christmas trees, set is reeves and tractor eyes seasonal decor. And while the holiday merchandising is fun and brings great retail theater to our stores, what is most important in the fourth quarter to driving our business is the weather. And so to this year, as always, we'll be offering our customers all the things they need to weather the winter, including log splitters, snow throwers, chainsaws, and more. And if and when the winter comes, our customers know they can count on us for these critical supplies to get through the winter as well as products like propane and alternative heating sources. With strong inventory levels, we're committed to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. Our stores are well-stocked with the key products our customers depend on for their home and maintenance needs in the winter months. I hope you get a chance to get in our stores this season to see firsthand the great merchandising initiatives we have in place. As I mentioned earlier, please mark your calendar for our investment community today to be held on the afternoon of Thursday, December 5th. The team is excited to share our growth strategy for the back half of the decade. We're confident in our ability to navigate the challenges and seize the significant opportunities we see ahead. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Zach Fadem : Hi, good morning. So now that about 25% of your stores have lawn and garden centers and roughly half of your stores are converted to Fusion. Curious if that historical mid-single-digit lift for the combination is still holding in this environment, which if it is, it would mean about 150 basis-points to the comp, if that's right. And then how should we think about the outlook for lawn and garden Fusion and any other store initiatives that you have planned for '25? Hal Lawton : Hi, Zach, it's Hal Lawton and good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Yes, great milestone for us that we've reached with over 1,000 stores now in our Fusion format and 500 stores in our Garden Center format, over 500 stores. You think back to where we were in August of -- I mean, October of 2020 when we had zero of each. So come a long ways in a short amount of time. As we look forward, we feel good both about the pace that we're doing on our remodel program, which is between 175 and 225 stores a year. We've been consistently running at that pace the last couple of years. Of course, all new stores are built with the Fusion concept. And then between half and three-quarters of the stores just depending on a variety of factors are receiving the Garden Center a bit more on the new stores because we have a little more control of the setup, but the same on existing store remodels as well. And then, yes, we are continuing to be very pleased with the performance of Fusion. Those stores do continue to outpace the broader chain. Additionally, they continue to have higher customer scores on key areas of things like store environment, clean and uncluttered, those sorts of things. They also tend to have a higher female as well as a younger shopper base as well. So all the both quant and qual metrics that we've shared historically on Fusion continue to occur and we continue to be very pleased with the Garden Center business, while it's been a couple of years now of tougher spring/summer weather, we continue to have strong performance in live goods, as we talked about as well as all the other ancillary products that go around it. And then this year, we'll be using, as I talked about in our prepared remarks, the Fusion setup even to bring even a heightened and more well-done, fall execution as well as Winter Wonderland execution. So all in all, very good progress. And just to wrap it up. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the Farm and Ranch channel being negative in the kind of low to kind of mid-single digits, call it a minus 2%, minus 3%, maybe minus 4%. And you look at our overall growth of 1.6% and would point to many of our competitive advantages and strategic initiatives we have been implement -- that we've been investing in as the reasons for that share gain. And one of the important ones is Fusion as you -- as we just went through the numbers. So I think it's Fusion is doing well. It's a major contributor to our share gain and we're excited to continue the initiatives we turn into the back half of the decade. Zach Fadem : Appreciate your time, Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Zach. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thanks, and good morning. So I just want to talk about the weather and the storms. So can you talk about what the storms have done for your business so far and sort of what's embedded into the balance of the quarter? It seems like you're targeting about a roughly 2% comp in the fourth quarter. And then on the -- just on the margin front, you start to lap the transportation cost tailwinds as you talked about. Does the emergency response create some headwinds in gross margin that we should think about in the fourth quarter and does that DC headwind go away in SG&A? Thank you. Kurt Barton : Oh. Hi, Chris, it's Kurt. In regards to I was taking notes on what I think there's about three points in there. There is the question on the storms. There's a question in regards to the margin on DC headwinds and or DC benefit and when does that turn in the emerging response. So let me just try to hit those things. In regards to the weather, I'll just mention Q3 first as I had mentioned some of that in prepared remarks. Leading up till about mid-September, just as an example, the business was running at a slight positive comp sales trend. And in the back two weeks, while we did see benefit like in emergency response from generators and others at the front-end of Hurricane Helene because that's one of those storms that really straddles both quarters. It was offset or more than offset by -- in that particular storm across most of the South and Southeast, just blanketed with storms. And so that dampened a bit of the overall traffic in the last week or two of September. As I mentioned, I see that more as a positive because that just defers some of the demand on the business. So both Helene and Milton have had net for the full year in Q4, a benefit to us. We'll have -- we have so many of the important weeks ahead of us. I won't quantify exactly what we expect from these storms, but generally, hurricanes have a modest level of benefit on each hurricane, and we anticipate that for Q4. Emergency response has a mixture of product, some of the bigger ticket generators lower, but has a mix of higher margins. So we do not anticipate the storm's emergency response really having an impact on margin in the fourth quarter. And yes, the distribution center been a headwind to SG&A in 2024 does start to cycle out as you get about 9 months to 12 months out. It really takes about that much time to be able to even out the inventory and be able to have the other distribution centers have a productivity offset to it. So we'll share more information on 2025 in regards to that in our January call. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chuck Grom : Hi, good morning. Thanks very much, guys. In the past on your third quarter calls, you've provided some early framework for the out year in terms of store count, margin, puts and takes, et cetera. Is there anything we should be mindful of as we build out our models for next year? And then along those lines, you have a long-term comp algo of 4% to 5%. I'm sure you don't want to underline getting to that next year, but can we think about the puts and takes over the next 12 months to 18 months on the comp front? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hi, Chuck. Good morning. I think on the two things I'd say as it relates to looking out into next year and beyond. One, I think we've got a very clear recipe of how we're operating our business right now in terms of, this year we increased from 70 new stores to 80 new stores, and we've talked about how we're moving to 90 new stores next year. And that is the recipe that we're planning on. We have an exciting portfolio of high-return new-store opportunities out there. We've been challenged by many of our investors to go capture that value sooner. And we're kind of moving in that direction. We talked earlier about our consistent remodel approach somewhere between 175 and 220 stores a year. If you think about that it kind of the average of that at 200 with 2,300 stores roughly right now. That means about every 10 years, we're remodeling a store, which is I think, a nice healthy run rate for a retailer. And other than that, there's no real outliers on how we're thinking about the business as we turn into next year as it relates to our long-term comp algorithm. I'd point to the same commentary we had on the last call, which is we look to return to that as quickly as possible and the two major factors impacting our doing so is inflation, deflation, and consumer spending nominally between services and goods. If you look at deflation, inflation, Kurt had some comments on that earlier and we start to lap some of that around now, and we'll continue to lap that over the next 6 months to 9 months and then start to really be through that cycle. And if we all look at the low price for corn was really middle of this year and we would -- but we also had the big dip down that we took last year starting in October. And then on goods to services, the consumer continues to have to shift a number of a good bit of their spend into services right now. If you look at whether it's rent, insurance costs, those sorts of things, I mean, services continues to outpace the spend on goods, somewhere in the range of 6 to 7 points versus, say, 1 to 2 points on goods. And you can see that kind of correspondingly into retail sales. And as I talked about in the call, we think retail sales were slightly positive in the 1%-ish, 1.5% range for Q3, our fiscal Q3 and our sales were right in line, if not slightly above that at the 1.6% range. So that's kind of how we see the macro-environment shaping up right now and what we see as we turn the corner to 2025. Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Grom : Great. Thanks, Hal. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead Karen Short : Hi, thanks. Great to talk to you again and look forward to seeing you in December. So my question is, looking at 4Q when you look at the range of outcomes on sales and gross profit dollars and gross margins, it's pretty wide. So wondering if you could address that. And then also looking to -- so and commenting on more specifically puts and takes on 4Q on gross margins and SG&A. But then wanted to address more specifically the longer-term algo and when you think you can return to that? And I assume you'll address that at the Analyst Day, but any preliminary comments would be great. Hal Lawton : Yes. Hi, Karen. On the long-term algo, maybe hit that one first. I very much, as I've said just a moment ago, look-forward to getting back to our long-term algo. We don't see any internal issues in terms of returning to our long-term algo. Our market continues to be incredibly favorable in terms of just the overall optics of our market, the strength of our markets, attractiveness of our markets. Our position and competitive differentiation in the market is as strong as it's ever been. We think the combination of those two absolutely in normal operating kind of circumstances lead to our long-term algo. We're very confident in our ability to return to that long-term algo and the two main things that we're watching in the context of returning to that are, as I mentioned earlier, the goods to services split on overall consumer expenditures. And then two, how inflation, deflation plays out and then that plays into our average ticket. As we've talked about in the past, our recipe is really a 50% growth based on average ticket, 50% growth based on comp transactions. The goods to services shift is much more about a transactions type of headwind. And then the inflation, deflation, obviously being an average ticket headwind. We do see that both the pressure, the headwinds on both of those dissipating into 2025. I think the question is to what degree and over what period of time through '25. And we will share more of that, a little bit of that in our Investor Day. And then certainly, you'll hear our perspective on that in our Q4 earnings call. As it relates to the range of outcomes in sales in Q4, I'll address that and then Kurt can speak to some of the gross margin ins and outs. But on the range of sales, I'd start with in the month of October has played out much like what we expected with the one addition being the hurricanes that Kurt talked about previously, all right. Those will provide a modest benefit to Q4. As Kurt shared in the past, we've seen maybe 20, 30 basis points of benefit for a hurricane of those sizes. And I think something to that effect is what's in our guidance in Q4. The other major things that are going to play into Q4. One is going to be weather and it needs to get cold for our business to really perform well in Q4. We saw a lot of heating pellets. We saw a lot of heating fireplaces. We saw a lot of insulated outerwear and a lot of other products in our business that are cold-weather related. We've had about a week, week-and-a-half of cold-weather this quarter so far. When that hit, it was very good. It's now probably -- if everybody can think about where they're sitting right now, it's very warm right now. And so by consequence, people aren't buying heating and insulated out of ware. So we've had a bit of a mix in October, and that's typically what you can expect in October. As you look forward into the last two months, it really comes down to the continuation of cold weather, do we get it in November? Do we get it in December? Last year, we got cold weather in neither month. The second comes down to holiday shopping. We've got five less days this year. Historically, customers have been able to compress for the most part, but the question will be just how does the calendar play-out this year? And does that occur? Also with Christmas being on a Wednesday, you've got a unique setup where online is able to play much more strongly in on that final Super Weekend than it has in the past. And then, of course, you've got the federal election and we do expect that consumer spending leading up to the federal election will be dampened both just with distraction as well as a little bit of just wait-and-see mode. And so then you've got to see how does that pick back up. But at the end of the day, as I said on my prepared remarks, while the holiday sales are important of our business, the make or break for our business is the -- is how we support our customers with what their needs are, particularly during the cooler weather season. So that's what's most indicated -- will be most indicative of our sales in Q4. And I'll turn it over to Kurt for some comments on margin. Kurt Barton : Yes, Karen, here's how we look at the gross margin and the SG&A in the fourth quarter. And I'd start by saying the all year, the business has been remarkably consistent. And so I'll refer to Q4 versus some of the highlights of Q3. We had 56 basis-points of benefit in Q3 as it was really the last quarter before we start to lap the significant benefit we started to see last year in fourth quarter on both transportation and our cost-saving and our cost-cutting initiatives. And so we'll have only a modest level of benefit remaining on transportation and cost in fourth quarter, that will for the most part likely be offset by product mix. So gross margin is relatively, give or take a bit more flattish year-over-year in Q4. And then on the SG&A side, the -- a lot of the puts and takes are similar other than in Q3, we were cycling 35 basis points benefit of a one-time depreciation. In Q4, we'll still have roughly 20 basis points, 25 basis points of pressure on the new distribution center. We anticipate a little bit more leverage on the comp sales as we anticipate positive comp sales for the fourth quarter. So you really see yourself moving in that in about a 50, 60, 65 basis points of pressure from SG&A in the fourth quarter as it's a -- it does not have as much of the one times as, say, Q3 does. So net, that does put operating margin in an unfavorable decline from year-over-year, but that's always been in our expectations for fourth quarter as we were lapping the strongest performance year-over-year. Karen Short : Thank you. Hopefully, you just bring women's wranglers to your stores. Kurt Barton : We'll make a note of that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is how one of the key debates is can Tractor Supply get back to the historic levels of 1% to 2% growth in traffic. It seems like what you're suggesting is the ability to get back to that level of traffic growth on a consistent basis is going to be macro dependent where it will be influenced by the shift from services to goods. Yet, Tractor being a more needs-based retailer that has more consistent trends in areas like consumables CUE have held up relatively well. So what specifically do you see as influencing the assortment or category performance that will improve in a more robust economic environment, more robust retail environment to drive that traffic growth? And as you see a little bit less gross margin expansion because of some of the drivers from this year stayed, would you be willing to sacrifice some gross margin in order to drive the traffic growth? Thank you very much. Hal Lawton : Hi, Michael, thanks for the question. First-off, I'd -- maybe I'll just step back, if I look at our growth over the last five years post-COVID, which I think is the second-highest in all of retail -- major retailers out there, the key to that has been strength in both average ticket and comp transactions. So it's not -- comp transaction growth has not only been a highlight of Tractor Supply for the last 30 years, 20 years, but also in the last five. And I would say of most retailers out there, we're one of the few that have been -- that have strong positive like double-digit positive comp transaction growth over a multi-five-year period. So I'd put our transaction growth over the last five years up against anyone. Second of all, I think if you look at retail right now, overall transaction growth in retail is either flat to negative in general right now. And so when you look at our modestly positive comp transactions, you combine that with overall transactions given our new-store growth and our comp transactions, I would argue we are in the top-quartile right now of retail in terms of overall transactions. So I look at --- I'm very pleased with how we've grown our transaction last five years, how we've held those transactions and even in the context of this environment that we're in, how we're modestly positive comping transactions and then with our new stores having strong couple of points of transaction growth. Then as I look forward, I think it really does all come down to the goods-to-services shift and then our customers having a little bit more money to spend on items in our stores. And that's going to make its way into that extra half of transaction a year to them and it's also going to make its way a little bit into the units per transaction. But I think what we're seeing on our comp transactions being muted a bit is very comparable to what's happening in all the rest of retail. And I certainly believe as retail moderates back to its normal levels, rising tides will lift all boats. And those of us that continue to have positive comp transactions will continue to see stronger positive comp transactions as that occurs. Anyway, I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. Thanks, Michael. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Julio Marquez : Good morning. This is Julio Marquez on for Steve. Hal, curious if you could expand on how the 37 million Neighbor's Club members informed the decision to acquire Allivet. Any -- I guess, how many Neighbor's Club use an online solution for the pet pharmacy needs? And any other color you can help contextualize the opportunity there would be great. Thank you. Hal Lawton : Yes, thanks. We are really excited about the acquisition of Allivet. I think it's a great example of kind of a tuck-in acquisition. They've been a partner to us for a few years now as our pet Rx provider. What we've observed over those few years has been best-in-class in terms of both their nationwide prescription licensing capabilities, their distribution centers and their ability to get product shipped out in 24 hours, their ability to get prescriptions approved and partner with the veterinarians, their excellent website, their strong management team and importantly also excellent financial condition. So we feel all-around. It's a great business, one that we're excited and thrilled to welcome into the Tracker Supply family and we look forward to bringing that feature of a low cost affordable, wide array of prescriptions for pets and animals to our customers. As you said, we have 37 million-plus members of our Neighbor's Club program. It's a highly engaged membership program, one that we continue to add value in and our customers continue to further and further become loyal around. And we think the combination of Allivet with our Neighbor's Club is going to just be a great mix and we look forward to over the next few years, getting the deal done, approved, closed, and then starting to bring that to our Neighbor's Club members in the ways that we've brought the additional features and benefits that we have to them. Very excited about it and more to come at our Investment Community Day on that topic on December 5th. Julio Marquez : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Kurt, following two years of flattish comps, has there been any change to the building blocks behind that 10.10% to 10.6% long-term EBIT margin guidance, realizing productivity plays a role? But are there any margin factors there that are maybe structurally higher today than where you originally framed it? Kurt Barton : No, really, there's not anything significant in our algorithm to attend 1 to a 10.6% and recognizing that we're going to continue to invest for the long term. The last two years, the comp sales puts pressure on our ability to leverage the SG&A and it's really been the difference. The team has just done a phenomenal job though, finding ways to offset that. And there are a number of cases on productivity in both our stores and our logistics distribution team that have just done a phenomenal job finding new opportunities for productivity. So the team has done well to be able to maintain that 10-plus operating margin in the last couple of years. So the algorithm is still intact. And Hal has mentioned all the different reasons of our expectations of being able to get back to the long-term algo and that just gives a better opportunity to avoid the pressures of SG&A. So I feel very confident with the long-term algo still at this point. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Peter Benedict : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Seth. Just around the big ticket strength, it certainly continues to be unique relative to most of retail. You talked about some innovation, I think some sharp pricing on these items. I'm just curious if you could expand on it. Any other factors helping here? I don't know the use of private credit has been playing a role. And how do you guys think about like replacement cycles for some of those bigger ticket categories? Is that potentially starting to tick in here? I'm just kind of curious if you expand on that a little bit. Thank you. Seth Estep : Yes. Hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. Just overall with big ticket, as we mentioned, we definitely are very pleased with the performance there as Q3 really was much in line with the strength of the performance as we exited Q2 and we really were able to maintain that. You know, the third quarter, it was our third consecutive quarter of big ticket growth and as you mentioned in some of the categories that we've had, whether it be like Zero-turns, Front Engine Eiders, Rec Vehicles, and a couple of other categories. I would point to a couple of things that have really differentiated us a little bit from the market, I believe. I would start with just the product lineup itself. I think the merchants have done a fantastic job of line structure in these categories where we are offering quality, high-value products across multiple brands, bringing innovation. We are working on differentiation with exclusive features and they're really built and tailored to our customer, right, and their customer needs with kind of the large animal or the large acre ownership across a lot of our customers. The next thing I would say is just some of the strategic inventory investments that Kurt mentioned earlier as well. When we exited Q2, we made sure we saw some of the strength here and we're looking at the weather patterns and we placed inventory in those -- in these categories to make sure that we can continue to maintain that as we went after it. And then the last thing I would just say is private-label credit card. Our private-label credit card momentum has been very strong, with that, our supplier base are partnering with us to continue to drive that. And when you just kind of combine those things together, whether it be the lineup itself, the value quality proposition, designing programs specific to the lifestyle of our customer, and then coupling that with things like our offerings, both with private-label credit cards and leveraging our Neighbors Club, it's really a combination of all those together that's really playing on it. Team is building 2025 right now either I think you'll see they'll continue to expand on those things and really excited about the lineup as we move into next year. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Peter Keith : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the continued market share gains. I wanted to ask about technology. So Hal, you had referenced some greater data integrity and personalization with Neighbor's Club. I was wondering how you're leveraging technology and AI to provide those solutions and anything that we might think about going into next year that could perhaps provide some type of sales benefit. Hal Lawton : Yes, good morning, Peter, and thanks for the question. I'd say we are infusing machine learning, data science, AI, really across the business both in our own analytics frameworks, also in leveraging our -- software providers capabilities, whether that's in things like Reflexis on inventory management or whether that's with our new CDP in terms of customer insights and personalization. And then I'm really proud that we're also building solutions internally to drive, as I've shared earlier, kind of better customer service in our stores. And whether that's through things like tractor vision, where we're upgrading our camera software and hardware technologies to be able to leverage our cameras to drive improved customer service through a variety of use cases, whether that's at the register on the apron in our garden centers or whether that's through our Hey GURA tool that we have that all of our team members are able to use to ask to get further knowledge inside of our stores when they're dealing with customers or when they just want to educate themselves. But we have a broad variety of things that we're using all really to drive improved customer service productivity with our team. Also in our distribution centers, we're doing that. We're using vision technology to be able to look at the packing of trucks, to look at left-offs of trucks to watch, to use it to manage the yard. So whether it's operationally in our DCs, whether it's for customer service in our stores or whether it's in our merchants or marketing use it for behind-the-scenes analytics and personalization. We're leveraging data science and machine learning and AI across the board. Thanks, Peter, for the question. Peter Keith : Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, we'll have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you, Mary Winn. Our final question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. First, a quick clarification. I think it might have been on Chuck's question. Are you expecting this year's same-SKU deflation to flip to same-SKU inflation in '25? And then kind of related to that, are you able to quantify to any degree the pressure on your business from the decline in farm income that we've seen because of commodity deflation? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Hi, Scott, this is Kurt. On deflation, for the first-nine months of the year, it's generally ran in-line with our plan and expectations. We have seen a bit of a additional step-down, modest on some of the commodities. I expect Q4 to have a similar but slightly less deflationary impact than Q3. But it really looks like today, if you're trying to peg when is there a point neutrality that that's been punted out anywhere from three to six months and you will have a much better view in January on what the expectation is on 2025. All indication is we are shifting out of a deflationary environment towards an inflationary one. The timing of when that conversion flips, we first thought it would be late 2024, early 2025, that could be Q1, Q2 of next year. And then in regards to your second question, remind me again that point? Scot Ciccarelli : Yes, just farm income broadly has been under pressure because of commodity deflation and just trying to figure out, have you guys been able to quantify the impact on your bills? Thanks. Kurt Barton : Yes. For years, we've looked at the farm income level in strong years and soft years. And it can have either an indirect slight halo or overhang on there and we really don't see much of a correlation to that. And as you know, I'll just point out our majority of our customers are not professional farmers. It's not their number-one source of income. And they if anything, we look sometimes at the overall market area and if there's an indirect benefit to that market area and how the non-farmers may spend. At this point, we're not really seeing anything that points to that in our business today. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Well, that will get us to the top of the hour and wrap-up our Q&A for today. As always, we're available for any follow-up calls. Please be on the lookout for the invitation to our Investment Community Day in December that Hal referenced earlier and please reach-out if you need any further information. We look-forward to the event and thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the recent wildfires and winter storms. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. I'd also like to express our deepest appreciation to the first responders who worked tirelessly to protect our communities during these challenging times. Our Tractor Supply team has and will continue to stand with our communities as they recover from these events. The opening video, I think, did an excellent job highlighting the key accomplishments of the Tractor Supply team in 2024. And my sincere appreciation and gratitude go out to the team the team for all they do. Over the year, our consistently executed with distinction and delivered solid results in a tepid retail environment. Additionally, the team made progress against our Life Out Here strategy, enabling continued market share gains and future growth. Now, let's go through some of our highlights specific to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, starting with financials. In the fourth quarter, our net sales grew 3.1%, and comparable store sales increased 0.6%, driven by strong comp transaction growth of 2.3%. And our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.44. For the fiscal year, we achieved record financial results on both the top and bottom-line. Net sales were nearly $14.9 billion, growing 2.2% versus 2023 with a comp store sales increase of 0.2%. Diluted earnings per share were also a record $2.04 on a split-adjusted basis. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1.1 billion. And I'll note, these results are on top of record performance over the last four years. In 2024, we also generated a record $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. And we use this cash flow to fund the business and attractive growth opportunities. In 2024, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 11 Petsense stores. The team has done a fantastic job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. Other business investments we made in 2024 include a new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas, and more than 160 Fusion remodels. After funding our business in these initiatives, for the fourth consecutive year, we returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. And 2024 marked the 15th consecutive year of dividend growth for Tractor Supply. And finally, at the conclusion of the year, we successfully acquired Allivet, and we look forward to integrating Allivet into our business and offering it to our millions of Neighbor's Club members who are pet owners. In addition to these financial results and even more importantly, perhaps, our team member and customer engagement has never been stronger. Frontline team member attrition is at a record low. Total active customer accounts are at record highs. High-value customer retention is at record levels. Customer service scores continue to hit all-time highs. In our Neighbor's Club, one of the largest loyalty programs in retail continues to attract record levels of new customers and we're exiting 2024 with all-time highs in both retention rates and retained customer counts. Neighbor's Club is truly a key differentiator for Tractor Supply, and we're committed to continued enhancements. For example, in 2024, our members benefited from more personalized offers, new tiers, and more meaningful rewards. Additionally, the expansion of Neighbor's Club to Petsense by Tractor Supply continues to drive strong customer engagement. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new pet customers to both banners. Neighbor's Club membership currently represents over 85% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 50%, an increase of nearly 3 points year-over-year. Overall, Neighbor's Club membership now exceeds 38 million, and as a percent of our sales reached a record 80%. With our Life out Strategy, we have built on Tractor Supply's long-standing commitment to invest in our powerful flywheel. We've substantially transformed our business and are operating from a higher level of performance. We've not given back any of the gains that we've made over the last five years, and we delivered against our strategy, and we're very excited about the future. As we planned for 2025, we're forecasting strong net sales growth of 5% to 7% and comp sales performance of 1% to 3%. We anticipate that the headwinds we've been facing will moderate as we move through the year and that we continue our share gains. We expect product deflation should be relatively neutral by mid-2025, and additionally, we see signs of stabilization in both personal consumption expenditure and the balance of goods versus services as well as in the pet food category. As it relates to the new presidential administration, while there are many unknowns that we acknowledge, for example, tariffs, we are confident in our ability to navigate these circumstances as they evolve. Additionally, I'll note that many of these unknowns are not Tractor Supply specific. And on most fronts, our business profile is attractive on a relative basis to other retailers and companies. As we shared at our recent investment community day in December, we remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when market conditions return to neutral. Tractor Supply is a unique and highly differentiated retailer. We have a history of executing with discipline on our strategy, delivering strong financial results and continue to expand our competitive moat. We continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy. We're excited about the continued evolution of our Life Out Here strategy that builds on our strengths, continues the momentum of our existing strategy and launches new initiatives that increase our total addressable market to $225 billion. We're entering the New Year with momentum and opportunity. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt Barton : Thanks Hal and hello to everyone on the call. Let's start with some key insights for the fourth quarter and full year. I'll spend the bulk of my time on our outlook for 2025. We had a solid performance given the overall conditions for the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales increased 0.6%, driven by strong comparable average transaction increase of 2.3%, partially offset by a comparable average ticket decrease of 1.7%. Of note, unit volumes were solid and the ticket pressure was principally from average unit retail. For the fourth quarter, we always believe that weather trumps the holiday. Typically, the winter weather has a much greater impact to the fourth quarter. And once again, that is how this year played out. In addition, we continue to face the ongoing headwind of deflation in key product categories. We estimate that deflation had approximately 100 basis point drag on our comp sales performance in the quarter. Most of the deflation pressure came from commodity-based products consistent with the recent trends. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw a positive impact from the early October hurricanes. While the warmer-than-usual temperatures in late October and November presented some challenges, December had a modest improvement in the weather and solid holiday performance, demonstrating our resilience and ability to adapt to varying conditions. Turning the category performance for the quarter. We had strong comps in our seasonal department as well as truck tool and hardware with both performing better than chain average. Our consumable, usable and edible products performed in line with chain average. Notably, we had mid-single-digit unit growth as we continue to believe we are gaining share in these categories overall. The strength of our unit growth in Q was offset by ongoing deflation. No doubt the warm weather in November and to a lesser extent, December weighed on our winter seasonal business. Overall, our spring and summer seasonal categories drove positive comp sales with Zero Turn and front-engine mowers, both up double-digits. This is indicative of the unseasonably warm weather we had in the quarter. Cold weather-related categories, such as insulated outerwear and heating modestly underperformed chain average due to the warm weather conditions. Big ticket performance continued to outperform in the low single-digits. We experienced strength in hurricane response categories like generators. Additionally, grilling, mowers, trailers and truck toolboxes all performed well. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time, on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance for the holiday season. Moving on to gross margin. Gross margin decreased nine basis points to 35.2% from the prior year's fourth quarter. It is worth calling out that we were lapping our most difficult gross margin comparison of the quarter with 129 basis points of expansion in the prior year. Our performance was relatively in line with our expectations. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 26.8%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, including higher depreciation and the onboarding of a new distribution center and modest deleverage of our fixed costs, given the level of comparable store sales growth. These factors were partially offset by the team's disciplined focus on productivity and our ongoing emphasis on cost control. We did have a modest benefit from our ongoing sale leaseback strategy. This quarter, we had a similar number of existing store sales as the prior year with a slightly higher average gain per store. Operating margin declined 69 basis points for the quarter to 8.4%. Now, let's move to our outlook for 2025. As I have previously shared, navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have a long track record of successfully managing through diverse market conditions. The needs-based nature of our business, combined with our deep understanding of these dynamics, allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. The same can be said about tariffs. As Hal commented in his opening remarks, there are certainly a number of unknowns at this time on this important topic. This is a team that has been cycle tested with lessons learned from the prior administration. For instance, we have continued to diversify our country of origin for imports. We have been scenario planning and are prepared to address as any proposed actions take effect. It is important to remember that this is a topic that affects all of retail. We are differentiated as we only have about 12% or so of our sales that are direct imports and have a large key business that is domestically sourced. Given the fluid nature of the discussion on tariffs and the number of unknowns, our guidance does not assume any changes in tariffs at this time. We successfully managed through tariffs in prior cycles, we will remain flexible and nimble to adapt to the changing environment. For fiscal 2025, we are forecasting net sales growth of 5% to 7% to $15.6 billion to $15.9 billion. Approximately four points of this growth is driven by new stores and Allivet. With a purchase price of $135 million, we anticipate Allivet adding more than $100 million to our net sales and accretive to earnings. Comparable store sales are anticipated to increase 1% to 3%. We expect modest gross margin expansion of about 20 to 40 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost and price management and our exclusive brands and retail media initiatives. We anticipate a relatively stable and consistent overall transportation market. We forecast the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase about 10% with a higher growth rate in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth rates, as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate, we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales. Second, we are investing in our Life Out Here 2030, strategic initiatives. In order to launch our direct sales and Final Mile initiatives, we are planning a net investment of about 15 to 20 basis points of operating margin into these exciting opportunities for growth. In 2025, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. As we recently indicated at our Investment Community Day, we expect to sell an incremental two to four existing stores to fund the step-up in new stores from 80 to 90 in 2025. We anticipate these sales will occur across the year with a similar EPS contribution as in 2024 in total. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.6% to 10%, centering around our 2024 performance. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of a little over two times. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.2% to 22.5%. Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $2.10 to $2.22. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $650 million to $725 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales. This net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds from the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be around $1 billion. Our capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 90 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening about 10 Petsense stores this year. Our new store pipeline remains exceptionally strong, continue to exceed historical averages in both sales and profitability. We expect our store opening cadence to be in line with 2024. As we announced this week, we anticipate starting construction of our 11th distribution center in Idaho later this year with operations commencing in late 2026 or early 2027. This is an exciting expansion of our DC network that will allow us to more effectively service our existing stores and new store growth opportunities in the Pacific Northwest. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2025, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $525 million to $600 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 1% to 2%. Now, I'd like to walk through a few items consider for the calendarization of our expectations. As always, we believe the best way to look at our results is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2025 guidance. We anticipate that comp sales will be modestly stronger in the second half of the year as our compares ease and the headwind from deflation continues to moderate. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year, along with flat to slightly positive average ticket. We anticipate that deflation will be a modest headwind in the first half of the year. We believe we are nearing trough now having successfully managed through the deflation of 2023 and 2024. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be relatively consistent between the first half and second half of the year. As we see it today, our forecast calls for the first half of the year to have marginally better operating margin performance than the second half as we begin to cycle recent transportation efficiencies. Specific to the first quarter, we've had a solid start to the year given the recent cold weather trends. As a reminder, January last year was also very cold with strong comps. We are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter, recognizing we have a lot of quarter ahead of us. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted EPS is anticipated to be relatively consistent with the prior year as our positive sales growth is somewhat offset by our investments in the business. We are planning for continued gross margin expansion to be offset by incremental investments to launch our strategic initiatives and the operational costs for our new Arkansas distribution center, which opened in mid-2024. As a consequence, operating margin is anticipated to be flat to slightly below prior year. To wrap-up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market. We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2025 as we self-fund our Life Out Here 2030 initiatives. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Hal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. As we shared in December at our Investment Community Day, we're embarking on the next leg of growth for Tractor Supply with our Life Out Here 2030 strategy. This strategy is designed to continue invest in what's working as well as begin investments in several new opportunities, creating horizons of growth that we expect to last through the end of the decade. Key initiatives in our Life Out Here strategy will continue to be our Project Fusion and Garden Center rollouts. Both of these projects are working well and delivering compelling returns through improved space productivity. In 2025, these initiatives will be complemented with enhanced localization capabilities. Specifically, the team has developed data-driven archetypes that tailor approximately 25% of store space to better reflect customer need and further optimize the incremental sales opportunity of each unique site. Going forward, all new stores and our Fusion remodels will have localized space allocation and assortment based on their respective architypes. Turning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to continue to capitalize on this unique, strategic asset. A significant focus for us this year will be to bring our members PetRx through our recent Allivet acquisition. The acquisition of Allivet expands our total addressable market by $15 billion to $225 billion. Allivet has a proven platform to make pet ownership easier by providing convenient access to brand-name medications, expert pharmacy advice and convenient reordering with its AutoShip program. Our efforts in Q1 are focused on integrating Allivet's catalog onto tractorsupply.com and updating a member's Neighbor's Club profile to include their prescription and veterinarian information. We look forward to providing our 38 million Neighbor's Club members with a value-added pet and animal prescription service and introducing Tractor Supply to Allivet's customers. As Kurt mentioned, we're investing in this year in several new key strategic initiatives, especially direct sales and Final Mile. It is critical to get them off to a strong start, and the team is keenly focused on our multiyear journey to capture the significant opportunity with these initiatives. In direct sales, our efforts in the first half are focused on building a scalable field sales model and launching Version 1 of our business-to-business selling platform. In Final Mile, our efforts in the first half are focused on hardening our existing delivery hubs, activating inventory across more locations and bringing bulk online orders in-house for delivery. While our long-term strategy sets the foundation for sustained growth, our 2025 operating plans are designed to deliver measurable results today, ensuring we continue to meet our evolving customers' needs and build momentum towards achieving our long-term goals. As mentioned, the year has started solid, and our teams have been busy supporting our customers for all their winter needs as the dependable supplier of the Out Here Lifestyle. From heating fuel and heating pellets to insulated winter clothing to livestock feed, we are highly engaged in ensuring our customers have what they need to deal with the recent winter storms and recovery. As the calendar will soon turn to spring, we've already transitioned over 600 of our stores to our spring sets and the remainder will do over the next couple of months. Our merchant teams have done an excellent job bringing value and innovation to our lineups for spring. Examples include expanding Weber grilling to all stores and launching exclusive zero-turn mowers from Cub Cadet and the second year of the Toro Havoc as well as introducing new national live goods programs. And we have so much more, and I look forward to sharing more details on spring in our Q1 earnings call. As always, we are laser-focused on our C.U.E categories. In our Companion Animal segment, we're pleased to launch new products, both in-store and online. We recently launched 4health shreds. We expanded our temptations assortment in cat, and we introduced new freeze-dried and shelf-stable treats. In the market now, we have our annual Pet Appreciation days with a month of targeted savings offers and in-store events to drive excitement. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our over 1,000 pet wash locations. And last year, we conducted over 1.8 million pet washes, including a record-breaking 500,000 plus in Q4. Our pet aisle is more robust than ever, featuring familiar favorites as well as new unique offerings that deliver the quality our customers expect at incredible value. In our Animal segment, spring at Tractor Supply means it's time for our annual spring Chick Days. The arrival of chicks at our stores is a sure sign of spring and creates strong retail theater in our stores. Backyard poultry continues to see significant engagement with our customers, highlighting a shift towards sustainable and self-reliance living. Whether as pets or as a source of eggs, chicks are both a practical and enjoyable hobby for many and are often referred to as the third pet. We have more shopping trends and insights than ever on our poultry customers and are able to build out more targeted campaigns based on where they are in their journey. As our customers build and maintain their flocks, we have everything they need for feed, treats, toys and an exciting lineup of new chicken coops. Our retail philosophy is that Chick Days is a great gateway for our customers to deepen their relationship with Tractor Supply, and that enables Tractor Supply then to be viewed as a resource for all things related to homesteading beyond the poultry category. Earlier this week, we announced a multiyear strategic licensing partnership with Field & Stream. Beginning in June, Tractor Supply customers could shop a variety of hunting and outdoor Field & Stream branded products. We're excited about the opportunity this partnership presents and look forward to providing more details in future earnings calls. As the season turns to spring, I hope you get a chance to visit our stores and see the actions and initiatives coming to life. Our future remains exceptionally bright and exciting. Our upcoming initiatives, scale and capabilities demonstrate our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're excited about the future and look forward to continuing our journey of growth and innovation in the channel. I'd like to close where I started, by extending my gratitude to our team members for their unwavering dedication to each other and to serving our customers. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing us as their trusted supply for Life Out Here, and also call -- plus communities for embracing us as an integral part of our hometowns. With that, operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus my one question on comp transactions, which were positive and a good sign of health. Can you talk about transaction breadth in two ways, geographically and then if you can look at it across immature and mature stores, how balanced is it? Hal Lawton : Good morning Simeon, and thanks for the question. We were pleased with our comp transaction growth in Q4. And the breadth was widespread across both categories and geographies. What I would say is where we had weather activity, we saw stronger comp transactions as one would imagine. But our comp transaction growth was strong, particularly as it relates to average ticket growth across all regions of the country and across our categories as well. I'll note the numerous call outs I made on customers, customer counts and customer activity and customer retention as well. But we were very pleased with the comp transaction growth and expect comp transactions to continue to be strong force in 2025. And really, as you know, comp transactions have been one, a key component of our growth over the last five years, around half of our total growth over the last five years has been driven by comp transactions. And I think it's a hallmark and a differentiator for us as it relates to the rest of retail. On the new store front, new stores continue to perform right in line with our expectations. New store openings are in that 4.2, 4.3 range on a first-year basis, very much in line with our expectations. The IRRs are performing in line, the operating profit margin rates are performing in line and that's if you look at our 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 classes across the Board, the 2021 far outperformed given the moment of time we were in, but 2022, 2023 and 2024 have all been very consistent. And, of course, that is the vast majority of the customers that shop our new stores are new and drive a number of incremental transactions. Of course, that wouldn't be in our comp transaction number that would be a non-comp. But very pleased with the transactions and new customer counts coming along with our new stores and their kind of their opening profile. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, I mean for the question. Thanks for the question. Good luck. Hal Lawton : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Hal, Kurt, Seth. Kurt, you mentioned localization initiatives and the Field & Stream partnership as well. So I was hoping maybe if you can walk us back to the Analyst Day where you explored the customer segmentation work that you guys executed upon. Any way to sort of reframe up the opportunity as you think about localization and sort of what drove the strategic partnership with Field & Stream. How do we sort of contextualize the product category opportunities, the potential lift in sales per square foot that you see in the back of localization? Just any sort of color for us that helps us think about what it means for comp transactions and new store productivity as well as the maturation curve of the stores themselves. Seth Estep : Hey, Steven, this is Seth. Thanks for the question. I would separate both of those kind of individually, and I'll spend a little bit on both. First and foremost, just kind of going back to the localization commentary. I would say it remains really consistent with what we said at ICD and what we said in prepared remarks. Relative to just knowing the amount of opportunity we have to adjust particularly our macro space floor planning when we go out to our Fusion and our new stores to just maximize that space productivity. And like we shared at ICD, anticipate that we'll continue to deliver likely an incremental low single digits lift as we go to implement those as we adjust, call it, 25% of the floor plans as we start to roll those out. We're always looking at ways that we can localize our assortments. And if we were to go back to 2019 and to where we are today, one of the things that we continue to see is that the wildlife and hunting categories for us in recreation have been among the fastest growing, and it's where a lot of our consumers are continuing to respond with us. So, we were looking for ways in which we could continue to drive some meaningful assortments, meaningful partnerships, specifically in that space because it's been very strong growth, but we know that we have a tremendous amount of growth opportunity in front of us. So, we're very excited about the Field & Stream partnership that we announced yesterday and Hal mentioned prepared remarks. It really will be a multiyear journey for us starting midyear this year, specifically tailored more towards that wildlife category. And then as we roll into late this year and then into next year, it will start to be expanded into like an exclusive line of apparel and other things that the brand really resonates with our shoppers. And then also, there's some very unique marketing opportunities where our collective brands can come together across all the channels. So, I do think the partnership is reflective of how we're looking at both localization and our category assortments in general, but very excited about both those opportunities. Thanks for the question. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Peter Keith : Hey. Thanks, guys. You mentioned the poultry category, and I'm wondering, one of my favorite topics with backyard chickens, if the rising egg prices here is starting to drive some acceleration in that category. And as we think about egg prices potentially continuing to go up this year, maybe reflect back on what you saw in 2023 when there also seem to be meaningful chicken demand. And what did you see in your results in terms of like customer acquisition and traffic. Seth Estep : Yes. This is Seth, Peter. Thanks for the question. Backyard poultry, Backyard Flock, like as you mentioned, it's one of your favorite topics you said, it's also one of ours, its core to our customers, as we mentioned. About one in five of our current shoppers participate in the hobby. It's well above the national average. We are very excited about this year's Chick Days. It's a chance for not only for our current shoppers as we continue to dive in with personalization to grow their flocks with all the unique guidance and expanded items that Hal talked about here at the end of the prepared remarks. But one thing that we also saw like back in 2023 was also a great entry point into the hobby when we saw egg prices continue to elevate at the same time. So, as we look at this year's event, we're very excited about our current customers continue to expand, the flock continue to engage with us, to be their primary destination, but also are excited about the potential opportunity to continue to engage new shoppers in the category which then that we see over time, it just continues to deepen that relationship with them, so more to come. Look forward to discussing the results of Chick Days as it continues to roll out over the next few weeks, and it will be in stores here shortly. Peter Keith : Sounds great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Hey guys, good morning. So, you discussed macro headwinds potentially moderating through 2025, and it seems like that's what's reflected in the comp guidance for the year. Can you just elaborate on what that means specifically for Tractor Supply? Because in a lot of ways, your business has been much more stable this year than a lot of other cyclical businesses. So, what categories have really under-punched, any signs that maybe that's starting to improve? And then if you could also speak to big ticket, perhaps in that context, big ticket has been a nice outlier for you this year, low double-digit growth, although it did moderate in the fourth quarter. So, if you could just speak to that and remind us on how you're thinking about some of categories. Thanks so much. Hal Lawton : Good morning, Seth, and thanks for the question. I reference back to my prepared remarks and kind of highlight three factors that really have weighed on our business over the last 18 to 24 months and then comment on our outlook for those in 2025. Those three factors that I'd highlight would be the in PCE, the reversion from goods to services spend, the second would be underlying deflation in our commodity-related items. And then the third would be stabilization of the pet category. All 3 of those, as you know, are headwinds that we've been facing. And we've been very kind of transparent on the impact those have had on our business on things like average ticket, et cetera. As we look into 2025, we do see modernization, neutralization, stabilization, kind of pick your word as more so as it goes through the year. So, if you look at goods and services, it's basically reached its pre-COVID levels now. It's mid-68 versus mid-31. That's very much back in line, maybe 0.5 point to go there. On pet, the kind of stabilization or neutral nature of that industry over the last 12 months has been well documented. We do see that business recovering to low single-digit growth this year and our business accordingly growing alongside of that as we are a share gainer in that category. And then as it relates to deflation, we are -- we see light at the end of the tunnel on that. If we just take our average unit cost, our average unit retails across our commodity-related items, we hit the -- we start comping over top of all that between April and May of this coming year. And then I'd also just point out on that at steady state point in time. If you look at the commodity markets right now, if anything, they're kind of surging up. If you look at, say, like corn prices, which we've talked about is the commodity that we're most correlated with corn is trading now in kind of that high-400s, 490 range, really at like a 15-month high now. We aren't seeing that make its way into pricing yet. But if anything, I'd say that is a potential tailwind. So, as we look out, we do see kind of light at the end of the tunnel on these macro factors that have been headwinds for us. And we think as we get into the year, those forces will become less and less of a headwind. That's reflected in our guidance for the year, which is a comp of 1% to 3%. And we said that we expect kind of sequential improvement from our comps from the first half to the second half as well. And the final thing I'll call out is we have had a solid start to the year, which gives us more confidence in our guidance. Of course, we've got 11 months still to go, but it's been nice to have the cold winter weather in the first month of the year to particular help us lap last year's cold weather and start out with a relatively solid start to the year. So thanks, Seth. I appreciate the question. Kurt Barton : Hal, I'll just mention his -- Seth's last question on big ticket, which I think is a great topic as well. So, Seth, this is Kurt. As we've talked about through all of 2024, I mean, the merchants did an excellent job coming off of two years of declining big ticket sales with newness, innovation competitive pricing, great financing. And so we recognize in our guidance that we're cycling strong big-ticket comps in 2025. But a lot of 2024 was a comeback of some of the lack of newness and the customers responded. And we see that big ticket as more at its new stabilized platform, and we look at 2025 as we're bringing together all the reasons, the newness, the competitive pricing, love our opportunities in 2025. Big ticket is expected to run positively more in line with chain average in 2025. But what we're bringing in zero-turns, trailers and a number of areas that you'll start to see this year is we've got good reason to be optimistic on our ability to continue to comp, the comp on big ticket in 2025. Seth Sigman : Very helpful. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wondered if we could focus our question on the operating margin guide. I think the lower end of it maybe seems a little bit lower than what you were talking to in December, which we thought was around flat. First, is that right? And if so, what's driving the change? And then can you talk to the range? Is that range concurrent with what you expect to do on the top line in 2025? Or are there other things that we should consider driving that range of outcomes? Kurt Barton : Yes. Hey Kate, this is Kurt. Thanks for the question. On operating margin, as I mentioned in my remarks, we estimate and forecast that our 2025 operating margin would be more in line and center pointed around the 2024 operating margin. To your second part of your question, the operating margin range that we gave is more concurrent and proportional with the comp sales range of 1% to 3%. So, allowing for the appropriate flow-through under the low-end and high-end scenarios on the comp sales range, the 9.6% to 10% operating margin reflects that. We've got a significant opportunity for growth in this business as we've talked about the 2030 initiatives. So, we are purposely investing to be able to launch those programs. And we're self-funding those with gross margin expansion and efficiencies that we have achieved and continue to target on the SG&A side. So, we're excited about 2025. We're going to continue to strive to hit the high end of our targets. We believe we've got gross margin expansion that allows us in this year to be able to do both things, grow the business and be able to maintain the operating margin. And that's the key message on both the top and bottom-line. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is on the outlook for this year, which you noted that the business has already started off with a solid beginning given some of the weather and you're guiding to an acceleration over the course of the year. And then on top of that, you outlined some positive drivers for -- that could impact the business. So, A, should we interpret the 1% to 3% comp outlook as conservative or what would stand in the way of potential upside from that? And B, if there is comp upside, how should that flow to the bottom-line? Meaning, would you choose to potentially proactively reinvest some of the upside back in further investments in your initiatives such that there may not be as much upside even if the comps outperformed? Thank you. Hal Lawton : Hey Michael, thanks for the question. I'll answer in two parts the way you ask it. On our comp first, obviously, when we set our guidance, we try not to be impacted too much by the first three or four weeks of the year in terms of sales and try to look over a full 52-week period. With that as context, we certainly see the broader macro conditions like talked about with Simeon's question at the beginning, kind of more neutralizing and some of them, perhaps, even becoming positive in nature for us as we get through the year. And so I think that's what leads us to the kind of sequential improvement as the year goes on. And that's without any sort of consideration for the aberrations of weather and how they might impact one month here and there through the year. But we feel very good about our 1% to 3%. We think that's -- we're highly confident in it, and we think it's the right place to start here at the beginning of the year. What I -- as it relates to if we had comp upside, I think, obviously, there's a variety of scenarios that that we'll evaluate as we go through the year and would be a great scenario for us to be considering. What I would say is, I referenced kind of back way the way we've thought about it in the past, and we've had comp outperformance, we'll evaluate our current initiatives, how they're running, how their investments in those initiatives are going. If we were to lean more into these initiatives, what would be the result of that incremental investment, and/or what other needs do we have in the business. And then obviously, we would evaluate the flow-through as well. But as we've indicated long-term, when we see our comp growth rates in our long-term guidance range, in that 3%, 4%, 5% range, we do expect to leverage on operating margin rate and have that improve. And so I would also say that if you saw comp outperformance in the year, you would see operating margin flow towards the higher end of our guidance, and we would update you accordingly through the year on that. But again, just stepping back, we're very, very excited about the beginning of the year. We feel good about our plans for the year and have some good momentum as we head into 2025 here. We've got a lot of new initiatives to embark on top of some really, solid existing initiatives or creating real value for our shareholders and excited about the horizons for growth that we have over the next few years. Thanks, Michael, for the question. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Good luck. Operator : Thank year-over-year. The next question comes from line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, maybe just jumping around the Allivet. Is there any seasonality in that business that we should think about? And I know you said it's going to be accretive or slightly accretive to the earnings this year, just on how it maybe impacts the P&L. There's -- I would assume it's higher gross margin, but kind of curious your view there. And then if you can even frame maybe the magnitude of the earnings lift that you get here in year one from Allivet. Thank you. Kurt Barton : Yes, Peter, for the most part, Allivet is pretty consistent and stable. There's some seasonality. You might not be able to see it significantly with the size of Tractor Supply. But if you think about the spring summer, there is a bit of a peak on flea, tick and some of those type categories. But I -- we look at it as it's a pretty stable, consistent business. It's got a solid operating margin. Over the long-term, we expect that while it's accretive to earnings that we have the ability to grow their operating margins. And the long-term outlook is that that Allivet, when you look at level of business on the Rx side of it, over this five-year period of time, we can see Allivet equaling and even surpassing Tractor Supply level operating margins because it's that strong of business. Right now, when you think of 2025, our focus is on the top line and getting Neighbor's Club members onboarded onto Allivet that, their platform, their subscription model. And so there'll be -- while accretive, there'll be some investments in the onboarding and the transition year, and we'll be able to share more beyond 2025 as how we see that growing in the future, but great platform, a great team. We purchased, as Hal mentioned, the technology, the resources, license in all the states enable for us to be able to ramp quickly with them. So very excited about this opportunity, which is certainly, we believe, a one plus one is certainly more than two. Peter Benedict : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to just focus on comp in general. So can you give a sense of what the comp waterfall contribution is or the new store waterfall contribution is to the comp and how you think about that going forward? And then tie that in with how to think about new store productivity? Kurt Barton : Yes, sure. Hi, Karen, on new stores hitting both comp and new store productivity, first, when we -- I'll hit new store productivity first. When we talk about new store productivity, profitability, we look at it on a net of cannibalization. That's how we view its impact. That's how we view its IRR. And we've continue to be consistent that our new stores, while there's a mix, some we drop into existing markets, some into brand-new markets, there's some cannibalization, and we continue to have net contribution to comp after cannibalization from new stores. It's a modest contributor. If I would say of all the contributors we talk about that build up to our comp sales from the strategic initiatives, it is a modest level. But we are net contribution to our comp sales. And so as we as we ramp up, we've planned in 2025 from like 80 to 90, and ramped up from 70 to 80, you're seeing the non-comp growth from new stores, continuing to increase. And that has, over time, in that five-year maturation, we view it while we're talking 5, 10, 15 type level basis points. But over the next five years, that's a comp contributor as our new stores ramp from 70 up to 100 over the next few years. And then Hal mentioned earlier, new store productivity, I can't reiterate more while I acknowledge in the last 18 months with Orscheln and refining some of the square footage, new store productivity has been extremely consistent and right in line from all of our targets over the last three or four years, and we are consistently performing at or above our markets and excited about the production and the performance of our new stores. Karen Short : Great. Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : Alice, I think we've got time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. The next question is from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho. Your line is now open. David Bellinger : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. It's on the gross margins, which are down very slightly year-over-year this quarter. I think that was the first time since late 2022. We were just a little unclear on the drivers other than the difficult comparison in the prior year. Just any more detail you can help us with anything on the promo activity and the shorter holiday, how that played into it? And then just secondly, how should we think about the year-on-year gross margin progression throughout 2025. Any specific drivers you've got baked in, like retail media or some other factors? Kurt Barton : Yes. Thanks David. On gross margin for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, it came in very much in line with our expectations. The Q3 call, I forecasted that we were anticipating flat year-over-year gross margin, knowing that we were up against 129 basis point growth. There was probably 20 to 30 basis points back in the prior year that was very unique to that quarter -- in fourth quarter 2023. So we continue to have solid performance in gross margin. We were cycling that. There really wasn't much that was unique, and it wasn't promotional. While there was a step-up in promotional in fourth quarter year-over-year, for us, we had targeted promotions. We had vendors' partnership that helped to maintain the gross margin. So, there's a little bits and pieces here and there that shifted from flat to nine basis points. Part of that is mix in the quarter. And that's probably the only meaningful items I can mention. It gives us all the confidence on our gross margin plan. As you think about 2025, as I mentioned, gross margin in the first half, slightly more favorable than the back half. And what you'd see is, we're going to start lapping some of the last or most recent transportation efficiencies by about midyear. And we'll begin to see a little bit more benefit though in the back half from exclusive brands, which Seth has talked about launching, the retail media is a little more beneficial, but the net-net is, in our expectations for gross margin, you'll see a modest -- we forecast today a more modestly higher gross margin performance in the first half and in the second half. David Bellinger : Great. Thank you. Mary Winn Pilkington : I think that -- thanks, David. Just to wrap our call up. So, I'm around all day and coming up next week as well if anybody needs anything. So, please don't hesitate to reach out and look forward to talking to you on our Q1 call in April. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
